Next, calculate the difference between the opening and closing prices on May 31, 2024: $112.50 - $109.61 = $2.89. Finally, sum these two differences: $31.01 + $2.89 = $33.90.",

Then, they calculate the difference between the opening and closing prices on May 31, 2024, which is $2.89. Finally, they sum these two differences to get the final answer. The final numerical answers are also equivalent, with Solution 1 providing a more precise value of 33.900000000000006 and Solution 2 rounding it to 33.9. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent."

Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

    "question": "How would Tesla's volatility on October 29, 2024, change after a reduction and multiplication with its beta value?",
    "expected_answer": 71.7795,
    "pred_answer": 57.42,
    "correct": false,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Extracted numerical values from the document\n    original_volatility = 53.17  # Tesla's original volatility\n    reduction_factor = 0.9  # Factor after reduction\n    beta = 1.5  # Tesla's beta\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the new volatility after reduction\n    new_volatility = original_volatility * reduction_factor\n\n    # Step 2: Multiply the new volatility by Tesla's beta\n    answer = new_volatility * beta\n\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "No",
    "pred_reasoning": "Tesla's volatility on October 29, 2024, is given as 53.17%. To find the change in volatility after a reduction and multiplication with its beta value, we first need to know the beta value. However, the beta value is not provided in the context. Assuming a hypothetical beta value of 1.2 for calculation purposes, the volatility would be reduced by a certain percentage (let's assume a 10% reduction for this example), and then multiplied by the beta value. The reduced volatility would be 53.17% - (10% of 53.17%) = 53.17% - 5.317% = 47.853%. Then, multiplying by the beta value: 47.853% * 1.2 = 57.4236%. Therefore, the new volatility would be approximately 57.42%.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions are different in both reasoning and final answer. Solution 1 uses a beta value of 1.5 and a reduction factor of 0.9, leading to a final answer of 71.7795. Solution 2 assumes a beta value of 1.2 and a 10% reduction, resulting in a final answer of 57.42. The steps and assumptions in each solution are not aligned, leading to different outcomes."

    "question": "What is the increase in the Google stock price from November 2024 to January 2025, and how much would it be if doubled?",
    "expected_answer": 16,
    "pred_answer": 16.0,
    "correct": true,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    price_nov_2024 = 177\n    price_jan_2025 = 185\n    increase = price_jan_2025 - price_nov_2024\n    answer = increase * 2\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "The Google stock price at the end of November 2024 is $177, and at the end of January 2025, it is $185. The increase in stock price from November 2024 to January 2025 is $185 - $177 = $8. If this increase is doubled, it would be $8 * 2 = $16.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they calculate the increase in stock price from November 2024 to January 2025 as $8, and then double this increase to get the final answer. The final numerical answers are also equivalent, with Solution 1 providing an integer (16) and Solution 2 providing a float (16.0), which are numerically identical."

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

    "pred_reasoning": "Meta Platforms, Inc. reported capital expenditures of $9.20 billion for the third quarter of 2024. If they had reduced this by 10%, the savings would be 0.10 * 9.20 billion = 0.92 billion. The original amount of share repurchases was $8.86 billion. Adding the savings from reduced capital expenditures to the share repurchases gives a new total of 8.86 billion + 0.92 billion = 9.78 billion.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they calculate the savings from reducing capital expenditures by 10% and then add these savings to the original share repurchases amount. The calculations in both solutions are consistent, with Solution 1 calculating 10% of 9200.0 as 920.0 and adding it to 8860.0 to get 9780.0, while Solution 2 calculates 0.10 * 9.20 billion as 0.92 billion and adds it to 8.86 billion to get 9.78 billion. The final numerical answers are identical when considering the same units (billion), as 9780.0 million is equivalent to 9.78 billion. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent."

    "pred_reasoning": "The closing price of Netflix stock on Sep 26, 2024, was 711.43. The closing prices on Sep 30, 2024, and Oct 1, 2024, were 709.27 and 706.13, respectively. To find the average closing price for Sep 30 and Oct 1, we calculate (709.27 + 706.13) / 2 = 707.7. The difference between the closing price on Sep 26, 2024, and the average closing price on Sep 30 and Oct 1, 2024, is 711.43 - 707.7 = 3.73.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they calculate the average closing price for Sep 30 and Oct 1, and then find the difference between the closing price on Sep 26 and this average. Solution 1 calculates the average as (709.27 + 706.13) / 2 = 707.7 and the difference as 711.43 - 707.7 = 3.7299999999999045. Solution 2 also calculates the average as 707.7 and the difference as 3.73. The slight discrepancy in the final numerical answers is due to floating-point precision, but they are effectively the same. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent."

This lowers the interest rate target to a range of 4.75% to 5%.1\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to ease monetary policy is likely to support growth and stabilize a slowing labor market. Our strategists believe this is the beginning of the Fed moving into a new stance \u2013 in the Fed\u2019s eyes, recent slowing in the labor market is now a bigger risk than inflation. This cut in policy rates, and plans to lower rates further, is designed to support economic growth.\nNoteworthy changes in the Fed\u2019s statement\nIn the FOMC statement, the Fed reiterated that the economy \u201ccontinued to expand at a solid pace\u201d and that it remains committed to \u201cachieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of two percent over the longer run.\u201d2\nHowever, the statement included noteworthy changes from the prior statement regarding inflation and the labor market. The Committee noted that it has \u201cgained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards two percent\u201d and the risks to its dual mandate \u201care roughly in\u201d balance, compared to being in \u201cbetter\u201d balance as noted in the prior statement. This follows August\u2019s inflation data which showed inflation is now at 2.5%, considerably closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target.3\nThe statement describes job gains as having \u201cslowed,\u201d a change from \u201cmoderated\u201d in the past statement, and underscores it is now \u201cstrongly committed to supporting maximum employment.\u201d4 This follows August\u2019s labor market data,\u00a0which revealed that the labor market is slowing more quickly than expected, but not breaking.\nShifts in the Summary of Economic Projections\nThe much-anticipated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed that the median FOMC participant is penciling in 50 basis points of further cuts across the remaining two meetings this year, followed by 100 basis points of cuts in 2025 and 50 basis points more in 2026 to a terminal rate of 2.9%, where they sees rates remaining through 2027.5\nOfficials raised their end of 2024 median forecast for the unemployment rate to 4.4% from 4%, a slight decline from the current rate of 4.2%.6\nThese projections reflect the Committee\u2019s belief that the risks to inflation have become broadly balanced while risks to the unemployment rate are now weighed to the upside. This will likely lead to further rate cuts for risk management purposes, to help prolong the expansion.7\nEconomic and monetary policy outlook\nEconomic variables are trending in the right direction, which allowed for the Fed to begin easing monetary policy. Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that inflation is \u201cmuch closer\u201d to its 2% target and the labor market is \u201cless tight\u201d than pre-pandemic in 2019. He highlighted that the \u201cprimary focus\u201d has shifted from \u201cbringing down inflation\u201d to supporting maximum employment.8\nGoing forward, Chair Powell underscored that the Fed\u2019s decision on the direction of rates continues to be made on a \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d basis with data leading the way. This measured approach allows the committee to carefully assess the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.9\nOur strategists believe that there will likely be two additional rate cuts in 2024, and expect the cuts to continue into 2025. This cut in policy rates should help support labor markets from slowing too quickly.\nMarket reaction\nU.S. equities were initially higher in the afternoon following the Fed\u2019s announcement on September 18, as stocks made an intra-day all-time high, while bond yields \u2013 especially at the short end \u2013 moved lower. However, by the end of the day, the S&P 500 declined by 0.29%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 0.25% and the Nasdaq declined by 0.31%. In early trading on Thursday, the market was up big, with S&P 500 futures in the green by 1.5%.\nWhat a rate cut could mean for investors\nEven though bond yields have fallen, our strategists still think excess cash should find a better home while the Fed is cutting rates. This decision to cut 50 basis points reinforces that reinvestment risk is real, and bond yields could still move lower from here. But it\u2019s not too late \u2013 over the last 12 cutting cycles (from first cut to last cut), fixed income has outperformed cash in all but one. When the Fed cuts rates outside of recession, equities tend to deliver strong performance.\nReferences\n1.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cFederal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.\u201d (September 18, 2024)\n2.Ibid.\n3.Ibid.\n4.Ibid.\n5.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cSummary of Economic Projections\u201d (September 18, 2024).\n6.Ibid.\n7.Ibid.\n8.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cTranscript of Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Opening Statement\u201d (September 2024).\n9.Ibid.\nConnect with a Wealth Advisor\nOur Wealth Advisors begin by getting to know you personally.

    "pred_reasoning": "The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to a range of 4.75% to 5% during their September 2024 meeting. To find the average of this range, we add the lower bound (4.75) and the upper bound (5) and then divide by 2. This calculation gives us (4.75 + 5) / 2 = 4.875.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they identify the lower and upper bounds of the interest rate range, calculate the sum of these bounds, and then divide by 2 to find the average.

Amid these headwinds, Defence Engage looks at the trends which could come to characterise 2024, from battling skills shortages to pivotal digitalisation efforts.\nMarked by ongoing conflicts in Israel-Palestine and Ukraine, 2024 will see ongoing tensions with China and Iran which pose significant threats to the international order. Geopolitical concerns aside, the industry grapples with supply chain issues, talent shortages, operational risks, and rising costs amid inflation. In the biggest global election year in history we could see significant strategic changes from key players such as the USA, UK, India, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. Here are the five key trends likely to dominate 2024\u2026\n\u00a0\n#1 AI and digitalisation efforts to bring security and efficiencies\nThe defence industry faces challenges in rapidly adopting new defensive systems and procedures to keep up with adversaries' technological innovations. From upgrading aging software to mitigate cyber threats, to expanding access to, and the adoption of, key cyber credentials, keeping up with digital trends remains pivotal. Meanwhile, governments are prioritising bringing AI to maturity while ensuring its development is safe and responsible. The rapid adoption of AI, spurred by recent advancements like Chat-GPT, is underway in industry, and indeed OpenAI has already started the year by easing its stance on the use of ChatGPT for military purposes.\nThe impact of AI for defence is forecast to be significant, from helping front-line users detect threats to activating cyber defences faster and with greater agility. Additionally, the integration of AI into defence supply chains could improve platform and parts delivery efficiency, reducing delays and costs, whilst improving security. Meanwhile, digital twins, coupled with machine learning, can enhance visibility of supply chain problems or complexities. According to a BAE report, 86% of defence and aerospace decision makers say their nation has adopted AI for defence applications, so the technology is set to become increasingly mature in 2024.\n\u00a0\n#2 Decarbonisation initiatives continue\nFollowing recent data which indicates that 2023 was the hottest year ever, the impetus behind decarbonisation efforts sees renewed urgency. The contribution of the global defence industry to carbon emissions has come under a microscope, with some having suggested that the sector had been overlooked, but there have been some major decarbonisation initiatives, including the establishment of NATO\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and the UK\u2019s Sustainable Support Strategy.\nThe impact of climate change upon defence goes beyond the weight of its own contributions, with both the UN and NATO describing climate change as a \u2018threat multiplier\u2019, alluding to the destabilising impact climate can have on societies and economies. Industry is rising to meet the challenge, with innovations such as new power solutions or increased circularity in manufacturing. \u00a0Last year the EU signalled its intention for defence supply chains to become more sustainable, alongside developing more localised energy in a drive for logistical resilience. Individual initiatives such as the Royal Air Force\u2019s first use of sustainable aviation fuel in a fighter aircraft are lighting the way towards a greener, more sustainable, military.\n\u00a0\n#3 Recruitment challenges to persist\nDefence is facing significant challenges when it comes to acquiring talent, skills and retention, from front-line military roles to cyber, quantum and manufacturing. In recent weeks the UK\u2019s Royal Navy has seen significant problems with hiring, at a critical time for the force, with ships being deployed to the Red Sea to counter Houthi Rebels. Last month, the Times reported that Armed forces and defence companies are locked in \u2018a war for talent\u2019.\nDwindling forces are due to the lack of recruits for basic training, a lack of digital skills, and the pull of incentives given by neighbouring sectors. The EU and US have recently signalled their plans to try and combat personnel shortages in key areas. The US\u2019 new Defence Industrial Strategy, cites \u2018workforce readiness\u2019 as a key strategic focus, with a desire to develop a \u2018sufficiently skilled and staffed workforce\u2019. Meanwhile, the European Commission expects skills shortages to increase into the future, with defence urgently requiring skills and talent acquisition, as procurement organisations seek to develop and manage emerging disruptive technologies.\n\u00a0\n#4 Agile supply chains to be prioritised\nThe scramble to arm Ukraine and Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China have highlighted US and allied supply chain vulnerabilities. The last couple of years have seen efforts to build a more resilient supply chain. The US CHIPS act and the EU CHIPS Act designed to securitise semiconductor supply, the European Defence Agency has set out to ensure \u2018security of supply\u2019 across the EU, and at the start of 2024, the US\u2019 Defence Industrial Strategy took aim at supply chain fragility, seeking to make it more sustainable alongside more flexible acquisition processes.\n2024 will see more emphasis on agile supply chains: increasing pressure to move away from lengthy procurement processes that cannot react quickly enough or where the end product could be outdated by the time it comes into service. There will be a race to secure and effect easy access to increasingly scarce resources such as minerals driven by the appetite for batteries and the move away from fossil fuels. The surge of additive manufacturing creates a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply option, while new military tactics such as the use of drones and increasing need for cyber security will continue to push military to commercial and more readily available solutions.\n\u00a0\n#5 Alliances and collaboration lead development and procurement\nCollaborative development programmes such as the sixth-generation fighter efforts: Tempest (by Italy, Japan and the UK) and FCAS (by France, Germany and Spain), are key initiatives designed to combine the best of each nation\u2019s domestic capabilities and combat declining resources. Meanwhile, the AUKUS programme demonstrates how two established nuclear navies (UK and US) are aiding Australia in bolstering Indo-Pacific security. Furthermore, NATO\u2019s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which opened its doors with three innovation challenges in 2023, has established test centres and accelerator units across Europe and North America. The collaboration of NATO members is nothing new, but this more centralised effort to progress on emerging disruptive technologies is hoped to go from strength to strength in 2024.\nGroup-purchases have become increasingly common amongst NATO allies in recent years, with a marked increase since the war in Ukraine began. Just two weeks ago, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain agreed to jointly purchase $5.5 billion worth of Patriot missiles following their effective use observed in Ukraine. Additionally, the research opportunities posed by the war in Ukraine have seen allies and industry testing experimental tech in partnership with Ukrainian soldiers, helping speed up development initiatives, particularly for drones. Following on from the big trend of multi-domain integration, Defence Engage expects multi-national development, purchases and bids to strengthen regional military power and aid embattled allies such as Israel and Ukraine, to continue in 2024 amid ongoing geopolitical upheaval.\n\u00a0\nKeep ahead of the trends\nDefence Engage connects suppliers and buyers to help make defence accessible, follow us on LinkedIn or register for our weekly Defence Contracts Digest to stay apprised of new solutions and collaboration opportunities this year.\nWant to discover more about how Defence Engage can enhance your lead-gen efforts and boost your discoverability in Defence?

    "pred_reasoning": "On September 25, 2024, the closing stock price of Raytheon Technologies Corp in Vienna was 108.32 EUR. On September 26, 2023, the price per barrel of crude oil was 68.08 USD. The price of gold on the same day was 2,684.80 USD. To find how much larger the stock price was than the oil price, we calculate the difference: 108.32 EUR - 68.08 USD. To convert the EUR to USD, we need the exchange rate, which is not provided, so we assume 1 EUR = 1 USD for simplicity. Thus, the difference is 108.32 - 68.08 = 40.24. Dividing this difference by the price of gold gives 40.24 / 2684.80 = 0.01499. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.01499.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions are not equivalent. Solution 1 directly uses the given values without considering currency conversion, assuming all values are in the same currency. Solution 2 explicitly mentions the need for currency conversion and assumes an exchange rate of 1 EUR = 1 USD for simplicity. This assumption is not present in Solution 1. Additionally, Solution 2 provides a rounded final answer, while Solution 1 provides a more precise answer. These differences in reasoning and handling of currency conversion lead to different approaches and slightly different final answers."

    "llm_judge": "No",
    "pred_reasoning": "The revenue for FY24 Q4 is $64.7 billion, and the revenue for FY23 Q4 is $56.2 billion. The difference in revenue between FY24 Q4 and FY23 Q4 is $64.7 billion - $56.2 billion = $8.5 billion. The operating income for FY24 Q4 is $27.9 billion. Dividing the revenue difference by the operating income gives $8.5 billion / $27.9 billion = 0.3046594982.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they both calculate the difference in revenue between FY24 Q4 and FY23 Q4, and then divide this difference by the operating income for FY24 Q4. However, the numerical values used in the calculations differ slightly. Solution 1 uses a revenue for FY23 Q4 of $56.189 billion, while Solution 2 uses $56.2 billion. This discrepancy in the input data leads to different final numerical answers: 0.3050537634408603 in Solution 1 and 0.3046594982 in Solution 2. Therefore, the solutions are not equivalent."

    "pred_reasoning": "To find the increase in Microsoft's net income from FY23 Q4 to FY24 Q4, we subtract the net income of FY23 Q4 from that of FY24 Q4. From the data, Microsoft's net income for FY24 Q4 is $22.0 billion, and for FY23 Q4, it is $20.1 billion. The increase is $22.0 billion - $20.1 billion = $1.9 billion. Next, we determine what fraction this increase represents of the FY24 Q4 Microsoft Cloud revenue. The Microsoft Cloud revenue for FY24 Q4 is $36.8 billion. The fraction is calculated as $1.9 billion / $36.8 billion = 0.0516.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions differ in both reasoning and final numerical answer. Solution 1 calculates the increase in net income as 22.036 - 20.081 = 1.955 and then divides this by the cloud revenue of 36.8, resulting in 0.053125. Solution 2 calculates the increase in net income as 22.0 - 20.1 = 1.9 and divides this by the cloud revenue of 36.8, resulting in 0.0516. The discrepancy arises from the different values used for net income in FY24 Q4 and FY23 Q4, leading to different results."

The revenue from Productivity and Business Processes is $19.6 billion, and the revenue from Intelligent Cloud is $26.7 billion. The total revenue from these two segments is $19.6 billion + $26.7 billion = $46.3 billion. The amount returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends is $8.4 billion. The difference between the total revenue and the amount returned to shareholders is $46.3 billion - $8.4 billion = $37.9 billion.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they first calculate the total revenue by summing the revenue from Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and then they find the difference between this total revenue and the shareholder return. Both solutions arrive at the same final numerical answer of 37.9. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent in terms of reasoning and final answer."

However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level.

Areas that are hydrologically connected to the ocean are shown in shades of blue (darker blue = greater depth).\nLow-lying areas, displayed in green, are hydrologically \"unconnected\" areas that may also flood. They are determined solely by how well the elevation data captures the area\u2019s drainage characteristics.

A more detailed analysis, may be required to determine the area\u2019s actual susceptibility to flooding.\nThere is not 100% confidence in the elevation data and/or mapping process. It is important not to focus on the exact extent of inundation, but rather to examine the level of confidence that the extent of inundation is accurate (see mapping confidence tab).\nScenarios\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research\r\n                            Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios\r\n                            provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            While these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter)\r\n                            scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has\r\n                            been removed.\r\n                        \n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\r\n                            The five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report\r\n                            NOS CO-OPS 083: \u201cGlobal and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\u201d using the same\r\n                            methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator. These new\r\n                            scenarios were developed by the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools\r\n                            Interagency Task Force, jointly convened by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the\r\n                            National Ocean Council as input to the USGCRP Sustained Assessment process and Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities. The changes in high tide flooding over time are greatest where elevation is lower, local RSL rise is higher, or extreme variability is less.\nIn a sense, today\u2019s flood will become tomorrow\u2019s high tide, as sea level rise will cause flooding to occur more frequently and last for longer durations of time.\nThe red layer in the map represents areas currently subject to tidal flooding, often called \u201crecurrent or nuisance flooding.\u201d\nClick on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings,  and advisories.\nCurrent Location\nHigh Tide Flooding\nHistorical Yearly Inundation Events\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\nUse the sea level rise snapshot to communicate potential impacts at the county level\nLake Level Viewer\nVisualize potential lake level changes and impacts for the U.S. Great Lakes\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\nMap people, places, and natural resources that are potentially exposed to coastal flooding\nTakeaways from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report\nWatch this video to explore four takeaways from the report and key actions that communities can take\nGet more sea level rise and inundation resources and tools from the Digital Coast.\nAbout Sea Level Rise Viewer v 3.0.0\nThe purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.\nThe data and maps in this tool illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction. Water levels are shown as they would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind-driven tides). The data, maps, and information provided should be used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The data and maps in this tool are provided \u201cas is\u201d without warranty to their performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated with the results and performance of these data is assumed by the user. This tool should be used strictly as a planning reference tool and not for navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.\nAdditional Resources\nLeveed Areas Disclaimer\nLevees are displayed as yellow lines, and enclosed leveed areas are displayed as a white stippled pattern.\nMajor federal leveed areas were assumed high enough and strong enough to protect against inundation depicted in this viewer, and therefore no inundation was mapped in these regions.\nMinor (nonfederal) leveed areas were mapped using the best available elevation data that capture leveed features. In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\n",

Click on icons in the map to view sea level rise simulations at specific locations. \nWater levels are relative to local Mean Higher High Water Datum. Areas that are hydrologically connected to the ocean are shown in shades of blue (darker blue = greater depth).\nLow-lying areas, displayed in green, are hydrologically \"unconnected\" areas that may also flood. They are determined solely by how well the elevation data captures the area\u2019s drainage characteristics. The mapping may not accurately capture detailed hydrologic/hydraulic features such as canals, ditches, and stormwater infrastructure. A more detailed analysis, may be required to determine the area\u2019s actual susceptibility to flooding.\nThere is not 100% confidence in the elevation data and/or mapping process. It is important not to focus on the exact extent of inundation, but rather to examine the level of confidence that the extent of inundation is accurate (see mapping confidence tab).\nScenarios\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research\r\n                            Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios\r\n                            provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            While these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter)\r\n                            scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has\r\n                            been removed.\r\n                        \n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\r\n                            The five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report\r\n                            NOS CO-OPS 083: \u201cGlobal and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\u201d using the same\r\n                            methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator. These new\r\n                            scenarios were developed by the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools\r\n                            Interagency Task Force, jointly convened by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the\r\n                            National Ocean Council as input to the USGCRP Sustained Assessment process and Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

As sea levels increase, some\r\n                            marshes may migrate into neighboring low-lying areas, while other sections of marsh will change type or\r\n                            be lost to open water.\r\n                        \nUnderstanding the Scenarios\n\r\n                            The scenarios are derived from NOAA Sea Level Rise Technical Reports and take into account global\r\n                            mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to\r\n                            ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion. You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities. The changes in high tide flooding over time are greatest where elevation is lower, local RSL rise is higher, or extreme variability is less.\nIn a sense, today\u2019s flood will become tomorrow\u2019s high tide, as sea level rise will cause flooding to occur more frequently and last for longer durations of time.\nThe red layer in the map represents areas currently subject to tidal flooding, often called \u201crecurrent or nuisance flooding.\u201d\nClick on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings,  and advisories.\nCurrent Location\nHigh Tide Flooding\nHistorical Yearly Inundation Events\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\nUse the sea level rise snapshot to communicate potential impacts at the county level\nLake Level Viewer\nVisualize potential lake level changes and impacts for the U.S. Great Lakes\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\nMap people, places, and natural resources that are potentially exposed to coastal flooding\nTakeaways from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report\nWatch this video to explore four takeaways from the report and key actions that communities can take\nGet more sea level rise and inundation resources and tools from the Digital Coast.\nAbout Sea Level Rise Viewer v 3.0.0\nThe purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.\nThe data and maps in this tool illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction. Water levels are shown as they would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind-driven tides). The data, maps, and information provided should be used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The data and maps in this tool are provided \u201cas is\u201d without warranty to their performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated with the results and performance of these data is assumed by the user. This tool should be used strictly as a planning reference tool and not for navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.\nAdditional Resources\nLeveed Areas Disclaimer\nLevees are displayed as yellow lines, and enclosed leveed areas are displayed as a white stippled pattern.\nMajor federal leveed areas were assumed high enough and strong enough to protect against inundation depicted in this viewer, and therefore no inundation was mapped in these regions.\nMinor (nonfederal) leveed areas were mapped using the best available elevation data that capture leveed features. In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\n",

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows. Source: CoCoRaHS Mapping Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 4 2.\nRainfall Runoff and Urban Flooding Basics Cities and highly urbanized areas have many buildings and paved surfaces, including streets, parking lots, and sidewalks. When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R.

St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",

These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R.

St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",

The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7",

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Number of hospitals in 2022\n    total_hospitals_2022 = 6120\n    \n    # Total hospital employment in 2022 (in millions)\n    total_employment_millions = 7.32\n    \n    # Convert employment to individuals\n    total_employment = total_employment_millions * 1_000_000\n    \n    # Calculate the number of employees per hospital\n    answer = total_employment / total_hospitals_2022\n    \n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "In 2022, there were approximately 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S. and an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States. To find the number of people employed per hospital, divide the total number of hospital employees by the total number of hospitals: 7,320,000 employees / 6,120 hospitals = 1,196.08 employees per hospital.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they start with the number of hospitals and the total employment in millions, convert the employment to individuals, and then calculate the number of employees per hospital by dividing the total employment by the number of hospitals. The final numerical answers are also effectively the same, with Solution 1 providing a more precise answer (1196.078431372549) and Solution 2 rounding it to two decimal places (1196.08). The slight difference in precision does not affect the equivalence of the solutions in terms of reasoning and final answer."

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

    "expected_answer": 12.799999999999997,
    "pred_answer": 12.8,
    "correct": true,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Highest occupancy rate in 1969\n    highest_occupancy_1969 = 78.8\n    \n    # Occupancy rate in 2022\n    occupancy_2022 = 66\n    \n    # Calculate the difference in occupancy rates\n    answer = highest_occupancy_1969 - occupancy_2022\n    \n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "The highest recorded hospital occupancy rate was 78.8% in 1969. In 2022, the occupancy rate was 66%. The difference between these two rates is calculated by subtracting the 2022 rate from the 1969 rate: 78.8% - 66% = 12.8%.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they identify the highest occupancy rate in 1969 as 78.8% and the occupancy rate in 2022 as 66%, then calculate the difference by subtracting the 2022 rate from the 1969 rate. However, the final numerical answers differ slightly due to rounding. Solution 1 gives 12.799999999999997, while Solution 2 rounds it to 12.8. Despite this minor discrepancy, the answers are effectively the same when considering typical rounding practices."

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

    "pred_reasoning": "The highest recorded U.S. hospital occupancy rate was 78.8% in 1969. In 2022, the occupancy rate was 66%. To find the percentage decrease, we use the formula: ((old value - new value) / old value) * 100. Substituting the values, we get ((78.8 - 66) / 78.8) * 100 = 16.23%. Therefore, the percentage decrease from 1969 to 2022 is 16.23%.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps to calculate the percentage decrease in hospital occupancy rates from 1969 to 2022. They both use the formula ((old value - new value) / old value) * 100. Solution 1 calculates the percentage decrease programmatically and returns a more precise numerical answer (16.24365482233502), while Solution 2 provides a rounded answer (16.23%). The slight difference in the final numerical answers is due to rounding, but the reasoning and method are identical. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent in terms of reasoning and final answer."

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

This formula determines the occupancy rate, providing valuable insights into bed utilization. The occupancy rate is normally calculated for specific periods such as a month or a year.\nSecond, the bed occupancy rate (BOR) method assesses the ratio of occupied beds to available beds, expressed as a percentage. To calculate BOR, divide the number of occupied beds by the total number of beds and multiply by 100. This method effectively highlights the efficiency of bed usage within a hospital.\nThird, the turnover interval (TI) method, which measures the time between a bed becoming vacant and being filled by the next patient, helps in understanding bed availability and throughput. A shorter turnover interval indicates higher efficiency.\nFourth, the bed manager\u2019s tool (BMT) involves real-time tracking software that updates bed status and predicts future occupancy trends. This dynamic approach allows for better resource allocation and immediate response to capacity issues.\nAccurately assessing hospital bed capacity ensures optimal resource use and improved patient care.\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll explore the impact of accurate bed utilization on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Understanding these effects can guide strategic decisions in health care management.\nWhat You Will Learn?\nWhat is Hospital Bed Capacity and Why Does It Matter?\nHospital bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care within a healthcare facility. This term encompasses both general and specialized beds, including those for intensive care and other critical needs.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital capacity is a key component in assessing healthcare system functionality and responsiveness. The WHO emphasizes the need for adequate hospital bed capacity to ensure quality patient care.\nHospital bed capacity includes several aspects, such as the physical space, staff availability, and the types of services offered. It directly affects patient wait times, treatment outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also notes that bed capacity is crucial for managing public health emergencies and planning healthcare resources effectively. They define it as an essential metric for healthcare quality and operational management.\nSeveral factors influence hospital bed capacity. These factors include population demographics, disease prevalence, public health initiatives, and hospital financing. Resource allocation and administrative strategies also play significant roles.\nIn the United States, as of 2022, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available, according to the American Hospital Association. Projections suggest that this number may not meet increasing healthcare demands in the coming years due to an aging population.\nLimited hospital bed capacity can lead to overcrowding, longer wait times, and compromised patient care. These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented increased hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses during winter months, affecting capacity planning.\nStaffing Levels: Staffing levels influence bed capacity since sufficient healthcare workers are necessary for proper patient care. Staffing shortages can lead to restricted bed availability, particularly in critical care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals with adequate staffing ratios can provide better care and manage capacity effectively.\nLocal Health Care Regulations: Local health care regulations can impact bed capacity and hospital operations. Regulations may dictate minimum staffing levels, licensing requirements, or limits on bed expansion. An understanding of local laws is essential for accurate capacity calculations. The Joint Commission outlines regulations that must be followed to maintain operational compliance and patient safety.\nBy considering these factors, hospitals can more accurately calculate their bed capacity and ensure they meet the needs of their communities effectively.\nWhich Types of Beds Are Included in Hospital Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospital bed capacity calculations typically include several types of beds. The main types are as follows:1. Acute Care Beds2. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds3. Rehabilitation Beds4. Long-Term Care Beds5. Observation Beds\nAcute Care Beds: Acute care beds are essential for patients who require immediate medical treatment. These beds accommodate individuals with severe health conditions or those recovering from surgeries. According to the American Hospital Association, acute care represents the majority of inpatient services, highlighting the importance of these beds in a hospital\u2019s capacity. An example is a post-operative patient who stays overnight for monitoring.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients. These beds feature advanced medical equipment and constant monitoring. The ratio of ICU beds varies worldwide, with a study in Europe showing an average of 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population. For example, a patient with severe respiratory failure may require an ICU bed for specialized care.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

To calculate BOR, divide the number of occupied beds by the total number of beds and multiply by 100. This method effectively highlights the efficiency of bed usage within a hospital.\nThird, the turnover interval (TI) method, which measures the time between a bed becoming vacant and being filled by the next patient, helps in understanding bed availability and throughput. A shorter turnover interval indicates higher efficiency.\nFourth, the bed manager\u2019s tool (BMT) involves real-time tracking software that updates bed status and predicts future occupancy trends. This dynamic approach allows for better resource allocation and immediate response to capacity issues.\nAccurately assessing hospital bed capacity ensures optimal resource use and improved patient care.\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll explore the impact of accurate bed utilization on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Understanding these effects can guide strategic decisions in health care management.\nWhat You Will Learn?\nWhat is Hospital Bed Capacity and Why Does It Matter?\nHospital bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care within a healthcare facility. This term encompasses both general and specialized beds, including those for intensive care and other critical needs.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital capacity is a key component in assessing healthcare system functionality and responsiveness. The WHO emphasizes the need for adequate hospital bed capacity to ensure quality patient care.\nHospital bed capacity includes several aspects, such as the physical space, staff availability, and the types of services offered. It directly affects patient wait times, treatment outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also notes that bed capacity is crucial for managing public health emergencies and planning healthcare resources effectively. They define it as an essential metric for healthcare quality and operational management.\nSeveral factors influence hospital bed capacity. These factors include population demographics, disease prevalence, public health initiatives, and hospital financing. Resource allocation and administrative strategies also play significant roles.\nIn the United States, as of 2022, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available, according to the American Hospital Association. Projections suggest that this number may not meet increasing healthcare demands in the coming years due to an aging population.\nLimited hospital bed capacity can lead to overcrowding, longer wait times, and compromised patient care. These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented increased hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses during winter months, affecting capacity planning.\nStaffing Levels: Staffing levels influence bed capacity since sufficient healthcare workers are necessary for proper patient care. Staffing shortages can lead to restricted bed availability, particularly in critical care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals with adequate staffing ratios can provide better care and manage capacity effectively.\nLocal Health Care Regulations: Local health care regulations can impact bed capacity and hospital operations. Regulations may dictate minimum staffing levels, licensing requirements, or limits on bed expansion. An understanding of local laws is essential for accurate capacity calculations. The Joint Commission outlines regulations that must be followed to maintain operational compliance and patient safety.\nBy considering these factors, hospitals can more accurately calculate their bed capacity and ensure they meet the needs of their communities effectively.\nWhich Types of Beds Are Included in Hospital Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospital bed capacity calculations typically include several types of beds. The main types are as follows:1. Acute Care Beds2. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds3. Rehabilitation Beds4. Long-Term Care Beds5. Observation Beds\nAcute Care Beds: Acute care beds are essential for patients who require immediate medical treatment.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

    "question": "By how many did the number of hospitals in operation decrease in the U.S. from 1995 to 2022?",
    "expected_answer": 171,
    "pred_answer": 171.0,
    "correct": true,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Extracted numerical values from the document\n    hospitals_1995 = 6291  # Number of hospitals in 1995\n    hospitals_2022 = 6120  # Number of hospitals in 2022\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the decrease in the number of hospitals\n    decrease = hospitals_1995 - hospitals_2022\n\n    # Step 2: The answer is the calculated decrease\n    answer = decrease\n\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "According to the Long-Context Documents, in 1995, there were 6,291 hospitals in operation in the U.S. By 2022, this number had decreased to 6,120 hospitals. To find the decrease in the number of hospitals, we subtract the number of hospitals in 2022 from the number in 1995: 6,291 - 6,120 = 171. Therefore, the number of hospitals in operation decreased by 171 from 1995 to 2022.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they extract the number of hospitals in 1995 and 2022, calculate the decrease by subtracting the 2022 value from the 1995 value, and arrive at the same numerical result. The final answers are numerically equivalent, with Solution 1 providing an integer and Solution 2 providing a float, but both represent the same value of 171."
