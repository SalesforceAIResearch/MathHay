During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.

The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) both also affect agricultural output and both also show sensitivity to climate variability and change3,4,5,6,7,8,9. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts to agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield, but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nWarming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields\n                                        \n\n\nImpacts of recent climate change on crop yield can depend on local conditions in climatically diverse regions of Norway\n                                        \n\n\nContrasting area and yield responses to extreme climate contributes to climate-resilient rice production in Asia\n                                        \n\nReferences\nRosenzweig, C. et al.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The sensitivity of agricultural output to climate change has often been estimated by modeling crop yields under climate change scenarios or with statistical analysis of the impacts of year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields. However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) also affect agricultural output and show sensitivity to climate variability and change. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency, and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses, and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts on agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4. Difference from average Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) for the state of Kansas during the February 12-26, 2024 period as compared to the long-term average. Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4. Difference from average Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) for the state of Kansas during the February 12-26, 2024 period as compared to the long-term average. Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology.

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

And it's picked up the pace in recent years.\nIn the last 80 years, sea level rise has risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that total in the last 30 years, said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's best estimates, that pace is expected to speed up\u2014dramatically.\nIt took about 80 years for the first foot. The second one will only take 30 years. The next, 20 years. And Florida could see the next foot in merely a decade after that.\n\"Sea level rise is beginning to speed up a bit,\" McNoldy said. \"If you draw a straight line it starts to not look so straight in recent decades.\"\nThat's according to NOAA's \"intermediate-high\" projection of sea level rise. The agency created a range of predictions\u2014low, intermediate-low, intermediate, intermediate-high and high\u2014to estimate what sea level rise could look like in places like Florida.\nSo far, scientists have found that we're trending toward the high end of those predictions.\n\"Presently, sea level is tracking in the intermediate-high to high, the two fastest,\" said Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist with Florida International University. \"The other three scenarios, you might not even think about because we're already rising faster than that.\"\nThose are the same predictions used by South Florida governments when deciding how high to build new developments. But after a new bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year, local governments hoping for state money for sea rise projects have to only consider the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios, a downgrade from previous legislation that asked them to consider intermediate-low and intermediate-high scenarios.\nWhat goes into a sea rise projection?\nTwo feet of sea rise by 2060, compared to present-day levels, would be a shock to the system for Miami, where the average elevation is three feet. That's why local governments\u2014and the state\u2014are spending billions to keep streets dry.\nHowever, pinning down exactly how much sea rise South Florida could experience is a tough task.\nResearchers know the two main factors in sea level rise are the temperature of the ocean and how much the ice sheets melt. As burned fossil fuels trap more heat in the atmosphere, that heat is largely being absorbed by the ocean. Hotter water physically takes up more space than cold water, so a hotter ocean means higher sea levels. A hotter atmosphere also means gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, pouring tremendous amounts of now-liquid water into the sea.\nThose two issues make up the lion's share of impact to rising sea levels, but South Florida also has its own unique challenges that add to rising water levels.\nThere's the fact that some parts of the land are actually sinking, a process known as subsidence. However, it's not very much\u2014the depth of two credit cards stacked on top of each other over half a decade in one spot in Miami Beach.\n\"It does add to an already dire situation, but it isn't a driving force,\" Parkinson said.\nThe one big unknown in South Florida's future of sea level rise is likely the water rushing offshore. The Gulf Stream, a massive current that moves hot water from the tropics to the frigid depths of the Arctic, has a little offshoot that runs between Florida's east coast and the Bahamas.\nThe Florida Current, as it's known, has an impact on Miami's water levels. When the current is stronger, water levels are generally a bit lower in Miami. And when it's weaker, they have been shown to rise.\nA new paper from Lisa Beal, professor of ocean sciences at UM's Rosenstiel School, and Chris Piecuch, a physical oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, found for the first time that this current may be slowing down.\n\"We found that there is a weakening. It's small,\" she said.\nThe article, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in September, suggested that the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% in the last 40 years, although it did not directly link that change to global warming.\nBeal said the findings were significant for Florida.\n\"We shouldn't get carried away that weakening of the Gulf Stream is going to double sea level rise in Miami. It isn't,\" she said. However, \"when you're so low-lying like South Florida, you'd kind of want to know because it means you reach thresholds of flooding much more quickly.\"\nBut perhaps the biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise boils down to one thing: exactly how much more pollution the world will continue to spew into the atmosphere. The lower-end predictions account for a world in which governments stop burning fossil fuels quickly, and the higher-end predictions are based on a situation where we burn even more than we are now.\n\"One of the great unknowns is, the world needs to be attempting to slow down the release of greenhouse gases,\" McNoldy said.\n\nJournal information:\nGeophysical Research Letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  2024 Miami Herald.

    "Document2": "The Maldives is racing to create new land. Why are so many people concerned?\nBy Jesse Chase-Lubitz\nPhotography by Neeta Satam for Nature\n24 April 2024\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSun, sand and sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those are the three ingredients for tourism in the Maldives, Mohamed Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father told him. For more than a decade, Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family owned a successful local hotel in Addu, the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 southernmost atoll. But nearly 9\u00a0months ago, the government took away the sea.\nA state-sponsored project had pulled up sediment from offshore areas and used it to extend the beach in front of the hotel by 130\u00a0metres\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 too far to walk for most tourists who want easy access to the ocean. Now all Shaiz sees from his hotel is a human-made desert and a slew of cancelled reservations.\nThe view in front of Mohamed Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel on Addu Atoll.\nThe Maldives is an 820-kilometre-long chain of nearly 1,200 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. The nation has become one of the most popular luxury tourism destinations in the world because of its Instagrammable beaches and its advertising slogan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe sunny side of life\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But the Maldives is also one of the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. With 80% of its land less than one metre above sea level, some scientists predict that the islands could be completely submerged by 2100.\nIn an effort to keep the country above water and thriving, the government is adopting a strategy used by many nations around the globe: land reclamation. The sandy stretch in front of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel is some of the newest land on the planet, dug up from the bottom of the ocean, sucked through pipes and piled along the coast to make more space.\nMaldivian government officials say that the land is necessary to make room for economic development, especially as sea levels rise.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will be a doorstep, a job destination and an income-generating destination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said President Mohamed Muizzu at the inauguration of a new land-reclamation project last December.\nCritics are unconvinced, and say that the country has enough space to thrive. One swathe of land on a neighbouring island near Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel was reclaimed in 2016. It remains undeveloped today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCall me in five years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shaiz says, gesturing to the newly created desert in front of his hotel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis land will be the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMohamed Shaiz and his family own a hotel on Addu Atoll.\nMohamed Shaiz and his family own a hotel on Addu Atoll.\nIn addition to the disputed economics, there is serious concern about the environmental damage that land reclamation can cause. Studies in the Maldives and at other sites around the world have shown that it can harm corals and seagrass, damage natural barriers, such as sand bars, mangroves and estuaries, and destroy marine habitats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAtolls are extremely vulnerable ecosystems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Bregje van Wesenbeeck, the scientific director of Deltares, a Dutch research institute for water management in Delft. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce you start to interfere with them, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sort of failing them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll.\nThe island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll.\nDutch planners are often considered the founders of land reclamation, with a history of water engineering going back some 800\u00a0years. Over the centuries, land-forming projects have shaped some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major cities, including Singapore, London, New York and Miami. In recent decades, most of the reclaimed land has been in East Asia. In China, Shanghai has reclaimed 350\u00a0square kilometres \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than three times the size of Paris\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 over the past few decades. Colombo has added 100\u00a0km2 in just 4\u00a0years, and 65\u00a0km2 of Mumbai is reclaimed. A study on twenty-first-century coastal-land reclamation found that of 135 large coastal cities with populations of more than one\u00a0million people, 75%\u00a0had reclaimed land1.\nWith projects stretching back to 1997, the Maldives is a veteran of large-scale land reclamation. Then-minister of state for environment Abdulla Naseer said in 2018 that there are an estimated 50\u00a0islands with reclaimed land in the country, although many specialists say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a conservative estimate.\nSource: Maldives Land and Survey Authority\nSource: Maldives Land and Survey Authority\nLand scarcity is a key factor driving reclamation projects. Although the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territory covers 90,000\u00a0km2, more than 99% of it is ocean. Around half a million people live on a total land area of just 300\u00a0km2, and the country welcomes around 1.3\u00a0million tourists each year, who contribute 80% of its gross domestic product. The capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9, is one of the most densely populated parts of the planet. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to walk across the entire island in 20\u00a0minutes.\nImages captured by LANDSAT satellites in 1997 and 2020 show the impact of reclamation projects on Mal\u00c3\u00a9 and nearby islands.\nCredit: Lauren Dauphin/NASA Earth Observatory\nThe Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1,200\u00a0islands are all atolls\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 rings of coral reef that surround lagoons. When the government decides to reclaim land, it takes sand from the lagoons using boats outfitted with suction pipes, which collect sand and coral debris from the ocean floor like giant vacuum cleaners. The boat then deposits the material in a different spot, either inside or outside the atoll, to form new land. Sometimes reclamation projects fill in the entire lagoon.\nHeaps of sand and debris are piled up next to Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel and behind the new patch of reclaimed land.\nHeaps of sand and debris are piled up next to Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel and behind the new patch of reclaimed land.\nAddu Atoll, the site of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, is about two hours south of Mal\u00c3\u00a9 by aeroplane. Its rich coral reefs support more than 1,200\u00a0species of fish\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the factors that led the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO to include the atoll in its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2020.\nSome of the islands are so narrow that you can almost always see water on both sides while standing in the centre. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a largely quiet and rural place that feels forgotten. Yet construction marches on.\nThe Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure announced the Addu Development Project in 2021, aiming to reclaim parts of the atoll and develop a road connection between existing islands. One of the ministry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s justifications is that it will provide extra housing. In the Maldives, land for houses is given away to eligible individuals and families. Addu City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, Ali Nizar, says that there have been more than 5,000\u00a0requests for housing since he entered office in 2021. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no other way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nA reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts.\nA reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts.\nBecause Addu has one of the few international airports in the country, the hope is also that the extra land will attract international investment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this huge expansion project, the transformational development of Addu City has commenced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said former president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih after inaugurating the project in June 2023.\nThe project has been controversial from the start. When it was announced, Ibrahim Mohamed was sitting at his desk at the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Mal\u00c3\u00a9. He instantly had concerns about how the project would affect Addu. Mohamed grew up in Addu in the 1970s, taking walks through the massive seagrass beds near his home. He remembers watching stingrays surf the waves, and marvelling at fiddler crabs along the shore.\nMohamed led the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for land-reclamation projects. When the Addu proposal landed on his desk, he contracted an environmental consulting group called Water Solutions, headquarted in Mal\u00c3\u00a9, to do the review.\nThe environmental impact report, published in February 2022, found that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe proposed reclamation is well received by the community\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh interest to implement the project based on the potential economic benefits\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But it also concluded that \u00e2\u0080\u009clong-term irreversible negative impacts will be generated from the project\u00e2\u0080\u009d for both the environment and the community, including by destroying coral reefs and seagrass meadows and harming the fishing and tourism industries.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was sufficient enough for the EPA to reject the project,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mohamed says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In May 2022, he quit his job after 10\u00a0years at the agency.\nAfter the report came out, the EPA pushed for changes, such as a smaller area from which the project would source sand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe tried to change the scope because we are here to protect the environment and at the same time, help development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director-general, Ibrahim Naeem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDevelopment has to go hand in hand with environment. It should not destroy the environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nOnce the changes were made to the proposed project, Water Solutions produced a second report to assess the environmental impacts at the end of September 2022. It found that the altered project, with increased mitigation and monitoring in place, would still have irreversible negative impacts\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 ranging from moderate to major\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 on marine plants and animals, protected and sensitive areas, tourism, fisheries and recreational activities.\nThe assessment calculated that the cost of the damage to coral reefs alone would be between US$340\u00a0million and $851\u00a0million.\nThe September 2022 report does not offer explicit recommendations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur role is to share the information. We just wanted to present the facts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Ahmed Jameel, managing director of Water Solutions and one of the authors of the report. However, he adds, the assessment was not vague in its conclusions. The findings showed clearly that the project \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould have an overall negative impact\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he says.\nWhen asked about the concerns raised in the second report, Naeem says that the findings, combined with insights he received from EPA staff members who conducted anonymous reviews of the EIA, indicated that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cenough justification in the report to approve it in terms of social benefit\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny development projects in this type of environment, especially in the marine area, will have an impact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you do reclamation properly, and if you do it wisely, I think impacts can be minimized\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nIbrahim Mohamed previously worked for the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency.\nIbrahim Mohamed previously worked for the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe construction company Van Oord is performing the reclamation work for the Addu Atoll project.\nThe construction company Van Oord is performing the reclamation work for the Addu Atoll project.\nThe Dutch company responsible for doing the construction on the project, Van Oord, told Nature that environmental management for the project is overseen by the EPA and that it is working with the agency and local specialists to minimize the environmental impacts. Van Oord said it prepared a comprehensive environmental management plan \u00e2\u0080\u009cbased on the mitigation measures mandated in the EIA and in compliance with international guidelines\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As part of its efforts, the company relocated coral and seagrass, and added silt screens to limit how much sediment would flow beyond the reclamation zone and affect other areas.\nVan Oord, which is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told Nature that \u00e2\u0080\u009call the predicted impacts have been effectively managed by implementing a series of mitigation measures\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nA new house on Hulhumeedhoo island, to the northeast of Addu City, remains unfinished and unoccupied.\nA new house on Hulhumeedhoo island, to the northeast of Addu City, remains unfinished and unoccupied.\nIn October 2022, the EPA approved the project. But critics say the environmental costs of the reclamation are too high.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think their efforts are not worth the amount of destruction and the irreversible damage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mohamed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can never be compensated properly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nToday, the land in front of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel is the result of that decision. Yet if you speak to people on Addu, many say that land is not what they need right now; they need jobs. Much of Addu is filled with empty, unfinished homes because individuals don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the income or resources to build houses on their free land.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty per cent [of our land] is abandoned or empty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Addu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former deputy mayor, Abdullah Thoyyib, who served the city before this reclamation project took place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need economic benefits and job opportunities, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nReefs at risk\nReclamation projects in the Maldives can fill the water with sediment, threatening coral reefs.\nReclamation projects in the Maldives can fill the water with sediment, threatening coral reefs.\nSitting in a resort in Addu City, Nisal Musthag places a map of Addu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main diving spots on the table. Musthag leads diving trips for one of the two active resorts in the atoll, and he has seen some of the damage that follows reclamation projects. He points at one of the four channels between the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagoon and the ocean. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is like a cemetery now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nMusthag does three to four dives a day, six days a week. Since the most-recent reclamation, there are at least five sites he no longer takes guests to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are people who come back every year to dive, and this year they were like, hey, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNisal Musthag leads diving trips in Addu, but has stopped taking tourists to spots where coral was damaged by reclamation projects.\nThe impacts of reclamation on coral health are one of researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 main concerns. Some reefs die when sediment is dumped on them to create new land. But even corals that escape direct damage can be harmed because the construction work creates clouds of sediment that spread out and settle on more distant reefs. Robbed of light and nutrients, these corals can struggle to survive. The damage to reefs not only harms the ecosystem but can also leave the islands vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise, say scientists.\nTo reduce damage to corals during the work at Addu, the EIA required that at least 10% of existing corals be relocated outside the reclamation footprints. Van Oord says it has moved 73,000\u00a0corals to 9\u00a0recipient sites identified in conjunction with the EPA. The firm says that it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly surpassed the EIA requirement\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nSaleem Rasheed is one of several local divers who helped to relocate the corals. He has been monitoring them for the past year. One species, blue coral (Heliopora coerulea), which was moved from the outside of the atoll to the inside, died completely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe moved 80\u00a0colonies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Rasheed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey survived one week and died entirely after six months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAli Nizar, Addu City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, supports the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reclamation projects.\nFathimath Saaira, social-justice advocate in Addu. \nFathimath Saaira, social-justice advocate in Addu. \nFathimath Saaira is a social-justice advocate in Addu who opposes the reclamation there.\nBut the rest of the species have shown resilience. Three months after relocation, they were struggling, but now, Rasheed says, they are alive and well.\nResearchers have found that coral relocation can work if colonies are moved to areas with similar conditions that are protected from waves. A 2017 study in Hawaii, for example, showed that relocated corals were thriving a decade after they were moved2. One study on coral restoration and relocation in the Maldives measured the survival rate of 242\u00a0coral fragments 12\u00a0months after they had been moved3. The authors found a 70% survival rate, which they concluded was a promising result. \nA solitary mangrove tree grows near newly reclaimed land in northeast Addu.\nA grey heron joins others on a new sea wall built in Addu.\nBut coral health is only one concern for researchers studying the effects of reclamation. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coastal ecosystems can also be in harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, say scientists.\nWater Solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 second report about the Addu project, for example, projected that the reclamation process would bury about 98\u00a0hectares of seagrass meadow in the atoll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagoon, at an estimated economic cost of more than $3.7\u00a0million a year.\nCoral debris makes up much of the reclaimed land.\nCoral debris makes up much of the reclaimed land.\nNot far from Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, a sea wall stretches towards the horizon, protecting a new swathe of land made of sand and coral debris. Coastal protection efforts such as the sea wall\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the changes wrought by reclamation\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 could have long-lasting effects on the processes that keep the islands from eroding, say researchers.\nLike other atolls, the Maldivian islands evolve with the seasons, with monsoons moving sand around them. Between December and February, the winds transport sand from the northeast to the southwest. Between June and August, the pattern reverses.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a natural island, you will see seasonally the sand shifting with the waves and the currents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mohamed. But reclamation can impede this process, he adds, by taking sand and coral debris from some locations through dredging\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 leaving a deficit in its wake\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and depositing it where natural flows wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Some projects add another complication by building hard barriers, such as sea walls, to protect the land, because they can stop the natural flow of sediments.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEcosystems can adapt if we allow them to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says van Wesenbeeck at Deltares. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy interfering, you will kill the whole system in the end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNot only does this change how the island naturally maintains itself, but it can also draw development to places that are at a high risk of a storm surge or erosion, say some researchers.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIslands can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t occur anywhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Virginie Duvat, a coastal geographer at La Rochelle University in France, who has studied the effects of land reclamation in the Maldives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you put an island where there was naturally no island, you create vulnerable land and you will necessarily have to build strong engineered structures, breakwaters and sea walls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says.\nA reclamation projection near Mal\u00c3\u00a9.\nThilafushi is an industrial island near Mal\u00c3\u00a9 that hosts one of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large rubbish dumps.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Sea levels are rising faster in South Florida, impacting roads and homes. Over the past 80 years, sea levels have risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that rise occurring in the last 30 years, according to Brian McNoldy from the University of Miami. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts this pace will accelerate, with the next foot of rise expected in just 30 years, then 20 years, and possibly a decade after that. Currently, sea levels are tracking towards NOAA's intermediate-high to high projections, the fastest scenarios. Local governments in South Florida use these projections to plan new developments, although recent legislation now requires them to consider only the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios for state-funded projects. The main factors driving sea level rise are ocean temperature and ice sheet melt. As fossil fuels trap more heat, the ocean absorbs it, causing water to expand and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, adding more water to the sea. South Florida also faces land subsidence, though it's minimal. The Florida Current, part of the Gulf Stream, affects Miami's water levels; a weaker current can lead to higher sea levels. A study by Lisa Beal and Chris Piecuch found the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% over the last 40 years. The biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise is the amount of pollution the world will continue to emit. Lower-end predictions assume a rapid reduction in fossil fuel use, while higher-end predictions assume continued or increased emissions.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "\u201cSun, sand and sea.\u201d Those are the three ingredients for tourism in the Maldives, Mohamed Shaiz\u2019s father told him. For more than a decade, Shaiz\u2019s family owned a successful local hotel in Addu, the Maldives\u2019 southernmost atoll. But nearly 9 months ago, the government took away the sea. A state-sponsored project had pulled up sediment from offshore areas and used it to extend the beach in front of the hotel by 130 metres \u2014 too far to walk for most tourists who want easy access to the ocean. Now all Shaiz sees from his hotel is a human-made desert and a slew of cancelled reservations. The Maldives is an 820-kilometre-long chain of nearly 1,200 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. The nation has become one of the most popular luxury tourism destinations in the world because of its Instagrammable beaches and its advertising slogan: \u201cthe sunny side of life\u201d. But the Maldives is also one of the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. With 80% of its land less than one metre above sea level, some scientists predict that the islands could be completely submerged by 2100. In an effort to keep the country above water and thriving, the government is adopting a strategy used by many nations around the globe: land reclamation. The sandy stretch in front of Shaiz\u2019s hotel is some of the newest land on the planet, dug up from the bottom of the ocean, sucked through pipes and piled along the coast to make more space. Maldivian government officials say that the land is necessary to make room for economic development, especially as sea levels rise. Critics are unconvinced, and say that the country has enough space to thrive. One swathe of land on a neighbouring island near Shaiz\u2019s hotel was reclaimed in 2016. It remains undeveloped today. In addition to the disputed economics, there is serious concern about the environmental damage that land reclamation can cause. Studies in the Maldives and at other sites around the world have shown that it can harm corals and seagrass, damage natural barriers, such as sand bars, mangroves and estuaries, and destroy marine habitats. The island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00e9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll. Dutch planners are often considered the founders of land reclamation, with a history of water engineering going back some 800 years. Over the centuries, land-forming projects have shaped some of the world\u2019s major cities, including Singapore, London, New York and Miami. In recent decades, most of the reclaimed land has been in East Asia. In China, Shanghai has reclaimed 350 square kilometres \u2014 more than three times the size of Paris \u2014 over the past few decades. Colombo has added 100 km2 in just 4 years, and 65 km2 of Mumbai is reclaimed. A study on twenty-first-century coastal-land reclamation found that of 135 large coastal cities with populations of more than one million people, 75% had reclaimed land. With projects stretching back to 1997, the Maldives is a veteran of large-scale land reclamation. Then-minister of state for environment Abdulla Naseer said in 2018 that there are an estimated 50 islands with reclaimed land in the country, although many specialists say that\u2019s a conservative estimate. Land scarcity is a key factor driving reclamation projects. Although the nation\u2019s territory covers 90,000 km2, more than 99% of it is ocean. Around half a million people live on a total land area of just 300 km2, and the country welcomes around 1.3 million tourists each year, who contribute 80% of its gross domestic product. The capital, Mal\u00e9, is one of the most densely populated parts of the planet. It\u2019s possible to walk across the entire island in 20 minutes. The Maldives\u2019 1,200 islands are all atolls \u2014 rings of coral reef that surround lagoons. When the government decides to reclaim land, it takes sand from the lagoons using boats outfitted with suction pipes, which collect sand and coral debris from the ocean floor like giant vacuum cleaners. The boat then deposits the material in a different spot, either inside or outside the atoll, to form new land. Sometimes reclamation projects fill in the entire lagoon. Addu Atoll, the site of Shaiz\u2019s hotel, is about two hours south of Mal\u00e9 by aeroplane. Its rich coral reefs support more than 1,200 species of fish \u2014 one of the factors that led the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO to include the atoll in its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2020. Some of the islands are so narrow that you can almost always see water on both sides while standing in the centre. It\u2019s a largely quiet and rural place that feels forgotten. Yet construction marches on. The Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure announced the Addu Development Project in 2021, aiming to reclaim parts of the atoll and develop a road connection between existing islands. One of the ministry\u2019s justifications is that it will provide extra housing. In the Maldives, land for houses is given away to eligible individuals and families. Addu City\u2019s mayor, Ali Nizar, says that there have been more than 5,000 requests for housing since he entered office in 2021. A reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts. Because Addu has one of the few international airports in the country, the hope is also that the extra land will attract international investment. The project has been controversial from the start. When it was announced, Ibrahim Mohamed was sitting at his desk at the Maldives\u2019 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Mal\u00e9. He instantly had concerns about how the project would affect Addu. Mohamed grew up in Addu in the 1970s, taking walks through the massive seagrass beds near his home. He remembers watching stingrays surf the waves, and marvelling at fiddler crabs along the shore. Mohamed led the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for land-reclamation projects. When the Addu proposal landed on his desk, he contracted an environmental consulting group called Water Solutions, headquarted in Mal\u00e9, to do the review. The environmental impact report, published in February 2022, found that \u201cthe proposed reclamation is well received by the community\u201d and that there was \u201chigh interest to implement the project based on the potential economic benefits\u201d. But it also concluded that \u201clong-term irreversible negative impacts will be generated from the project\u201d for both the environment and the community, including by destroying coral reefs and seagrass meadows and harming the fishing and tourism industries. \u201cIt was sufficient enough for the EPA to reject the project,\u201d Mohamed says. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t.\u201d In May 2022, he quit his job after 10 years at the agency. After the report came out, the EPA pushed for changes, such as a smaller area from which the project would source sand. \u201cWe tried to change the scope because we are here to protect the environment and at the same time, help development,\u201d says the agency\u2019s director-general, Ibrahim Naeem. \u201cDevelopment has to go hand in hand with environment. It should not destroy the environment,\u201d he says. Once the changes were made to the proposed project, Water Solutions produced a second report to assess the environmental impacts at the end of September 2022. It found that the altered project, with increased mitigation and monitoring in place, would still have irreversible negative impacts \u2014 ranging from moderate to major \u2014 on marine plants and animals, protected and sensitive areas, tourism, fisheries and recreational activities. The assessment calculated that the cost of the damage to coral reefs alone would be between US$340 million and $851 million. The September 2022 report does not offer explicit recommendations. \u201cOur role is to share the information. We just wanted to present the facts,\u201d says Ahmed Jameel, managing director of Water Solutions and one of the authors of the report. However, he adds, the assessment was not vague in its conclusions. The findings showed clearly that the project \u201cwould have an overall negative impact\u201d, he says. When asked about the concerns raised in the second report, Naeem says that the findings, combined with insights he received from EPA staff members who conducted anonymous reviews of the EIA, indicated that there was \u201cenough justification in the report to approve it in terms of social benefit\u201d. \u201cAny development projects in this type of environment, especially in the marine area, will have an impact,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cif you do reclamation properly, and if you do it wisely, I think impacts can be minimized\u201d. The Dutch company responsible for doing the construction on the project, Van Oord, told Nature that environmental management for the project is overseen by the EPA and that it is working with the agency and local specialists to minimize the environmental impacts. Van Oord said it prepared a comprehensive environmental management plan \u201cbased on the mitigation measures mandated in the EIA and in compliance with international guidelines\u201d. As part of its efforts, the company relocated coral and seagrass, and added silt screens to limit how much sediment would flow beyond the reclamation zone and affect other areas. Van Oord, which is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told Nature that \u201call the predicted impacts have been effectively managed by implementing a series of mitigation measures\u201d. In October 2022, the EPA approved the project. But critics say the environmental costs of the reclamation are too high. \u201cI think their efforts are not worth the amount of destruction and the irreversible damage,\u201d says Mohamed. \u201cIt can never be compensated properly.\u201d Today, the land in front of Shaiz\u2019s hotel is the result of that decision. Yet if you speak to people on Addu, many say that land is not what they need right now; they need jobs. Much of Addu is filled with empty, unfinished homes because individuals don\u2019t have the income or resources to build houses on their free land. \u201cFifty per cent [of our land] is abandoned or empty,\u201d says Addu\u2019s former deputy mayor, Abdullah Thoyyib, who served the city before this reclamation project took place. \u201cWe need economic benefits and job opportunities, but that\u2019s not happening.\u201d Sitting in a resort in Addu City, Nisal Musthag places a map of Addu\u2019s main diving spots on the table. Musthag leads diving trips for one of the two active resorts in the atoll, and he has seen some of the damage that follows reclamation projects. He points at one of the four channels between the island\u2019s lagoon and the ocean. \u201cThis is like a cemetery now,\u201d he says. Musthag does three to four dives a day, six days a week. Since the most-recent reclamation, there are at least five sites he no longer takes guests to. \u201cThere are people who come back every year to dive, and this year they were like, hey, what\u2019s happening?\u201d The impacts of reclamation on coral health are one of researchers\u2019 main concerns. Some reefs die when sediment is dumped on them to create new land. But even corals that escape direct damage can be harmed because the construction work creates clouds of sediment that spread out and settle on more distant reefs. Robbed of light and nutrients, these corals can struggle to survive. The damage to reefs not only harms the ecosystem but can also leave the islands vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise, say scientists. To reduce damage to corals during the work at Addu, the EIA required that at least 10% of existing corals be relocated outside the reclamation footprints. Van Oord says it has moved 73,000 corals to 9 recipient sites identified in conjunction with the EPA. The firm says that it \u201ccertainly surpassed the EIA requirement\u201d. Saleem Rasheed is one of several local divers who helped to relocate the corals. He has been monitoring them for the past year. One species, blue coral (Heliopora coerulea), which was moved from the outside of the atoll to the inside, died completely. \u201cWe moved 80 colonies,\u201d says Rasheed. \u201cThey survived one week and died entirely after six months.\u201d But the rest of the species have shown resilience. Three months after relocation, they were struggling, but now, Rasheed says, they are alive and well. Researchers have found that coral relocation can work if colonies are moved to areas with similar conditions that are protected from waves. A 2017 study in Hawaii, for example, showed that relocated corals were thriving a decade after they were moved. One study on coral restoration and relocation in the Maldives measured the survival rate of 242 coral fragments 12 months after they had been moved. The authors found a 70% survival rate, which they concluded was a promising result. But coral health is only one concern for researchers studying the effects of reclamation. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coastal ecosystems can also be in harm\u2019s way, say scientists. Water Solutions\u2019 second report about the Addu project, for example, projected that the reclamation process would bury about 98 hectares of seagrass meadow in the atoll\u2019s lagoon, at an estimated economic cost of more than $3.7 million a year. Not far from Shaiz\u2019s hotel, a sea wall stretches towards the horizon, protecting a new swathe of land made of sand and coral debris. Coastal protection efforts such as the sea wall \u2014 and the changes wrought by reclamation \u2014 could have long-lasting effects on the processes that keep the islands from eroding, say researchers. Like other atolls, the Maldivian islands evolve with the seasons, with monsoons moving sand around them. Between December and February, the winds transport sand from the northeast to the southwest. Between June and August, the pattern reverses. \u201cIn a natural island, you will see seasonally the sand shifting with the waves and the currents,\u201d says Mohamed. But reclamation can impede this process, he adds, by taking sand and coral debris from some locations through dredging \u2014 leaving a deficit in its wake \u2014 and depositing it where natural flows wouldn\u2019t. Some projects add another complication by building hard barriers, such as sea walls, to protect the land, because they can stop the natural flow of sediments. \u201cEcosystems can adapt if we allow them to,\u201d says van Wesenbeeck at Deltares. \u201cBy interfering, you will kill the whole system in the end.\u201d Not only does this change how the island naturally maintains itself, but it can also draw development to places that are at a high risk of a storm surge or erosion, say some researchers. \u201cIslands can\u2019t occur anywhere,\u201d says Virginie Duvat, a coastal geographer at La Rochelle University in France, who has studied the effects of land reclamation in the Maldives. \u201cIf you put an island where there was naturally no island, you create vulnerable land and you will necessarily have to build strong engineered structures, breakwaters and sea walls,\u201d she says. In a 2019 study, Duvat and Alexandre Magnan, a geographer at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations \u2014 Sciences Po in Paris, assessed the scale of coastal changes that humans had made to 107 inhabited islands in the Maldives between 2004\u201306 and 2014\u201316. On almost half the islands, the researchers found significant degradation in the reefs\u2019 abilities to weaken waves and provide natural sources of sediments. One-fifth of the islands had almost entirely or entirely \u201clost their natural capacity to respond and adjust to ocean climate-related pressures\u201d, the researchers say. \u201cIt means that a decision you have taken one day to rely on reclaimed land will necessarily cause you to invest more money,\u201d says Duvat. \u201cYou are locked into the engineered path for decades and decades and potentially the rest of the century.\u201d \u201cIf you build a levee, people will think they\u2019re safe,\u201d says van Wesenbeeck. \u201cBut is it wise to destroy environmental assets to create investment in an area that\u2019s one of the most vulnerable in the world for climate change?\u201d Some 550 km to the north of Addu, the capital, Mal\u00e9, sits like an overpopulated postage stamp in the middle of the ocean. Mal\u00e9 is tiny \u2014 less than 2 km across at its widest point \u2014 but more than 200,000 people live on the island. To relieve population pressures, the government decided in the late 1990s to start reclaiming a massive atoll next to Mal\u00e9, called Hulhumal\u00e9. Hulhumal\u00e9 has become known as \u2018the city of hope\u2019 \u2014 a place that not only has room but is also protected from sea-level rise. Architects designed it with sea-level-rise scenarios until 2100 in mind. The outer edges are 2 metres above sea level, more than twice the height of Mal\u00e9. Hulhulmal\u00e9 is regarded by specialists mainly as a worthwhile success for land reclamation, but critics have raised many questions about three newer projects on the western side of Mal\u00e9, all of which are being built using sand from the nearby lagoon. In 2021, Humay Abdulghafoor, a Mal\u00e9-based veteran fighter against land reclamation, sued three institutional bodies of the government on the grounds that they violated an environmental-protection law.

And it's picked up the pace in recent years.\nIn the last 80 years, sea level rise has risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that total in the last 30 years, said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's best estimates, that pace is expected to speed up\u2014dramatically.\nIt took about 80 years for the first foot. The second one will only take 30 years. The next, 20 years. And Florida could see the next foot in merely a decade after that.\n\"Sea level rise is beginning to speed up a bit,\" McNoldy said. \"If you draw a straight line it starts to not look so straight in recent decades.\"\nThat's according to NOAA's \"intermediate-high\" projection of sea level rise. The agency created a range of predictions\u2014low, intermediate-low, intermediate, intermediate-high and high\u2014to estimate what sea level rise could look like in places like Florida.\nSo far, scientists have found that we're trending toward the high end of those predictions.\n\"Presently, sea level is tracking in the intermediate-high to high, the two fastest,\" said Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist with Florida International University. \"The other three scenarios, you might not even think about because we're already rising faster than that.\"\nThose are the same predictions used by South Florida governments when deciding how high to build new developments. But after a new bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year, local governments hoping for state money for sea rise projects have to only consider the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios, a downgrade from previous legislation that asked them to consider intermediate-low and intermediate-high scenarios.\nWhat goes into a sea rise projection?\nTwo feet of sea rise by 2060, compared to present-day levels, would be a shock to the system for Miami, where the average elevation is three feet. That's why local governments\u2014and the state\u2014are spending billions to keep streets dry.\nHowever, pinning down exactly how much sea rise South Florida could experience is a tough task.\nResearchers know the two main factors in sea level rise are the temperature of the ocean and how much the ice sheets melt. As burned fossil fuels trap more heat in the atmosphere, that heat is largely being absorbed by the ocean. Hotter water physically takes up more space than cold water, so a hotter ocean means higher sea levels. A hotter atmosphere also means gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, pouring tremendous amounts of now-liquid water into the sea.\nThose two issues make up the lion's share of impact to rising sea levels, but South Florida also has its own unique challenges that add to rising water levels.\nThere's the fact that some parts of the land are actually sinking, a process known as subsidence. However, it's not very much\u2014the depth of two credit cards stacked on top of each other over half a decade in one spot in Miami Beach.\n\"It does add to an already dire situation, but it isn't a driving force,\" Parkinson said.\nThe one big unknown in South Florida's future of sea level rise is likely the water rushing offshore. The Gulf Stream, a massive current that moves hot water from the tropics to the frigid depths of the Arctic, has a little offshoot that runs between Florida's east coast and the Bahamas.\nThe Florida Current, as it's known, has an impact on Miami's water levels. When the current is stronger, water levels are generally a bit lower in Miami. And when it's weaker, they have been shown to rise.\nA new paper from Lisa Beal, professor of ocean sciences at UM's Rosenstiel School, and Chris Piecuch, a physical oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, found for the first time that this current may be slowing down.\n\"We found that there is a weakening. It's small,\" she said.\nThe article, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in September, suggested that the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% in the last 40 years, although it did not directly link that change to global warming.\nBeal said the findings were significant for Florida.\n\"We shouldn't get carried away that weakening of the Gulf Stream is going to double sea level rise in Miami. It isn't,\" she said. However, \"when you're so low-lying like South Florida, you'd kind of want to know because it means you reach thresholds of flooding much more quickly.\"\nBut perhaps the biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise boils down to one thing: exactly how much more pollution the world will continue to spew into the atmosphere. The lower-end predictions account for a world in which governments stop burning fossil fuels quickly, and the higher-end predictions are based on a situation where we burn even more than we are now.\n\"One of the great unknowns is, the world needs to be attempting to slow down the release of greenhouse gases,\" McNoldy said.\n\nJournal information:\nGeophysical Research Letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  2024 Miami Herald.

But those among the estimated 20 million people living along Bangladesh's coast say the destruction comes in terrifying waves.\n\"It is closing in,\" said fisherman Aziz about the approaching sea. \"Where else can we escape?\"\n'Bodies can't endure this'\nThe threat is increasing.\nMost of the country's coastal areas are a meter or two above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, turning wells and lakes salty and killing crops on once fertile land.\n\"When the surge is higher, the seawater intrudes into our houses and land,\" said Ismail Howladar, a 65-year-old farmer growing chili peppers, sweet potatoes, sunflowers and rice.\n\"It brings only loss for us.\"\nCyclones -- which have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades -- are becoming more frequent as well as growing in intensity and duration due to the impact of climate change, scientists say.\nShahjalal Mia, a 63-year-old restaurant owner, said he watches the sea \"grasp more land\" each year.\n\"Many people have lost their homes to the sea already,\" he said. \"If there is no beach, there won't be any tourists.\"\nHe said he had experienced cyclones and searing heat waves grow worse, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).\n\"We are facing two, three, even four cyclones every year now,\" he said.\n\"And I can't measure temperatures in degrees but, simply put, our bodies can't endure this\".\n'Too late'\nBangladesh is among the countries ranked most vulnerable to disasters and climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\nIn April, the nation of around 170 million people experienced the hottest month, and the most sustained heat wave temperatures, in its history.\nLast month, a cyclone that killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes, was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting seen, the government's meteorological department said.\nBoth events were pinned on rising global temperatures.\nAinun Nishat, from Brac University in the capital Dhaka, said that the poorest were paying the price for carbon emissions from wealthier nations.\n\"We cannot do anything for Bangladesh if other nations, notably rich countries, do not do anything to fight emissions,\" he said.\nBangladesh is running out of time, Nishat added.\n\"It is becoming too late to prevent disasters,\" he said. \"We are unequipped to bring change.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \u00a9 2024 AFP\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nExplore further\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\n Feedback to editors\n15 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\nSep 22, 2024\n0\n7 hours ago\n8 hours ago\n9 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n13 hours ago\n13 hours ago\n13 hours ago\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\nSep 19, 2024\nSep 7, 2024\nSep 7, 2024\nAug 23, 2024\nAug 23, 2024\nAug 18, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore from Earth Sciences\n\nRelated Stories\nMay 28, 2024\nMay 1, 2024\nApr 29, 2024\nMay 27, 2024\nMay 26, 2024\nMay 28, 2024\nRecommended for you\n18 hours ago\n16 hours ago\nSep 21, 2024\nSep 21, 2024\nSep 20, 2024\nSep 20, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse this form if you have come across a typo, inaccuracy or would like to send an edit request for the content on this page.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general inquiries, please use our  contact form.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general feedback, use the public comments section below (please adhere to guidelines).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPlease select the most appropriate category to facilitate processing of your request\nThank you for taking time to provide your feedback to the editors.\nYour feedback is important to us.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Sea levels are rising faster in South Florida, impacting roads and homes. Over the past 80 years, sea levels have risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that rise occurring in the last 30 years, according to Brian McNoldy from the University of Miami. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts this pace will accelerate, with the next foot of rise expected in just 30 years, then 20 years, and possibly a decade after that. Currently, sea levels are tracking towards NOAA's intermediate-high to high projections, the fastest scenarios. Local governments in South Florida use these projections to plan new developments, although recent legislation now requires them to consider only the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios for state-funded projects. The main factors driving sea level rise are ocean temperature and ice sheet melt. As fossil fuels trap more heat, the ocean absorbs it, causing water to expand and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, adding more water to the sea. South Florida also faces land subsidence, though it's minimal. The Florida Current, part of the Gulf Stream, affects Miami's water levels; a weaker current can lead to higher sea levels. A study by Lisa Beal and Chris Piecuch found the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% over the last 40 years. The biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise is the amount of pollution the world will continue to emit. Lower-end predictions assume a rapid reduction in fossil fuel use, while higher-end predictions assume continued or increased emissions.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "After cyclone gales destroyed his home in 2007, Bangladeshi fisherman Abdul Aziz moved half a kilometer inland. A year later, the sea swallowed his old home. Now, 75-year-old Aziz fishes above his submerged former home and lives behind a low embankment. Government scientists report that rising seas driven by climate change are submerging Bangladesh's coast at one of the fastest global rates, potentially displacing at least a million people within a generation. Abdul Hamid, director general of the environment department, noted that Bangladesh experiences the effects of climate change intensely. A recent three-part study found that sea levels in Bangladesh are rising more than 60% higher than the global average. By 2050, over a million people may need to relocate due to local sea level rise, based on 25 years of satellite data from NASA and CNSA. Study lead A.K.M Saiful Islam attributed the above-average increases to melting ice caps, warming oceans, and river water from the monsoon. The study observed sea level rises of 4.2 to 5.8 millimeters annually along Bangladesh's coast, compared to the global average of 3.7 millimeters. This incremental rise has devastating effects on the estimated 20 million coastal residents. Most coastal areas are just one or two meters above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, salinizing wells and lakes and killing crops. Cyclones, which have killed hundreds of thousands in recent decades, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Shahjalal Mia, a restaurant owner, noted the worsening cyclones and heat waves, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. Bangladesh is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. In April, the country experienced its hottest month and most sustained heat wave. A recent cyclone killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes. Ainun Nishat from Brac University emphasized that the poorest are paying the price for emissions from wealthier nations. He warned that it is becoming too late to prevent disasters, and Bangladesh is unequipped to bring change.",

And it's picked up the pace in recent years.\nIn the last 80 years, sea level rise has risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that total in the last 30 years, said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's best estimates, that pace is expected to speed up\u2014dramatically.\nIt took about 80 years for the first foot. The second one will only take 30 years. The next, 20 years. And Florida could see the next foot in merely a decade after that.\n\"Sea level rise is beginning to speed up a bit,\" McNoldy said. \"If you draw a straight line it starts to not look so straight in recent decades.\"\nThat's according to NOAA's \"intermediate-high\" projection of sea level rise. The agency created a range of predictions\u2014low, intermediate-low, intermediate, intermediate-high and high\u2014to estimate what sea level rise could look like in places like Florida.\nSo far, scientists have found that we're trending toward the high end of those predictions.\n\"Presently, sea level is tracking in the intermediate-high to high, the two fastest,\" said Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist with Florida International University. \"The other three scenarios, you might not even think about because we're already rising faster than that.\"\nThose are the same predictions used by South Florida governments when deciding how high to build new developments. But after a new bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year, local governments hoping for state money for sea rise projects have to only consider the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios, a downgrade from previous legislation that asked them to consider intermediate-low and intermediate-high scenarios.\nWhat goes into a sea rise projection?\nTwo feet of sea rise by 2060, compared to present-day levels, would be a shock to the system for Miami, where the average elevation is three feet. That's why local governments\u2014and the state\u2014are spending billions to keep streets dry.\nHowever, pinning down exactly how much sea rise South Florida could experience is a tough task.\nResearchers know the two main factors in sea level rise are the temperature of the ocean and how much the ice sheets melt. As burned fossil fuels trap more heat in the atmosphere, that heat is largely being absorbed by the ocean. Hotter water physically takes up more space than cold water, so a hotter ocean means higher sea levels. A hotter atmosphere also means gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, pouring tremendous amounts of now-liquid water into the sea.\nThose two issues make up the lion's share of impact to rising sea levels, but South Florida also has its own unique challenges that add to rising water levels.\nThere's the fact that some parts of the land are actually sinking, a process known as subsidence. However, it's not very much\u2014the depth of two credit cards stacked on top of each other over half a decade in one spot in Miami Beach.\n\"It does add to an already dire situation, but it isn't a driving force,\" Parkinson said.\nThe one big unknown in South Florida's future of sea level rise is likely the water rushing offshore. The Gulf Stream, a massive current that moves hot water from the tropics to the frigid depths of the Arctic, has a little offshoot that runs between Florida's east coast and the Bahamas.\nThe Florida Current, as it's known, has an impact on Miami's water levels. When the current is stronger, water levels are generally a bit lower in Miami. And when it's weaker, they have been shown to rise.\nA new paper from Lisa Beal, professor of ocean sciences at UM's Rosenstiel School, and Chris Piecuch, a physical oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, found for the first time that this current may be slowing down.\n\"We found that there is a weakening. It's small,\" she said.\nThe article, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in September, suggested that the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% in the last 40 years, although it did not directly link that change to global warming.\nBeal said the findings were significant for Florida.\n\"We shouldn't get carried away that weakening of the Gulf Stream is going to double sea level rise in Miami. It isn't,\" she said. However, \"when you're so low-lying like South Florida, you'd kind of want to know because it means you reach thresholds of flooding much more quickly.\"\nBut perhaps the biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise boils down to one thing: exactly how much more pollution the world will continue to spew into the atmosphere. The lower-end predictions account for a world in which governments stop burning fossil fuels quickly, and the higher-end predictions are based on a situation where we burn even more than we are now.\n\"One of the great unknowns is, the world needs to be attempting to slow down the release of greenhouse gases,\" McNoldy said.\n\nJournal information:\nGeophysical Research Letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  2024 Miami Herald.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Sea levels are rising faster in South Florida, impacting roads and homes. Over the past 80 years, sea levels have risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that rise occurring in the last 30 years, according to Brian McNoldy from the University of Miami. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts this pace will accelerate, with the next foot of rise expected in just 30 years, then 20 years, and possibly a decade after that. Currently, sea levels are tracking towards NOAA's intermediate-high to high projections, the fastest scenarios. Local governments in South Florida use these projections to plan new developments, although recent legislation now requires them to consider only the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios for state-funded projects. The main factors driving sea level rise are ocean temperature and ice sheet melt. As fossil fuels trap more heat, the ocean absorbs it, causing water to expand and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, adding more water to the sea. South Florida also faces land subsidence, though it's minimal. The Florida Current, part of the Gulf Stream, affects Miami's water levels; a weaker current can lead to higher sea levels. A study by Lisa Beal and Chris Piecuch found the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% over the last 40 years. The biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise is the amount of pollution the world will continue to emit. Lower-end predictions assume a rapid reduction in fossil fuel use, while higher-end predictions assume continued or increased emissions.",

But those among the estimated 20 million people living along Bangladesh's coast say the destruction comes in terrifying waves.\n\"It is closing in,\" said fisherman Aziz about the approaching sea. \"Where else can we escape?\"\n'Bodies can't endure this'\nThe threat is increasing.\nMost of the country's coastal areas are a meter or two above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, turning wells and lakes salty and killing crops on once fertile land.\n\"When the surge is higher, the seawater intrudes into our houses and land,\" said Ismail Howladar, a 65-year-old farmer growing chili peppers, sweet potatoes, sunflowers and rice.\n\"It brings only loss for us.\"\nCyclones -- which have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades -- are becoming more frequent as well as growing in intensity and duration due to the impact of climate change, scientists say.\nShahjalal Mia, a 63-year-old restaurant owner, said he watches the sea \"grasp more land\" each year.\n\"Many people have lost their homes to the sea already,\" he said. \"If there is no beach, there won't be any tourists.\"\nHe said he had experienced cyclones and searing heat waves grow worse, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).\n\"We are facing two, three, even four cyclones every year now,\" he said.\n\"And I can't measure temperatures in degrees but, simply put, our bodies can't endure this\".\n'Too late'\nBangladesh is among the countries ranked most vulnerable to disasters and climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\nIn April, the nation of around 170 million people experienced the hottest month, and the most sustained heat wave temperatures, in its history.\nLast month, a cyclone that killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes, was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting seen, the government's meteorological department said.\nBoth events were pinned on rising global temperatures.\nAinun Nishat, from Brac University in the capital Dhaka, said that the poorest were paying the price for carbon emissions from wealthier nations.\n\"We cannot do anything for Bangladesh if other nations, notably rich countries, do not do anything to fight emissions,\" he said.\nBangladesh is running out of time, Nishat added.\n\"It is becoming too late to prevent disasters,\" he said. \"We are unequipped to bring change.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \u00a9 2024 AFP\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nExplore further\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\n Feedback to editors\n15 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\nSep 22, 2024\n0\n7 hours ago\n8 hours ago\n9 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n13 hours ago\n13 hours ago\n13 hours ago\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\nSep 19, 2024\nSep 7, 2024\nSep 7, 2024\nAug 23, 2024\nAug 23, 2024\nAug 18, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore from Earth Sciences\n\nRelated Stories\nMay 28, 2024\nMay 1, 2024\nApr 29, 2024\nMay 27, 2024\nMay 26, 2024\nMay 28, 2024\nRecommended for you\n18 hours ago\n16 hours ago\nSep 21, 2024\nSep 21, 2024\nSep 20, 2024\nSep 20, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse this form if you have come across a typo, inaccuracy or would like to send an edit request for the content on this page.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general inquiries, please use our  contact form.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general feedback, use the public comments section below (please adhere to guidelines).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPlease select the most appropriate category to facilitate processing of your request\nThank you for taking time to provide your feedback to the editors.\nYour feedback is important to us.

That is equivalent to a change of 0.50 feet in 100 years.\n\nThe plot shows the monthly mean sea level without the regular seasonal fluctuations due to coastal ocean temperatures, salinities, winds, atmospheric pressures, and ocean currents. By default, the long-term linear trend is also shown, in red, along with its 95% confidence interval. The plotted values are relative to the most recent Mean Sea Level datum established by NOAA CO-OPS.\n\nOptions:\n- Show calculated linear trend (linear regression)\n- Show linear trend 95% confidence intervals\n- Show linear trend 95% prediction intervals\n- Show quadratic regression\n- Show quadratic trend 95% confidence intervals\n- Show quadratic trend 95% prediction intervals\n- Show NOAA's linear trend\n- Show NOAA's linear trend 95% confidence intervals\n- Show CO2 levels\n\nBoxcar smoothing: Enable\nWidth: \nRepeat: \nLine weight: thin, medium, thick\nColor scheme: \n\nData source: All, NOAA, PSMSL\n\nHeight: pixels (default 450).\nWidth: pixels (default is determined by window width).

To download the seasonally-adjusted monthly MSL data from NOAA in CSV format click here, or for unadjusted (\"raw\") data click here.\n\nWe also have a graph of just carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and a combined graph of CO2 and CH4.\n\nCalculation of Confidence Intervals and Prediction Intervals for monthly Mean Sea-Level (MSL) is complicated by the fact that MSL measurement data is serially autocorrelated. That means each month's MSL measurement is correlated, to an extent which varies by location, with the MSL measurements of the previous and next months. That means there are effectively fewer independent measurements, which would cause a naive confidence interval calculation to underestimate the breadth of the intervals. The code here follows the method of Zervas 2009, \u201cSea Level Variations of the United States 1854-2006,\u201d NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 053 (or here), p. 15-24, to account for autocorrelation, when calculating confidence intervals and prediction intervals. That isn't the only way to do it, though, and one of the items on my to-do list is to examine alternative approaches.\n\nSome data is excluded from regression calculations\n\nReferences: I am grateful to the following data providers:\n1.

    "Summarized_Document2": "After cyclone gales destroyed his home in 2007, Bangladeshi fisherman Abdul Aziz moved half a kilometer inland. A year later, the sea swallowed his old home. Now, 75-year-old Aziz fishes above his submerged former home and lives behind a low embankment. Government scientists report that rising seas driven by climate change are submerging Bangladesh's coast at one of the fastest global rates, potentially displacing at least a million people within a generation. Abdul Hamid, director general of the environment department, noted that Bangladesh experiences the effects of climate change intensely. A recent three-part study found that sea levels in Bangladesh are rising more than 60% higher than the global average. By 2050, over a million people may need to relocate due to local sea level rise, based on 25 years of satellite data from NASA and CNSA. Study lead A.K.M Saiful Islam attributed the above-average increases to melting ice caps, warming oceans, and river water from the monsoon. The study observed sea level rises of 4.2 to 5.8 millimeters annually along Bangladesh's coast, compared to the global average of 3.7 millimeters. This incremental rise has devastating effects on the estimated 20 million coastal residents. Most coastal areas are just one or two meters above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, salinizing wells and lakes and killing crops. Cyclones, which have killed hundreds of thousands in recent decades, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Shahjalal Mia, a restaurant owner, noted the worsening cyclones and heat waves, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. Bangladesh is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. In April, the country experienced its hottest month and most sustained heat wave. A recent cyclone killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes. Ainun Nishat from Brac University emphasized that the poorest are paying the price for emissions from wealthier nations. He warned that it is becoming too late to prevent disasters, and Bangladesh is unequipped to bring change.",

Such guidance is based on information available on the date of this press release, and the company assumes no obligation to update it. \nThe company's future performance involves risks and uncertainties, and the company's actual results could differ materially from the information below and elsewhere in this press release. Some of the factors that could affect the company's operating results are set forth under the caption \"Forward-Looking Statements\" above in this press release. More information about factors that could affect the company's operating results is included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form\u00a010-Q, copies of which may be obtained by visiting eBay's investor relations website at https://investors.ebayinc.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\neBay Inc.\n\n\nThree Months Ending\n\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(In billions, except per share amounts)\nGAAP\n\nNon-GAAP (a)\nNet revenues\n$2.50 - $2.56\n\n$2.50 - $2.56\nDiluted EPS\n$0.82 - $0.87\n\n$1.15 - $1.20\n\n\n\n\n(a) Estimated non-GAAP amounts above for the three months ending September 30, 2024 reflect adjustments that exclude the estimated amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $9 - $11 million, estimated stock-based compensation expense and associated employer payroll tax expense of approximately $140 - $150 million, and estimated adjustment between our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of approximately $25 - $35 million. The estimated GAAP diluted EPS above does not assume any gains or losses on our equity investments.\n\u00a0\neBay Inc.Non-GAAP\u00a0Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement the company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free cash flow and figures in this press release presented on an \"FX-Neutral basis.\" These non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate the company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nReconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release, except for figures in this press release presented on an \"FX-Neutral basis,\" can be found in the tables included in this press release. For figures in this press release reported on an \"FX-Neutral basis,\" the company calculates the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates, excluding hedging activity, applied to current year transactional currency amounts.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company's management uses financial measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure and related foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses from the disposal/acquisition of a business, certain gains and losses on investments including changes in fair value, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of any related foreign exchange derivative instruments, gains or losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with Adyen, restructuring-related charges and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, the company's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of the company.\nThe company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income and margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:\nStock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes.\u00a0This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases. The company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on the company's stock price and the vesting of restricted stock by employees and the timing and size of stock option exercises, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the company's operation of the business.\nAmortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, certain amortization of deferred tax assets and related foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and certain gains or losses on investments. The company incurs amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP measures. The company also excludes certain gains and losses on investments. The company excludes the non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure, which is not reduced by the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and related foreign exchange effects. The company excludes these items because management does not believe they correlate to the ongoing operating results of the company's business.\nRestructuring.\u00a0These charges consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes significant restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nOther certain significant gains, losses, or charges that are not indicative of the company's core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly or be repeated in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its results primarily because management does not believe they are indicative of its current or ongoing operating results.\u00a0 These amounts include changes in fair value and the related change in foreign currency exchange rates of equity securities with readily determinable fair values, globally.\nChange in fair market value of warrant.\u00a0These are gains or losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with Adyen, which are attributable to changes in fair value during the period.\nIncome tax effects and adjustments.\u00a0We use a non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating our operating results. Based on our current long-term projections, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5%. This non-GAAP tax rate could change for various reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment. The company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company's business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock and pay dividends. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period and does not exclude certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements.\neBay Inc.\nReconciliation of GAAP\u00a0Operating Income to Non-GAAP\u00a0Operating Income*\n\n\nThree

    "Document2": "Customer Churn Rate: How to Calculate and Improve Churn\n8 min read\nTracking your customer churn rate will help you keep tabs on business growth.\nYou will have data sets for analyzing your churn/retention history, which will better position you to make intelligent business decisions.\nThis article shows you various ways to calculate churn, make sense of the data, and create proactive solutions to retain more customers.\nWhat is customer churn?\nCustomer churn is the rate at which customers discontinue their subscription or stop using a particular product or service.\nChurn could happen for various reasons, from customer dissatisfaction with your brand to changing business needs that make them switch to competitors (more on that later).\nTypes of churn rates you should calculate\nChurn is quite broad. Differentiating the different types will help you track and reduce attrition with ease.\nLet\u2019s go over the most common types of churn:\nHow to calculate the customer churn rate?\nTo calculate customer churn, use this simple formula: Divide the number of users lost during the period of interest by the number of users you had at the start of the period. Multiply the result by 100.\nFor example, imagine you started the year with 700 customers but somehow lost 50 by July. Your churn rate is 50/700 X 100 = 7%\nHow to calculate the revenue churn rate?\nTo calculate revenue churn, divide the net revenue lost from existing customers in a given period by the total revenue at the beginning of the period.\nFor example, if your March loss from downgrades is $4,000 while the MRR is $80,000, your revenue churn is 0.05.\nYou can calculate your revenue churn monthly or annually.\nHaving both numbers provides a more nuanced and complete picture of customer retention. It also helps in identifying short-term trends, setting long-term goals, benchmarking performance, and making critical decisions to improve customer retention.\nMonthly churn rate formula\nYour monthly churn rate refers to the percentage of customers lost over a month.\nHow to calculate: (number of customers you had at the beginning of the month) \u2013 (number of customers you had at the end of the month) / number of customers you had at the beginning of the month X 100.\nMonthly tracking comes with several benefits. For instance, you can use the data for cohort and retention analysis or to create a churn prediction model that tells you which months of the year customers are more likely to churn.\nAnnual churn rate formula\nThe annual churn rate is the percentage of customers you lose in a year. Similar to the monthly churn rate, calculate this metric by dividing the number of customers lost in a year by the number you had at the start of the year. Multiply the figure by 100.\nAnnual churn rates will flatten out the influence of seasonality or marketing campaigns on churn so you can see your business\u2019s long-term story and set benchmarks for yourself.\nHow to use the adjusted churn rate formula?\nFast-growing companies might struggle with a churn rate formula that only accounts for lost customers.\nA more complex formula showing churned customers while also including the users added in that period will provide more accurate data.\nUse the following formula to get a better picture of your churn rate:\n(Y / [ (W+X) / 2 ] ) x 100 = Z\nWhat is a good churn rate: SaaS customer churn benchmarks\nThe ideal churn rate varies, depending on your growth stage.\nFor established SaaS companies, the average is between 5% to 7% churn per year and around 1% or less monthly.\nEarly-stage startups will understandably have higher churn as they\u2019re still getting their footing, may still be struggling with product-market fit, or have products needing improvement. If you\u2019re an early-stage startup or SMB, expect an average annual churn of 10% to 15%.\nChurn also depends on your industry. Subscription management platform Recurly sampled over 1,500 sites in 19 months and reported how churn rates differ between industries. Take a look:\nMost common reasons behind high churn rates\nChurn can happen for a thousand and one reason. But here are the most common ones:\nOther metrics subscription-based companies should track\nBy tracking the following metrics, you\u2019ll have a more holistic understanding of your business and identify improvement areas:\n7 Customer retention strategies to reduce customer churn rates\nWe\u2019ve already discussed numerous ways to calculate, track, and benchmark churn. The next logical step would be actively working on improving your rates.\nImplement the following strategies to increase customer retention in your SaaS:\nPersonalize user onboarding for different customer segments\nPersonalization streamlines your onboarding flow and ensures users only see the features they need. Users will experience value fast, reach activation quickly, and be more willing to stick with you.\nYou can create personalized onboarding by using a welcome survey to collect new user data. Focus your survey questions on understanding the user\u2019s pain points and jobs to be done. Use that data to personalize their onboarding paths.\nUse interactive walkthroughs to contextually guide new customers\nInteractive walkthroughs show users how to use a feature step-by-step. Trigger it contextually to eliminate confusion and help users gain value from your features.\nThis is much better than bland product tours\u2014or worse, leaving users to figure out your tool on their own.\nContextual guidance improves feature adoption rates, and churn will reduce as customers begin to use and find your features valuable.\nLeverage secondary onboarding to retain existing customers\nOnboarding doesn\u2019t stop when new customers start using your tool comfortably. Employ secondary onboarding\u2014introduce users to more advanced features and use cases once they\u2019ve adopted the key features.\nYou can do this with contextual in-app messages such as modals, hotspots, tooltips, etc.\nSecondary onboarding drives repeated value and improves product adoption breadth and depth. Churn also reduces because the more users integrate the product into their lives, the less likely they are to stop using it.\nMeasure customer satisfaction across the user journey\nUse short microsurveys to measure customer satisfaction at different touchpoints. The typical CSAT survey is quantitative, but you can also ask follow-up questions for qualitative insights. Combining both will help you better understand what causes dissatisfaction.\nThe next step is to segment unhappy customers and proactively reach out to them to offer help and prevent churn.\nOffer self-serve support to remove friction and improve customer experience\nMaking customers who already have a problem wait for hours before receiving help will only push them away further. Prevent this by building robust self-serve support that allows users to get quick and easy help no matter the time of day.\nYou can go one step further and personalize the help according to users\u2019 JTBD and place it in the customer journey. For example, you might have sections such as \u201cGetting Started,\u201d \u201cTroubleshooting,\u201d \u201cAdvanced Features,\u201d \u201cAccount Management,\u201d etc.\nYou can also utilize user data and behavior to dynamically recommend relevant knowledge base content.\nTrack in-app customer behavior to identify at-risk customers\nDefinitely keep tabs on customer pulse and monitor user behavior to identify drops and spikes in user activity. Try to analyze further to find the reasons for the sudden changes.\nSegment disengaged users and trigger re-engagement flows to win them over. This could be anything from win-back email campaigns to tooltips that prompt users to engage with a key feature that will bring value to them.\nCollect feedback from churned customers to understand what went wrong\nChurn surveys let you know the reasons behind churn and fix them to prevent other customers from leaving for the same reasons.\nAs with every survey, timing is important here. Trigger your churn surveys in-app as soon as users hit the cancel account button. No one will go ahead and answer a survey they got via email after they finished canceling their account.\nConclusion\nEnsure to regularly track churn rates (monthly is ideal). This will enable you to make data-driven decisions that proactively prevent churn among new and existing users.\nUserpilot can help with that. As previously mentioned, our platform lets you understand churn through user behavior tracking and in-app surveys and triggers customized product experiences to drive retention.\nBook a demo now to talk with our team and begin the process of reducing the customer churn rate for your business!\nLeave a comment Cancel reply\n Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nThe fastest way to learn about Product Growth,Management & Trends.\nThe coolest way to learn about Product Growth, Management & Trends.\nDelivered fresh to your inbox, weekly.\n\n\n\nGet The Insights!\nThe fastest way to learn about Product Growth,\nManagement & Trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also be interested in ...What Are AARRR Metrics?

    "Summarized_Document2": "Tracking your customer churn rate will help you keep tabs on business growth. You will have data sets for analyzing your churn/retention history, which will better position you to make intelligent business decisions. This article shows you various ways to calculate churn, make sense of the data, and create proactive solutions to retain more customers.\n\nCustomer churn is the rate at which customers discontinue their subscription or stop using a particular product or service. Churn could happen for various reasons, from customer dissatisfaction with your brand to changing business needs that make them switch to competitors.\n\nTo calculate customer churn, use this simple formula: Divide the number of users lost during the period of interest by the number of users you had at the start of the period. Multiply the result by 100. For example, if you started the year with 700 customers but lost 50 by July, your churn rate is 50/700 X 100 = 7%.\n\nTo calculate revenue churn, divide the net revenue lost from existing customers in a given period by the total revenue at the beginning of the period. For example, if your March loss from downgrades is $4,000 while the MRR is $80,000, your revenue churn is 0.05. You can calculate your revenue churn monthly or annually.\n\nYour monthly churn rate refers to the percentage of customers lost over a month. Calculate it by: (number of customers you had at the beginning of the month) \u2013 (number of customers you had at the end of the month) / number of customers you had at the beginning of the month X 100.\n\nThe annual churn rate is the percentage of customers you lose in a year. Calculate this metric by dividing the number of customers lost in a year by the number you had at the start of the year. Multiply the figure by 100.\n\nFast-growing companies might struggle with a churn rate formula that only accounts for lost customers. A more complex formula showing churned customers while also including the users added in that period will provide more accurate data. Use the following formula to get a better picture of your churn rate: (Y / [ (W+X) / 2 ] ) x 100 = Z.\n\nThe ideal churn rate varies, depending on your growth stage. For established SaaS companies, the average is between 5% to 7% churn per year and around 1% or less monthly. Early-stage startups will understandably have higher churn as they\u2019re still getting their footing, may still be struggling with product-market fit, or have products needing improvement. If you\u2019re an early-stage startup or SMB, expect an average annual churn of 10% to 15%.\n\nChurn can happen for a thousand and one reasons. But here are the most common ones:\n\nBy tracking the following metrics, you\u2019ll have a more holistic understanding of your business and identify improvement areas:\n\nWe\u2019ve already discussed numerous ways to calculate, track, and benchmark churn. The next logical step would be actively working on improving your rates. Implement the following strategies to increase customer retention in your SaaS:\n\n1. Personalize user onboarding for different customer segments.\n2. Use interactive walkthroughs to contextually guide new customers.\n3. Leverage secondary onboarding to retain existing customers.\n4. Measure customer satisfaction across the user journey.\n5. Offer self-serve support to remove friction and improve customer experience.\n6. Track in-app customer behavior to identify at-risk customers.\n7. Collect feedback from churned customers to understand what went wrong.\n\nEnsure to regularly track churn rates (monthly is ideal). This will enable you to make data-driven decisions that proactively prevent churn among new and existing users. Userpilot can help with that. Our platform lets you understand churn through user behavior tracking and in-app surveys and triggers customized product experiences to drive retention.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Quarterly non-GAAP net income declined 11% year-over-year to RMB24.42 billion.\nAlibaba increased its capital expenditure on Alibaba Cloud infrastructure and its Chinese and cross-border e-commerce businesses, leading to double-digit growth across key metrics including gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that our strategies are working and we are returning to growth,\u201d said Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.\nThe company also announced a $4.0 billion dividend distribution to continuously enhance shareholder return.\nAlibaba\u2019s e-commerce businesses recorded an uptick in purchasing frequency and customer retention over the quarter, even as retail growth slowed in China.\nAcross the country, total retail sales of consumer goods in March grew 3.1% year-over-year, trailing the 5.5% and 7.4% growth recorded in the January-February and December periods, respectively, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.\nDespite the broader slowdown, revenue during the latest quarter grew 4% year-on-year to RMB93.22 billion at Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG).\nTTG\u2019s adjusted EBITA shrank slightly to RMB38.5 billion compared to RMB39.04 billion in the same quarter of 2023, as the business increased strategic investment in areas including customer service, membership program benefits and technology.\n\u201cOur China and international commerce businesses realized double-digit year-over-year GMV growth through our focus on the customer experience,\u201d said Wu, who stepped into the role of Taobao and Tmall Group CEO last year.\nHe has emphasized that 2024 would be a year of strategic upgrades and significant investment into the core businesses, and it has started to bear fruit.\nOnline gross merchandise value \u2013 excluding unpaid orders \u2013 and order growth expanded by double-digits year-over-year, fueling a 5% increase in customer management revenue.\nMembership in TTG\u2019s 88VIP loyalty program increased by double digits year-over-year in the quarter to top 35 million members, as consumers were enticed by improving service and more benefits.\nTaobao has introduced more user-friendly measures including a simplified 6.18 sales structure and a website update. Likewise, Tmall announced plans to triple the scale of resources dedicated to new products.\nBetween January and March, the number of new merchants on Tmall rose 60% year-over-year, while the total transaction volume of new merchants over this time increased by 150% compared with last year.\nQuarterly revenue from the company\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group rose 3% to RMB25.60 billion, driven by the double-digit growth of its public cloud business.\nAlibaba Cloud\u2019s public cloud offerings are available online for organizations and individuals alike, and include elastic compute, database and AI products and services. The company saw triple-digit growth in AI-related revenue in the fourth quarter.\nTo attract start-ups and small businesses that will support long-term growth, Alibaba recently slashed the price of over 100 core public cloud products in the Chinese market.\nIn April, the company also extended these cost reductions to international customers, with an average price reduction of 23%.\n\u201cWe are excited by the accelerated growth of customers and cloud computing revenues related to our AI products. We will remain focused on our strategic priorities and capture future growth opportunities,\u201d said Wu.\nOver 90,000 enterprises have adopted Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen large language model (LLM) since it debuted a year ago, on top of more than 7 million downloads on open-source platforms like Github.\nAlibaba Cloud recently launched a service to help companies customize and scale generative AI models, from consolidating multiple models to optimizing underlying infrastructure resources.\nIn addition, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI-driven sustainability platform Energy Expert rolled out an open API service enabling developers to build customized sustainability applications.\nIts AI computing platform for high-performance computing tasks, PAI-Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service, became available in Singapore for the first time this year.\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) marketplaces notched a 20% increase in combined orders for the latest quarter as revenue grew 45% year-over-year to RMB27.45 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nCross-border retail platform AliExpress provides price-competitive products and efficient fulfillment under its Choice service, which accounted for around 70% of AliExpress\u2019s total orders in April 2024.\nIncreased synergies between AliExpress and Cainiao led five to ten-day delivery completion rates to double year-over-year for Choice orders over the quarter.\nCainiao, which withdrew its plan to make an initial public offering on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange in March partly to focus on supporting cross-border fulfillment services within AIDC, has also gone from strength to strength.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue from Cainiao grew 30% year-over-year to RMB24.56 billion. Cainiao\u2019s five to ten-day delivery service extended into four additional countries during the quarter, bringing the number of countries covered by the premium service to 14.\nInvestment in cross-border initiatives ramped up across the board in the fourth quarter.\nTurkish online retailer Trendyol expanded into the Gulf region and has become one of the region\u2019s most downloaded e-commerce apps. At the same time, AliExpress earmarked millions of euros for discounts and deals as part of an exclusive global sponsorship of the upcoming UEFA European Football Championship set for this summer.\nAs a result of increased investment in key markets to enhance customer experience and expand consumer base, AIDC posted a loss of RMB4.09 billion in the quarter for adjusted EBITA.\nAs part of management\u2019s commitment to delivering value to shareholders, Alibaba has announced a two-part dividend worth an aggregate $4.0 billion.\nThe Alibaba board approved an annual regular cash dividend for the most recent fiscal year and an extraordinary cash dividend comprised of proceeds from the disposition of certain financial investments.\nThe one-time extraordinary dividend will come to $0.0825 per ordinary share or $0.66 per ADS and will be paid in U.S. dollars to holders of ordinary shares and ADSs as of the close of business on June 13, 2024, Hong Kong Time and New York Time, respectively.\n\u201cWe are committed to continuing to return value to our shareholders,\u201d said Alibaba\u2019s Xu.\nEarlier this year, the group said it would begin voluntary updates on its share repurchase program to increase transparency for investors.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Alibaba repurchased 1.25 billion ordinary shares for a total of $12.5 billion, including 524 million ordinary shares repurchased in its fourth fiscal quarter.\nAlibaba\u2019s total shareholder yield, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, led its large-cap peers by reaching 6.5% during the 2023 calendar year.\nThe holding company, which made its 2014 stock market debut in New York and completed a secondary listing in Hong Kong in 2019, is also in the midst of preparations for a dual-primary listing on the two bourses slated for the end of August 2024.",

This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\nMORE: How to sell on eBay and make money\neBay Seller Statistics\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\neCommerce\u2019s Share of Total Retail Sales in the US\nMORE: eBay vacation mode\neBay Advertising Statistics\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\nMORE: How to set up an eBay store\neBay Buyer Statistics\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\nMORE: How to issue partial refund on eBay\nHow Many People Use eBay\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\nNumber of eBay total active buyers from 1st Quarter 2010 to 2nd Quarter 2023 (in millions)\nA Shift After 2018\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\nMORE: eBay seller help\nMORE: eBay refurbished\neBay Website Traffic Share\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States.

An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\nMORE: eBay selling tips\nMORE: eBay selling limits\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023.

Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend. Thus, sellers need a strategic, adaptive, and diversified approach to maximize their reach and sales in this ever-evolving market.\nMORE: Discover Amazon Statistics.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nHow popular is eBay now?\nWhat age group uses eBay the most?\nIs eBay getting less popular?\nWho is eBay's target audience?\nWho is the #1 seller on eBay?\nAuthor\nDominika Kaminska\nAmazing content you need, amazing content we deliver.

Learn about our fact-checking process.\n\nWhether you\u2019re already an eBay seller or only thinking about selling on eBay occasionally, statistics are a sure way to prove which direction is best to consider for your online store. Today, we will delve deep into eBay revenue throughout the years, eBay sales statistics by category, and much more.\n\nWhen Was eBay Established?\n\nEstablished in 1995 as a platform for auction-style sales, eBay swiftly expanded its horizons, becoming a global marketplace for both new and second-hand items. Today, its influence stretches across continents, reaching millions of buyers and sellers alike. The statistics provided in this article are intended to give eBay sellers insight into potential eBay selling opportunities.\n\nMake Money Selling on eBay!\n\neBay Statistic Overview\n\nOnline marketplaces have revolutionized the way we shop, offering a wide array of products at our fingertips. A recent study by Statista sheds light on the dominance and reach of these platforms in the U.S. market as of April 2023.\n\nAmazon is at the top of the list, with a whopping 58.03% share of online visits. Trailing behind, but still maintaining a strong presence, is eBay with a 13.11% share. The results demonstrate eBay\u2019s enduring relevance, even in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.\n\nWalmart also maintains its lead in the online market with a 6.53% share, demonstrating its successful transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a significant online player. Etsy, known for unique and handmade items, accounted for 5.02% of visits. Lastly, Target, another retail giant, holds a 2.64% share, underscoring its efforts to boost its online footprint. These eBay stats emphasize the competitive nature of online retail and highlight the importance of innovation and customer engagement in retaining and growing market share.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for eBay Sellers?\n\nFirst and foremost, despite the towering presence of Amazon, eBay still commands a respectable 13.11% share of online visits as of April 2023. This indicates that eBay remains a formidable platform with a vast and engaged customer base. Sellers can leverage this large audience to diversify their online presence and reach a different segment of buyers.\n\nHowever, the competition is fierce. With Amazon dominating the market, eCommerce sellers must bring their A-game when listing on eBay. This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\n\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\n\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\n\neBay Seller Statistics\n\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\n\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\n\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\n\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\n\neBay Advertising Statistics\n\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\n\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\n\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\n\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\n\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\n\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\n\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\n\neBay Buyer Statistics\n\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\n\nHow Many People Use eBay\n\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\n\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\n\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\n\nA Shift After 2018\n\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\n\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\n\neBay Website Traffic Share\n\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States. Of these U.S. eBay visitors, 54 percent favored using desktop devices to access the site. However, in other examined countries, most users showed a preference for mobile browsing.\n\neBay\u2019s Second-Hand Purchase Trend\n\nAnother important buyer statistic is the share of eBay buyers purchasing second-hand goods in order to save money in 2022.\n\nThe appeal of online marketplaces like eBay is frequently based on the diverse range of products they offer, which varies from brand-new items to second-hand or used goods. An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\n\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\n\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\n\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\n\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\n\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023. During the observed time frame, the highest monthly downloads worldwide occurred in January 2021, reaching 3.4 million for that month.\n\neBay Sales Statistics by Category\n\nIn February 2021, nearly a year after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable face masks dominated eBay sales, averaging over 293 items sold for each listing every week. Mobile phones and smartphones also ranked high in sales, with listings selling an average of 76 units weekly.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIn the rapidly shifting eCommerce landscape, sellers must remain agile and informed. Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\n\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend. Thus, sellers need a strategic, adaptive, and diversified approach to maximize their reach and sales in this ever-evolving market.",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

    "Document2": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\u00a0\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\u00a0\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\r\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\r\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

Although Shopify believes that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, they may prove to be incorrect, and readers cannot be assured that actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control, including but not limited to: sustaining our rapid growth; managing our growth; our potential inability to compete successfully against current and future competitors; the security of personal information we store relating to merchants and their buyers, as well as consumers with whom we have a direct relationship including users of our apps; a cyberattack or security breach; our ability to innovate; the impact of worldwide economic conditions, particularly softening economic growth in key regions including Europe and the United States, including the resulting effect on spending by small and medium-sized businesses or their buyers; our current reliance on a few suppliers to provide the technology we offer through Shopify Payments; the reliance of our business, including the services we provide to merchants, in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties; our limited operating history in new and developing markets and new geographic regions; international sales and operations and the use of our platform in various countries; our potential inability to hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including key personnel; our reliance on third-party cloud providers to deliver our services; complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide; our dependence on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key employees; payments processed through Shopify Payments, Shop Pay Installments, or payments processed or funds managed through Shopify Balance; our potential failure to effectively maintain, promote and enhance our brand; our history of losses and our efforts to maintain profitability; serious errors or defects in our software or hardware; evolving privacy laws and regulations, cross-border data transfer restrictions, data localization requirements and other domestic or foreign regulations that may limit the use and adoption of our services; acquisitions and investments, including strategic investments and fluctuations in our share of income and loss from equity method investment; risks associated with Shopify Capital, and offering financing to merchants; our potential inability to achieve or maintain data transmission capacity; potential claims by third parties of intellectual property infringement or other third party or governmental claims, litigation, disputes, or other proceedings; activities of merchants or partners or the content of merchants' shops and our ability to detect and address unauthorized activity on our platform; unanticipated changes in tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns; being required to collect federal, state, provincial or local business taxes, sales and use taxes or other indirect taxes in additional jurisdictions on transactions by our merchants; changes to technologies used in our platform or new versions or upgrades of operating systems and internet browsers; our potential inability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information or prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our technology; our pricing decisions and changes to our pricing models for our solutions; our use of open source software; seasonal fluctuations in our operating results; exchange rate fluctuations that may negatively affect our results of operations; our dependence upon buyers' and merchants' access to, and willingness to use, the internet for commerce; provisions of our financial instruments including our convertible notes; our potential inability to raise additional funds as may be needed to pursue our growth strategy or continue our operations, on favorable terms or at all; our tax loss carryforwards; the ownership of our shares; our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting; the perceived impact of a return on investment without issuing a dividend; our status as a foreign private issuer and the laws applicable to us as a foreign private issuer; the impact of provisions of Canadian law applicable to us; provisions of our constating documents and charter documents; and other events and factors disclosed previously and from time to time in Shopify's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the securities commissions or similar securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces or territories of Canada.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\n\nShopify Inc.\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\nShopify Inc.\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\nShopify Inc.\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\n\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\n\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates. The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

    "Document2": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

    "Summarized_Document2": "The Etsy marketplace, founded in 2005, connects buyers with makers, artists, designers, and crafters selling unique handmade, originally designed, or specially-selected vintage items. However, as the seller community grew and inventory expanded globally, the marketplace became cluttered with goods that didn't meet Etsy's handmade criteria. In response, Etsy is doubling down on its founding mission to 'keep commerce human,' as stated by CEO Josh Silverman. In the first quarter of 2024, Etsy reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sales (GMS) from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Fiscal 2023 also saw a 2% drop in GMS from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, despite an increase in active sellers from 5.4 million to 7 million and a 3% rise in active buyers to 92 million. On a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023. The loss in 2022 was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge related to the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. Etsy ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting 225 employees. Silverman acknowledged the challenging macro and competitive environment, noting that GMS has remained flat since 2021. To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

And other retailers struggled to compete during the summer shopping holiday.\nKey takeaways:\nConsumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, and although year-over-year growth was modest when compared with the performance of prior Prime Days, it was a small uptick over 2022.\nAmazon is No. 3 in Digital Commerce 360\u2019s new\u00a02023 Global Online Marketplaces Report, which ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by 2023 third-party GMV.\nHow much did Amazon make on Prime Day?\nDigital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon\u2019s sales on Prime Day hit $12.90 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 11 and 12. That\u2019s up 6.7% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2022, which ran July 12 and 13. Last year, sales grew 8.1% over the 2021 event to $12.09 billion. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon\u2019s 2020 event.\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event. That\u2019s up from 300 million last year, Amazon says.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nAmazon, No. 1 in the\u00a0Digital Commerce 360 Top 1000, launched Prime Day in July 2015 to celebrate the web behemoth\u2019s 20th year in business, offering deals on a bunch of products to mark the occasion. As the event evolved, Prime Day turned into a highly anticipated summer sale designed to drum up more business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shopping traffic from deal-seeking consumers.\nThe inaugural Prime Day lasted for 24 hours and encompassed nine countries including the U.S. In 2017, the sale was extended for 30 hours and expanded to a few more markets, and in 2018, Prime Day was a 36-hour event. By 2019, Amazon began running its current two-day sale spanning 18 countries. And this year, more than 20 markets participated.\nWith discounts available only to paying members, Prime Day also is a vehicle for Amazon to sign up more consumers for its popular loyalty plan. The $139-a-year or $14.99-a-month Prime membership program offers perks like free one- or two-day shipping, digital photo storage, and video and music streaming.\nOther retailers sales slow on Prime Day\nAmazon isn\u2019t alone in doing big sales on weekdays in July. Many of its top competitors held sales during the same period, with No. 2 Walmart Inc. returning to the promotional holiday this year after sitting out last year.\nHowever, many retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year, according to Digital Commerce 360\u2019s analysis of Similarweb traffic numbers. Last year, for example, Target Corp. (No. 5 in the Top 1000) grew traffic 42.3% over a control period two weeks prior to Prime Day. This year, traffic was up just 26.9%. Costco Wholesale Corp. (No. 6) went from a 24.6% bump last year to 16.7% this year. Best Buy Co. (No. 7), which usually gets huge increases in traffic as shoppers compare prices on big-ticket items, saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year.\nWalmart, which didn\u2019t participate in Prime Day promos last year, saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%. But even Amazon had a smaller increase in traffic compared to the control period, down less than 1% compared to 2022\u2019s bump.\nSome of this is a difference in promo strategy. Retailers were heavily promotional during the 4th of July holiday period this year, with more offering Independence Day sales than competing with Prime Day. Also, top competitors offered week-long sales, meaning shoppers could focus on Amazon during its two-day sale and turn to Target, Walmart and Costco afterward to pick up other deals.\nFor the full week, Target\u2019s bump was still lower than last year, but the decline was much softer, with an 18.6% decline for the week compared to a 36.5% decline for the two-day period. Walmart\u2019s bump similarly grew when looking at the full week, up 56.0% for the week compared to a 49.2% increase for the two-day period.\nHow we got here\nHere are some insights that helped Digital Commerce 360 derive its Amazon Prime Day sales estimates:\nConsumer spending up on Amazon during Prime Day\nAccording to figures from a Numerator panel, Prime Day shoppers\u2019 spending on the site went up in 2023. The firm derives its insights from purchasing patterns on the Amazon platform. For the full 48-hour period, the average order value registered $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\nUS Ecommerce: Poised for Takeoff? Insights from Digital Commerce 360\nNumerator data is based on 98,462 Prime Day orders placed through Amazon and spanning 34,185 unique households as well as a survey of more than 4,200 verified buyers.\nOutside of Amazon, sales weren\u2019t so rosy. Salesforce says non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second, with average discounts dropping to 18% this year compared to 30% last year.\u00a0According to the Commerce Cloud provider, discounting was higher during the 4th of July period, peaking at 25% on the holiday.\nStill, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, according to Adobe Analytics. The insights arm of technology company Adobe Inc. said U.S. ecommerce sales hit $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data of 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and 100 million SKUs.\nAmazon said the first day of the sales event marked its largest single-day sales ever.\nMerchants weigh in\nAndrey Klen is pleased with how things went for his company on Amazon.com during Prime Day this year. The co-founder and chief marketing officer of Petcube said \u201cPrime Day performed much better in comparison to the previous year. Compared to an average day, we\u2019ve seen a double-digit multiple on sales. We were able to beat optimistic high growth projections on our main product.\u201d\nKlen said sales numbers suggest that shoppers were excited about Prime Day this year and had planned purchases of Petcube products well in advance of the two-day sales event.\n\u201cWe had lower conversion a couple of days prior to Prime Day, followed by the massive explosion for the first hours on the date. Most likely, people were adding the products to the cart beforehand,\u201d Klen said.\nThrasio Holdings Inc., an investment company that has purchased a number of Amazon merchants, said some of its brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\u201cThese were the two most profitable days in Thrasio history,\u201d Thrasio CEO\u00a0Greg Greeley said in a written statement.\nThrasio\u2019s latest acquisition \u2014 a seller of insect-repellent spray called Ranger Ready Repellents \u2014 had a record-breaking day on Amazon and tripled its Prime Day 2022 sales.\nDo you rank in our databases?\nSubmit your data\u00a0and we\u2019ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\nSign up\nStay on top of the latest developments in the ecommerce industry.

    "Document2": "Alibaba Marketing Strategy 2024: A Case Study\nAlibaba, the leading e-commerce company in China, has revolutionized the industry with its cutting-edge marketing strategy. By focusing on customer acquisition, market segmentation, and brand positioning, Alibaba has established a dominant presence in the e-commerce landscape. With its comprehensive approach, the company excels in both the B2B and B2C markets, catering to businesses of all sizes and individual consumers.\nOne of the key factors behind Alibaba\u2019s success is its digital marketing solutions, which include SEO, online advertising, and social media marketing. By leveraging these tools, Alibaba drives brand promotion and boosts sales, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of the industry. The company\u2019s commitment to customer acquisition and market segmentation has solidified its position as a leader in the e-commerce space.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have enabled it to compete with international e-commerce giants. With a network that reaches over 150 countries in the global logistics industry, Alibaba has formed partnerships with companies in retail, logistics, and technology sectors to reach more consumers and offer a wider range of products and services.\nFurthermore, Alibaba\u2019s brand positioning efforts through online advertising have helped it become a trusted and reliable partner for businesses and consumers. The company\u2019s innovative tactics, such as the annual November 11 sale, have played a significant role in generating record-breaking revenues. In fact, Alibaba earned $14.3 billion (\u20ac13.45 billion) revenue in just 24 hours, making it the highest revenue gained in one shopping day worldwide.\nUnder the visionary leadership of CEO Daniel Zhang, Alibaba continues to thrive. With over 24,000 employees in 70 offices worldwide, the company remains committed to its mission of reaching over 500 million consumers in 200 countries.\nKey Takeaways:\nAlibaba\u2019s Dominance in E-commerce\nWhen it comes to e-commerce, Alibaba is a force to be reckoned with. This multinational conglomerate has carved out a dominant position in both the B2B and B2C markets, solidifying its e-commerce dominance in China and beyond.\nAlibaba\u2019s success can be attributed to its customer-centric approach, placing the needs of users at the heart of its strategy. By creating a user-friendly platform, Alibaba has been able to attract and retain a large user base, offering them a seamless shopping experience.\nIn 2014, Alibaba went public with a staggering 83% market share in China\u2019s e-commerce market. Since then, the landscape has changed with the rise of competitors like Pinduoduo and JD.com. However, Alibaba has managed to maintain a significant market share, currently standing at 39.5%. While its market share has decreased, it is still a force to be reckoned with.\nAlibaba\u2019s continuous growth is fueled by its strong performance in the B2B and B2C sectors. One of its key strengths is its well-integrated supply chain, which allows for efficient operations and reduced costs. Moreover, Alibaba\u2019s Chinese e-commerce unit, Taobao & Tmall Group, experienced a 4% growth in revenue during the fourth quarter, demonstrating its resilience in a competitive market.\nTo enhance user experience and stay ahead of the competition, Alibaba focuses on improved product discovery tools and personalized recommendations. This customer-centric approach ensures that users find exactly what they\u2019re looking for, keeping them engaged and satisfied.\nMarket Share Comparison\nExamining the market share landscape, we can see that while Alibaba\u2019s share has decreased, it still maintains a significant lead over its competitors. Pinduoduo has witnessed substantial growth, increasing its market share from 11% to 16% in 2021. Meanwhile, JD.com has remained stable within the range of 16-18%.\nAs Alibaba continues to navigate the ever-changing e-commerce landscape, it faces competition not only from domestic players but also from global giants like Temu and SHEIN. However, Alibaba\u2019s strong brand positioning and global expansion efforts, including its focus on the US market, give it a competitive edge.\nAll in all, Alibaba\u2019s dominance in e-commerce is a result of its customer-centric approach, user-friendly platform, and continuous efforts to enhance the overall shopping experience. With its unwavering focus on innovation and global expansion, Alibaba is set to maintain its position as a leader in the e-commerce industry.\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAs Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce arm, AliExpress, operates in 150 countries, the company has been successful in its global expansion efforts. By forging strategic partnerships and making strategic investments, Alibaba has extended its reach beyond China, aiming to capture new markets and compete with major players like Amazon.\nOne key strategy Alibaba employs in its global expansion is forming strategic partnerships with established brands and companies. For instance, Tmall Luxury Pavilion, launched in 2017, has attracted 80 luxury brands, including Burberry and Versace, to sell their products directly to Chinese consumers. This strategic partnership has allowed Alibaba to tap into the luxury market and cater to the increasing demand for high-end goods in China.\nAnother important aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is its focus on connecting small and medium-sized brands from around the world with Alibaba customers in China. Through Taobao Global, Alibaba partners with these brands, providing them with access to a massive consumer base in China, while also bringing a diverse range of products to Chinese consumers.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not limited to China or Asia. The company has made significant investments in online marketplaces in Southeast Asia, such as Lazada, where Alibaba invested $4 billion. This investment has allowed Alibaba to gain a strong foothold in the Southeast Asian market and expand its global reach.\nAdditionally, Alibaba has acquired e-commerce sites like Daraz in South Asia, made investments in companies like Tokopedia in Indonesia and Paytm in India, and partnered with MegaFon and Russia\u2019s Mail.Ru Group to establish AliExpress Russia. These moves highlight Alibaba\u2019s commitment to expanding its presence in key markets and capitalizing on the growth opportunities they offer.\nCompetitive analysis also plays a crucial role in Alibaba\u2019s global expansion strategy. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of its competitors, such as Amazon and eBay, Alibaba can identify areas for improvement and innovation. This competitive analysis allows Alibaba to stay ahead in the global e-commerce landscape and navigate the challenges posed by regional competitors.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles related to foreign investments, e-commerce, and data privacy pose obstacles that Alibaba must navigate and overcome. Furthermore, competition from global players like Amazon and regional competitors requires Alibaba to invest significantly in customer support and innovation.\nAnother crucial aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is adapting its strategies to local markets and consumer preferences. Navigating cultural differences is vital for Alibaba to succeed in new markets and ensure its strategies resonate with local consumers.\nIn summary, Alibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have been driven by strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and investments in key markets. With its presence in 150 countries, Alibaba is successfully competing with major players in the e-commerce industry. By conducting comprehensive competitive analysis and adapting to local markets, Alibaba continues to expand its global footprint and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce.\nAlibaba\u2019s Brand Positioning\nAlibaba, a global leader in e-commerce, has strategically positioned itself as a trusted and reliable brand through innovative online advertising campaigns. By focusing on building trust and credibility, Alibaba has successfully gained the confidence of businesses and consumers alike.\nOne of Alibaba\u2019s key strengths is its ability to offer a wide range of products and services, ensuring convenience and choice for its customers. With a commitment to innovation, Alibaba continually enhances its platform to provide an unparalleled user experience.\nThe company\u2019s brand positioning is further reinforced by its strong emphasis on trust and credibility. Alibaba\u2019s secure payment options and stringent quality control measures contribute to its reputation as a reliable partner.\nFounder Jack Ma\u2019s significant recognition and popularity have also played a crucial role in building Alibaba\u2019s brand image. His entrepreneurial journey and success have made him a household name, further enhancing the company\u2019s credibility.\nAlibaba\u2019s brand positioning has enabled it to surpass retail giants like Walmart in global sales and achieve the world\u2019s biggest IPO in 2014.

With a strong focus on customer satisfaction and a commitment to innovation, Alibaba is well-positioned for continued growth and success in the future.\nAlibaba\u2019s Leadership Strategies\nAlibaba\u2019s success can be attributed to their effective leadership strategies and the vision of Jack Ma. With a focus on empowering small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Alibaba has positioned itself as a leader in the market.\nUnder Jack Ma\u2019s visionary leadership, Alibaba has constantly adapted to changing market dynamics and embraced innovation. Their ability to navigate cultural differences has allowed them to create tailored experiences for customers in new international markets.\nZhang, the current CEO of Alibaba, has continued the company\u2019s commitment to innovation. He has championed the use of technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence to simplify cross-border transactions, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nOne of Alibaba\u2019s key strategies has been their diverse portfolio, which includes e-commerce, cloud computing, logistics operations, and a stake in Ant Financial. This diverse portfolio values the company at around $130 per share, indicating a potential undervaluation of the stock.\nAlibaba\u2019s leadership strategies have also contributed to their dominance in the Chinese market, where they hold over 50% share. They have surpassed international sales records and forged strategic alliances with global partners, further solidifying their position.\nFinancial Strength and Market Position\nAlibaba\u2019s solid financial position is evident in their cash reserves, which constitute one-third of their $186 billion market value.

These offerings have contributed over 70% to external cloud revenue, showcasing a strong demand for cloud infrastructure and model training services.\nFurthermore, Alibaba\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group recorded a significant 44% surge in adjusted EBITDA, driven by increased revenue from their public cloud products and services. This growth highlights their success in the cloud computing sector.\nAnalyst Perspectives and Recommendations\nWhile Alibaba\u2019s leadership strategies have been instrumental in their success, analysts have raised concerns about the company\u2019s future. Morgan Stanley, for instance, reduced Alibaba\u2019s rating and lowered the price target based on the slower-than-expected recovery and uncertainties surrounding the halt of the cloud business spinoff.\nHowever, portfolio managers recommend maintaining balanced exposure to Chinese stocks, including Alibaba, despite challenges in China\u2019s economic landscape. They highlight the property sector downturn and inflationary pressures as factors to consider.\nAlibaba\u2019s Employee Strength\nAlibaba\u2019s success is further supported by their dedicated workforce. With over 115,000 employees spread across 70 cities, Alibaba has a strong team capable of driving innovation, executing strategies, and delivering exceptional results.\nAlibaba\u2019s leadership strategies, coupled with their financial strength, market position, and dedicated employees, have positioned them as a global leader in e-commerce and technology.

Through their innovative strategies and relentless pursuit of growth, Alibaba has set a benchmark for success in the digital era.\nCustomer-Centric Innovation\nOne of the key lessons from Alibaba\u2019s success is the importance of customer-centric innovation.

Whether it\u2019s the introduction of Alipay, their own payment transfer system, or the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning for personalized marketing, Alibaba consistently puts the customer at the center of their strategy.\nDiversification\nAlibaba\u2019s success can also be attributed to their diversification into various sectors. From cloud computing and digital media to entertainment and finance, Alibaba has expanded beyond e-commerce to tap into new opportunities. This diversification has allowed them to stay ahead of the curve and continually adapt to changing market dynamics.\nEmpowering SMEs\nOne of the distinguishing factors of Alibaba\u2019s success is their commitment to empowering small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

This focus on empowering SMEs has not only accelerated their growth but has also contributed to job creation and economic development.\nGlobal Vision\nAlibaba\u2019s global vision has been instrumental in their rapid expansion and success in international markets.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon nears $13 billion in Prime Day sales\nAmazon boosted its overall Prime Day sales to record numbers, but growth is slowing. Consumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, with a 6.7% year-over-year increase to $12.90 billion globally during the event on July 11 and 12, 2024. This is up from $12.09 billion in 2022 and $11.19 billion in 2021.\n\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities, and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\n\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event, up from 300 million last year. The average order value was $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\n\nOther retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year. For example, Target Corp. grew traffic 26.9% this year compared to 42.3% last year. Costco Wholesale Corp. saw a bump of 16.7% this year compared to 24.6% last year. Best Buy Co. saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year. Walmart saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%.\n\nSales outside of Amazon weren\u2019t as strong. Salesforce reported non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second. However, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, hitting $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data.\n\nMerchants like Petcube and Thrasio Holdings Inc. reported significant sales increases during Prime Day. Petcube saw a double-digit multiple on sales compared to an average day, and Thrasio\u2019s brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\nIn summary, Amazon's Prime Day 2024 had a significant impact on total revenue in July 2024, with nearly $13 billion in sales, marking a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Other retailers experienced mixed results, with some seeing smaller traffic increases and others reporting declines in sales.",

    "Document1": "Ebay Marketing Strategy 2024: A Case Study\nIn recent years, eBay has implemented a comprehensive marketing strategy to drive its success and maintain its position as a leading online marketplace. With a strong focus on customer experience, innovative partnerships, and global expansion, eBay has seen impressive revenue growth and user engagement. In this case study, we will delve into eBay\u2019s marketing approach and examine the key strategies that have contributed to its continued success.\nKey Takeaways:\nWith its impressive financial performance, eBay\u2019s marketing strategy serves as a testament to its ability to adapt and thrive in the ever-evolving e-commerce landscape. In the following sections, we will explore the various facets of eBay\u2019s marketing approach, providing insights and key learnings for businesses looking to enhance their own strategies.\nExamining eBay\u2019s Revenue Model\neBay, one of the world\u2019s leading online marketplaces, operates on a revenue model that incorporates various sources of income. By understanding how eBay generates revenue, we can gain valuable insights into its business strategy and success.\nAt the core of eBay\u2019s revenue model are listing fees and commissions on sales. For every listing, eBay charges a fee of $0.35, following a free limit of 200 products. This scalable approach enables sellers to list their products while generating revenue for the platform. Additionally, eBay earns a commission on sales through a Final Value Fee, which is a percentage of the final sale price, and an additional charge of $0.30 per order.\nAside from listing fees and commissions, eBay also generates revenue through advertising. Sellers have the option to pay advertising fees to promote their products on the platform, providing them with increased visibility and sales opportunities. This advertising revenue stream further supports eBay\u2019s commitment to creating a thriving marketplace for its sellers.\nOver the years, eBay has expanded its revenue streams through strategic acquisitions. Notable acquisitions such as PayPal, Rent.com, Skype, and StubHub have not only diversified eBay\u2019s revenue but also strengthened its position in the market. These acquisitions have allowed eBay to tap into new markets and revenue sources, further fueling its growth and success.\nWith over 19 million sellers worldwide and more than 1 billion active listings, eBay\u2019s revenue model has proven to be highly effective. It has established itself as the world\u2019s second most visited online marketplace, with over 182 million active users globally. eBay\u2019s revenue model, combined with its wide reach and diverse product offerings, has contributed to its impressive financial performance.\nTake a look at the table below for a snapshot of eBay\u2019s revenue statistics:\nWith its successful revenue model and ongoing innovations, eBay continues to solidify its position in the e-commerce industry. The platform\u2019s dedication to providing sellers with a profitable marketplace and buyers with a wide range of products ensures sustainable growth and long-term success.\neBay\u2019s Marketing Approach \u2013 Beyond Online Car Boot Sales\neBay, initially known as AuctionWatch, revolutionized the e-commerce industry when it was founded in 1995 by computer programmer Pierre Omidyar. What started as a platform for online auctions has evolved into much more. Omidyar\u2019s vision extended beyond a simple auction site; he aimed to create an online community that fostered democratic decision-making, decentralized operations, and open communication.\nDespite its success, eBay has faced challenges in recent years. To overcome the perception of being just an \u201conline car boot sale,\u201d the company has shifted its marketing approach. One significant strategy is investing in traditional media advertising, particularly television. eBay recognizes that traditional media is still a powerful channel for brand building and reshaping consumer perceptions.\nThe decision to invest in traditional media advertising aligns with eBay\u2019s goal of reasserting its unique selling position as the site where buyers and sellers can find anything. By utilizing television ads, eBay has the opportunity to reach a wider audience and showcase the diverse range of products available on the platform.\nAlthough digital marketing platforms have gained prominence, traditional media advertising provides eBay with an advantage. While digital ads can be effective in targeting specific audiences, traditional media appeals to a broader demographic. This broader reach allows eBay to engage with potential buyers and sellers who may not be as active online.\nFurthermore, traditional media advertisements can have a lasting impact on brand recall and recognition. Television commercials, in particular, enable eBay to convey its message visually and emotionally, creating a memorable connection with the audience.\nBy diversifying its marketing approach beyond online advertising, eBay aims to broaden its appeal and attract new users. Additionally, by leveraging traditional media, eBay can address the perception that it is inconvenient compared to more streamlined platforms like Amazon and Facebook.\nDespite the challenges eBay faces, its commitment to brand building through traditional media demonstrates its determination to remain a dominant player in the e-commerce industry. Through television advertisements and other traditional media channels, eBay is actively reshaping consumer perceptions and reviving its brand.\n\nImage alt tag: eBay marketing approach\nLeveraging Social Media for Promotion\nSocial media has become an integral part of people\u2019s lives, offering a powerful platform for businesses to promote their products and services. Recognizing the immense potential of social media, eBay has implemented a program to incentivize sellers to leverage social media platforms for promotion.\nThe eBay social media promotion program provides sellers with the opportunity to reduce their fees for successful sales generated through social links. By actively promoting their listings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, sellers can reach a broader audience and increase their chances of making sales.\nWith 98% of digital consumers being active on social media and 74% of people trusting social media when making purchasing decisions, it is evident that social sharing plays a significant role in driving sales and brand visibility. By encouraging sellers to utilize social media as a promotional tool, eBay aims to enhance the visibility of listings and attract potential buyers.\nThis initiative has proven to be successful, with a notable increase in sales resulting from social media promotion. As a result, eBay plans to expand this program to other markets worldwide, allowing sellers from different regions to benefit from this incentivized social sharing approach.\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s collaboration with influencers on platforms like Instagram has also contributed to increased visibility and sales. With over a billion monthly active users on Instagram and influencer posts generating an average engagement rate of 3.21%, leveraging the reach and influence of social media influencers has become an effective marketing strategy.\n\nSocial Media: A Game Changer for eBay\nSocial media has transformed the way businesses promote and sell their products, and eBay is leveraging this trend to enhance its visibility and drive sales. By incentivizing sellers to promote their listings on social media platforms, eBay is tapping into a vast audience and creating new opportunities for sellers to succeed.\nCollaborations and Influencer Marketing\neBay recognizes the immense power of influencer marketing and the impact it can have on driving brand awareness and increasing product visibility. In an effort to tap into this growing trend, eBay has ventured into exciting collaborations, including a groundbreaking partnership with the hit reality TV show Love Island.\nLove Island, with its massive viewership of 3.2 million during the live final in 2021, offers a great opportunity for eBay to reach a wide audience and promote their commitment to sustainability in the fashion industry. As a new sponsor of Love Island, eBay has taken on the responsibility of replacing fast fashion brands with a focus on second-hand clothing and encouraging viewers to embrace pre-loved fashion.\nThis collaboration enables eBay to leverage the influence of Love Island contestants and popular influencers to advocate for sustainable fashion choices. By working with influencers and bloggers, eBay can enhance its brand awareness and credibility, as well as drive traffic and conversions to their platform.\nThrough collaborations with influencers, eBay can tap into their loyal following on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. By partnering with these individuals, eBay can harness their influence to establish long-term relationships with their target audience, as well as foster trust and credibility.\nProduct reviews, giveaways, and content collaborations are some of the key strategies used in influencer marketing. Influencers not only provide valuable reviews of eBay products, but they also promote specific actions from their audience, such as engaging with the brand or making a purchase, in exchange for free merchandise.\neBay\u2019s collaborations and influencer marketing efforts are driven by the goal of raising brand awareness and increasing reach. As more than 75% of marketing professionals plan to invest in influencer marketing, eBay is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and achieve their marketing objectives.\nEbay Collaborations with Love Island Contestants\nIn the Love Island collaboration, eBay has partnered with contestants who have a significant influence on social media. These collaborations involve contestants creating and sharing content on their platforms, showcasing their personal style through second-hand clothing and promoting eBay\u2019s range of pre-loved fashion items.\nThis strategic partnership not only benefits eBay by increasing brand visibility, but it also aligns with the rising popularity of pre-loved clothing apps like Vinted, Depop, and Hardly Ever Worn. By associating with Love Island and sustainable fashion choices, eBay can appeal to a broader audience seeking more ethical and environmentally friendly options.\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s collaboration with Love Island contestants and influencers is not limited to the duration of the show. It\u2019s a long-term relationship-building approach, establishing authenticity and trust among the audience. The ongoing engagement helps eBay maintain a strong presence in the minds of their target market, leading to increased conversions and higher customer satisfaction.\nAs eBay continues to innovate and explore new avenues for collaboration and influencer marketing, they remain committed to their overarching goals of sustainability, brand awareness, and credibility.\nUsing Legacy Media for Marketing\nWhile digital advertising dominates the marketing landscape, eBay understands the enduring power of legacy media in reaching a wide audience. One such medium that eBay has leveraged effectively is television advertising.\nTelevision remains a formidable platform for brand building and shaping consumer perceptions. With its broad reach and ability to captivate audiences, TV advertising allows eBay to communicate its key messages to a diverse range of potential buyers.\nDespite the rise of digital channels, TV advertising continues to play a significant role in eBay\u2019s marketing strategy. By utilizing legacy media like TV, eBay can complement its digital efforts and extend its reach to a wider audience.\neBay\u2019s decision to incorporate TV advertising into its marketing mix is supported by its success in other areas. For example, eBay\u2019s promoted listings revenue increased by an impressive 27% to $276 million, outpacing GMV growth by more than 30 points. This achievement demonstrates the effectiveness of eBay\u2019s marketing approach, which combines digital advertising with legacy media.\nMoreover, eBay\u2019s transition from display advertising to promoted listings and CPC ads has yielded positive results, especially when compared to its legacy third-party display ads. While eBay faced industry-wide headwinds with its legacy third-party display ads, these ads represent a smaller portion of its overall advertising mix.\neBay\u2019s emphasis on legacy media like TV advertising is part of its broader marketing strategy to diversify sales channels and reach target audiences effectively. By utilizing both digital and traditional advertising platforms, eBay can leverage its buying intent signals, shopping insights, and transaction-level data to connect brands with their ideal customers.\nAs a testament to the success of eBay\u2019s marketing efforts, over 2 million sellers utilized at least one ad product in Q4, and eBay has over 800,000 sellers promoting over 200 million listings. Promoted listings on eBay have provided sellers with an average boost in visibility of 36% and led to impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 110%.\nAlthough digital advertising has gained significant traction, eBay\u2019s strategic use of legacy media, particularly TV advertising, ensures the company\u2019s marketing efforts are comprehensive and well-rounded. By incorporating legacy media into its marketing mix, eBay continues to connect with a wide range of buyers and create meaningful brand experiences.\neBay\u2019s Approach to Inventory Sourcing\neBay provides sellers with a unique opportunity to expand their product selection through inventory sourcing from government agencies. This enables sellers to find a wide range of unique and in-demand items that can attract buyers and drive sales.\nWith over 1.5 billion listings on the eBay platform and 154 million active buyers worldwide, sellers need to stand out from the competition. Sourcing inventory from government agencies allows sellers to offer products that may not be readily available elsewhere, giving them a competitive edge.\nGovernment agencies often have surplus items or products seized in legal cases that they need to sell. These items can include electronics, vehicles, clothing, and much more. By partnering with government agencies, eBay sellers can access these items and offer them to buyers on the platform.\nWhen sourcing inventory from government agencies, sellers should consider the following:\neBay\u2019s extensive buyer base and powerful search algorithm prioritize relevant results from top sellers. By sourcing inventory from government agencies, sellers can offer unique products that align with the needs and interests of eBay\u2019s diverse community of buyers.\nBy leveraging eBay\u2019s inventory sourcing from government agencies, sellers can enhance their product range, attract more buyers, and increase sales on the platform. It\u2019s an excellent strategy for sellers looking to differentiate themselves and offer unique products that meet the diverse needs of eBay\u2019s global community.\nBest Practices for Customer Service\neBay, with its bustling marketplace and millions of buyers and sellers, understands the crucial role that customer service plays in building trust and cultivating repeat business relationships. Implementing best practices for customer service can lead to enhanced customer satisfaction, improved sales conversion rates, and increased buyer loyalty.\nAccurate Handling Times and Uploading Tracking Information\nStatistics show that providing accurate handling times and uploading tracking information can significantly reduce \u201citem not received\u201d claims, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. By promptly shipping orders and providing tracking details, sellers can create a positive shopping experience and instill confidence in buyers.\nGenerous Returns Policy\nResearch indicates that having a generous returns policy can increase sales conversion rates. Shoppers are more likely to purchase items when they know they can be returned if needed. By offering hassle-free returns, sellers demonstrate their commitment to customer satisfaction and build trust with buyers.\nClear and Accurate Product Listings\nData suggests that clear and accurate product listings, including detailed descriptions and high-quality images, can reduce buyer dissatisfaction and lead to fewer return requests. Sellers should provide comprehensive information about their products, ensuring that buyers have a clear understanding of what they are purchasing.\nRequiring Immediate Payment\nStudies have shown that requiring immediate payment for listings helps prevent unpaid items and reduces the likelihood of payment disputes. This streamlined buying process benefits both sellers and buyers, allowing transactions to be completed smoothly and efficiently.\nPromptly Managing Buyers\u2019 Requests and Resolving Disputes\nAnalytics demonstrate that efficiently managing buyers\u2019 requests and resolving disputes promptly can enhance customer satisfaction levels and cultivate repeat business relationships. By addressing buyer inquiries and issues in a timely manner, sellers demonstrate their dedication to providing excellent customer service.\nExceptional customer service is key on eBay. Promptly responding to inquiries, offering hassle-free return policies, and providing transparent updates on order status can foster trust and loyalty with buyers. By prioritizing customer satisfaction and communication, sellers can differentiate themselves and establish a positive reputation on the platform.\neBay provides various selling tools for free to help sellers manage and promote listings, track sales performance, and analyze customer behavior. Leveraging these tools can assist sellers in delivering exceptional customer service and making dynamic strategy adjustments based on customer insights.\nCultivating a positive seller reputation through responsive communication, transparency, and issue resolution further helps establish trust with buyers. Sellers should strive to provide accurate and helpful information, address buyer concerns promptly, and proactively resolve any issues that may arise.\nBy cross-promoting related listings and encouraging additional sales, sellers can leverage eBay\u2019s platform to their advantage. This strategy not only increases customer interest but also strengthens customer loyalty by offering a seamless shopping experience.\nFurthermore, with mobile shopping on the rise, it is crucial for sellers to ensure that their listings are mobile-friendly. Responsive designs, fast loading speeds, and targeted promotions for mobile users can enhance the shopping experience and drive sales.\nIn conclusion, implementing best practices for customer service is essential for success on eBay. By prioritizing accurate handling times, clear and accurate product listings, prompt communication, and efficient dispute resolution, sellers can enhance customer satisfaction, build buyer loyalty, and foster long-term success on the platform.\neBay Marketing Grants and Support\neBay understands the challenges faced by entrepreneurs and small businesses, and that\u2019s why they have developed the eBay Up & Running Grants program. Now in its 5th year, this program aims to provide vital support to sellers on the platform, empowering them to grow their businesses and achieve long-term success.\nThrough the eBay Up & Running Grants program, 50 U.S. eBay sellers are rewarded with $10,000 each.

Since then, the landscape has changed with the rise of competitors like Pinduoduo and JD.com. However, Alibaba has managed to maintain a significant market share, currently standing at 39.5%. While its market share has decreased, it is still a force to be reckoned with.\nAlibaba\u2019s continuous growth is fueled by its strong performance in the B2B and B2C sectors. One of its key strengths is its well-integrated supply chain, which allows for efficient operations and reduced costs. Moreover, Alibaba\u2019s Chinese e-commerce unit, Taobao & Tmall Group, experienced a 4% growth in revenue during the fourth quarter, demonstrating its resilience in a competitive market.\nTo enhance user experience and stay ahead of the competition, Alibaba focuses on improved product discovery tools and personalized recommendations. This customer-centric approach ensures that users find exactly what they\u2019re looking for, keeping them engaged and satisfied.\nMarket Share Comparison\nExamining the market share landscape, we can see that while Alibaba\u2019s share has decreased, it still maintains a significant lead over its competitors. Pinduoduo has witnessed substantial growth, increasing its market share from 11% to 16% in 2021. Meanwhile, JD.com has remained stable within the range of 16-18%.\nAs Alibaba continues to navigate the ever-changing e-commerce landscape, it faces competition not only from domestic players but also from global giants like Temu and SHEIN. However, Alibaba\u2019s strong brand positioning and global expansion efforts, including its focus on the US market, give it a competitive edge.\nAll in all, Alibaba\u2019s dominance in e-commerce is a result of its customer-centric approach, user-friendly platform, and continuous efforts to enhance the overall shopping experience. With its unwavering focus on innovation and global expansion, Alibaba is set to maintain its position as a leader in the e-commerce industry.\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAs Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce arm, AliExpress, operates in 150 countries, the company has been successful in its global expansion efforts. By forging strategic partnerships and making strategic investments, Alibaba has extended its reach beyond China, aiming to capture new markets and compete with major players like Amazon.\nOne key strategy Alibaba employs in its global expansion is forming strategic partnerships with established brands and companies. For instance, Tmall Luxury Pavilion, launched in 2017, has attracted 80 luxury brands, including Burberry and Versace, to sell their products directly to Chinese consumers. This strategic partnership has allowed Alibaba to tap into the luxury market and cater to the increasing demand for high-end goods in China.\nAnother important aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is its focus on connecting small and medium-sized brands from around the world with Alibaba customers in China. Through Taobao Global, Alibaba partners with these brands, providing them with access to a massive consumer base in China, while also bringing a diverse range of products to Chinese consumers.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not limited to China or Asia. The company has made significant investments in online marketplaces in Southeast Asia, such as Lazada, where Alibaba invested $4 billion. This investment has allowed Alibaba to gain a strong foothold in the Southeast Asian market and expand its global reach.\nAdditionally, Alibaba has acquired e-commerce sites like Daraz in South Asia, made investments in companies like Tokopedia in Indonesia and Paytm in India, and partnered with MegaFon and Russia\u2019s Mail.Ru Group to establish AliExpress Russia. These moves highlight Alibaba\u2019s commitment to expanding its presence in key markets and capitalizing on the growth opportunities they offer.\nCompetitive analysis also plays a crucial role in Alibaba\u2019s global expansion strategy. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of its competitors, such as Amazon and eBay, Alibaba can identify areas for improvement and innovation. This competitive analysis allows Alibaba to stay ahead in the global e-commerce landscape and navigate the challenges posed by regional competitors.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles related to foreign investments, e-commerce, and data privacy pose obstacles that Alibaba must navigate and overcome. Furthermore, competition from global players like Amazon and regional competitors requires Alibaba to invest significantly in customer support and innovation.\nAnother crucial aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is adapting its strategies to local markets and consumer preferences. Navigating cultural differences is vital for Alibaba to succeed in new markets and ensure its strategies resonate with local consumers.\nIn summary, Alibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have been driven by strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and investments in key markets. With its presence in 150 countries, Alibaba is successfully competing with major players in the e-commerce industry. By conducting comprehensive competitive analysis and adapting to local markets, Alibaba continues to expand its global footprint and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce.\nAlibaba\u2019s Brand Positioning\nAlibaba, a global leader in e-commerce, has strategically positioned itself as a trusted and reliable brand through innovative online advertising campaigns.

Alibaba\u2019s secure payment options and stringent quality control measures contribute to its reputation as a reliable partner.\nFounder Jack Ma\u2019s significant recognition and popularity have also played a crucial role in building Alibaba\u2019s brand image. His entrepreneurial journey and success have made him a household name, further enhancing the company\u2019s credibility.\nAlibaba\u2019s brand positioning has enabled it to surpass retail giants like Walmart in global sales and achieve the world\u2019s biggest IPO in 2014. Today, the company holds a place within the global top 10 market cap.\nTo support its brand positioning, Alibaba has expanded its operations into major global markets, allowing it to reach a larger customer base. The company\u2019s presence in nearly 240 countries worldwide is a testament to its global dominance.\nTo visually represent Alibaba\u2019s brand positioning, the image below showcases the company\u2019s logo, embodying trust, innovation, and credibility:\nIn conclusion, Alibaba has successfully positioned itself as a trusted and innovative brand through strategic online advertising campaigns.

This case study delves into eBay\u2019s marketing approach, examining key strategies that have contributed to its continued success. eBay\u2019s revenue model incorporates listing fees, commissions on sales, and advertising revenue. The platform charges a $0.35 fee per listing after a free limit of 200 products and earns a commission through a Final Value Fee and an additional $0.30 per order.

The company has invested in traditional media advertising, particularly television, to reshape consumer perceptions and reach a broader audience. This strategy aims to reassert eBay\u2019s unique selling position as a diverse marketplace. Traditional media advertising complements digital marketing by appealing to a wider demographic and enhancing brand recall. eBay\u2019s social media promotion program incentivizes sellers to promote their listings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, reducing fees for successful sales generated through social links. This initiative has led to increased sales and visibility, with plans to expand globally. Collaborations with influencers and reality TV shows like Love Island have further boosted eBay\u2019s brand awareness and commitment to sustainability. eBay\u2019s use of legacy media, such as television advertising, remains a significant part of its marketing strategy. This approach has proven effective, with promoted listings revenue increasing by 27% to $276 million. eBay\u2019s marketing efforts combine digital and traditional advertising to reach a wide audience and create meaningful brand experiences. eBay also offers sellers opportunities to source inventory from government agencies, providing unique and in-demand items that attract buyers. Best practices for customer service, such as accurate handling times, generous returns policies, and clear product listings, enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. The eBay Up & Running Grants program supports small businesses with financial assistance and educational resources. In 2023, eBay awarded over $500,000 in grants and education resources to small businesses. eBay\u2019s international expansion and shipping solutions enable sellers to reach buyers in over 200 countries, reducing risks and costs associated with global transactions. Continuous improvement and seller education are key to success on eBay. The platform provides valuable resources and tools to help sellers optimize their performance and stay ahead of the competition. eBay\u2019s marketing strategy has been instrumental in its success, combining traditional and digital channels to reach its target audience and build a strong reputation.

    "Document2": "UT Austin Enrolls Largest-Ever Student Body, Sets All-Time Highs for Graduation Rates\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 This fall, The University of Texas at Austin has admitted its largest-ever incoming class and enrolled more students than ever before. The university has 9,109 first-time, first-year undergraduates, according to data collected on the 12th class day of the current fall term, surpassing the record high from the previous year of 9,060. Total university enrollment rose to 52,384, surpassing the all-time high of 52,261 set in 2002.\u00a0\nThe increases, which followed another year of strong application numbers, were made possible in large part by the university\u2019s continued commitment to improving four- and six-year graduation rates, where UT Austin once again set all-time highs in both categories. The four-year rate rose to 73.5% this year, an increase of 21 percentage points since 2012, while the six-year rate rose to 87.8%, a gain of nine percentage points during the past decade.\u00a0\nGraduation rates at UT have shown consistent improvement since 2011, when the university set a goal of increasing the four-year graduation rate from 52% to 70%. Beginning in 2012-2013, the university implemented campus-wide student success programs and analyzed student data to provide proactive support for students to help them define and stick with a path toward graduation. The programs offer peer mentoring, academic support and scholarship access to help more incoming students succeed in college.\u00a0\n\u201cYear after year, increasingly more of the most outstanding students from across Texas and beyond want to enroll at our world-class university,\u201d said UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. \u201cImproved graduation rates reduce students\u2019 expenses and allow them to generate income sooner, while also expanding opportunities for incoming students who seek the rigorous education and vibrant college experience that UT offers.\u201d\u00a0\nThe university is also welcoming more first-generation and historically underrepresented groups than ever, while continuing to serve some of its highest numbers of students eligible for Pell grants, which are available to low-income families. Once in the classroom, these students are following the university\u2019s overall trends, performing at consistently higher levels relative to the university\u2019s historical norms. Four-year graduation rates for Black, Hispanic, first-generation and Pell-eligible students have increased, on average, by 27 percentage points since 2012, and each group has narrowed the gap with the university\u2019s overall graduation rate.\u00a0\nOverall, the university\u2019s number and percentage of historically underrepresented students \u2014 who identify as Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander \u2014 rose to their highest levels ever, now representing 33.6% of the undergraduate population and 30.3% of the university as a whole. At the undergraduate level alone, UT Austin will educate 13,872 historically underrepresented students in 2022, one of the largest totals of any state flagship university or member of the prestigious Association of American Universities.\u00a0\u00a0\nHispanic enrollment again reached all-time highs, further cementing the university\u2019s trajectory as one of the country\u2019s largest and most academically prestigious Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). The percentage of Hispanic undergraduates rose to 27.9% from 27.1% last year, and Hispanic students made up a plurality of 29.5% of first-year undergraduates this fall.\u00a0\nThe number of Black undergraduate students also increased, to 2,269 this fall from 2,219 last fall, with the number of Black students overall (graduate and undergraduate) increasing to 2,759 from 2,728.\u00a0\u00a0\nEnrollment of first-generation undergraduate students rose to 9,636 from 9,387 last year, representing 23.3% of all current undergraduates.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are committed to recruiting talented students with diverse backgrounds and experiences,\u201d said Hartzell. \u201cThe gains we have made are a testament to this effort, as well as our campaign pledge to raise $1 billion for scholarships and student support programs that will continue to expand opportunities for Longhorns from traditionally underserved communities.\u201d\u00a0\nNumbers for international students also rose, to 5,117 (9.8% of all students) this year from 4,725 (9.1% of all students) in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Preliminary as of 12th class day\u202f|\u202f** Black includes both \u201cBlack or African American alone\u201d and \u201cBlack or African American Multiracial (excluding Hispanic) | ***Reflects earliest verifiable data from 2014\u00a0\nNotable fall enrollment figures year over year, fall 2021 to fall 2022:\u00a0\nAll 2022 figures in this release are as of the 12th class day and therefore preliminary.

Four-year graduation rates for Black, Hispanic, first-generation, and Pell-eligible students have increased, on average, by 27 percentage points since 2012, narrowing the gap with the university\u2019s overall graduation rate.\n\nThe number and percentage of historically underrepresented students rose to their highest levels ever, now representing 33.6% of the undergraduate population and 30.3% of the university as a whole. UT Austin will educate 13,872 historically underrepresented students in 2022, one of the largest totals of any state flagship university or member of the Association of American Universities.\n\nHispanic enrollment reached all-time highs, with the percentage of Hispanic undergraduates rising to 27.9% from 27.1% last year. Hispanic students made up 29.5% of first-year undergraduates this fall.\n\nThe number of Black undergraduate students increased to 2,269 this fall from 2,219 last fall, with the total number of Black students (graduate and undergraduate) increasing to 2,759 from 2,728.\n\nEnrollment of first-generation undergraduate students rose to 9,636 from 9,387 last year, representing 23.3% of all current undergraduates.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to recruiting talented students with diverse backgrounds and experiences,\u201d said Hartzell. \u201cThe gains we have made are a testament to this effort, as well as our campaign pledge to raise $1 billion for scholarships and student support programs.\u201d\n\nNumbers for international students also rose, to 5,117 (9.8% of all students) this year from 4,725 (9.1% of all students) in 2021.\n\n* Preliminary as of 12th class day | ** Black includes both \u201cBlack or African American alone\u201d and \u201cBlack or African American Multiracial (excluding Hispanic) | ***Reflects earliest verifiable data from 2014\n\nNotable fall enrollment figures year over year, fall 2021 to fall 2022:\n\nAll 2022 figures in this release are as of the 12th class day and therefore preliminary. Some figures, such as graduation rates, may change slightly as further information on student status is finalized for federal and state reporting; final figures will be released in the statistical handbook, the definitive source of annual data on the university.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nUniversity Communications\nEmail: UTMedia@utexas.edu\nPhone: (512) 471-3151\n\nExplore Latest Articles\nSep 19, 2024\nUT Continues To Achieve All-Time Highs in Applications, Enrollment and Graduation Rates\nSep 18, 2024\nPresident Hartzell Emphasizes Talent and Broadens Definition of Student Success in State of the University Address\nSep 18, 2024\nNew AI Institute Led by UT Researchers Will Accelerate Cosmic Discovery\n\u00a9 The University of Texas at Austin 2024",

This website provides an impartial, fact-based overview of K-12 education in the Buckeye State. We hope these data will help to inform conversations about improving education throughout the state. If you have ideas on how this could be improved and made more useful to you, write to us at ohiogadfly@fordhaminstitute.org. For more information about the Institute and its work, please visit www.fordhaminstitute.org/ohio\nView the Report\nStudentEnrollment\n\nOhio Public School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 1.6 million public school students of varying backgrounds and characteristics.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23). Note: Public school enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students, but do not include students attending joint-vocational districts and educational service centers, pupils attending non-public schools, or home schooled students. More information about those enrollments are found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchool Options\u00e2\u0080\u009d section.\nPublic School Enrollment by Grade\u00a0Level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23).\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest race/ethnic student groups, white and African American students, has also declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent change from 2006 to 2023. The chart displays the spring part of the school year, a convention often used in this guide.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, public school enrollment has increased significantly among Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander students.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends by Selected Characteristics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, English learner enrollment has more than doubled, while the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The number of students identified as gifted has declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nLow Income Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe percentage of students identified as economically disadvantaged has increased since 2005-06. However, the percentage of Ohio children living in poverty has remained mostly static.\nSource: Economically disadvantaged data are from Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23); childhood poverty data are from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Kids Count Data Center and based on U.S. Census poverty estimates (data were not reported for 2020 and are not yet available for 2023). Notes: Ohio identifies students as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomically disadvantaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d via federal meal programs, open to pupils from households with incomes at or below 185% of federal poverty. However, in 2010, Congress passed the Community Eligibility Provision which allows certain schools to deem all students as disadvantaged (even higher-income children) for the purposes of meals eligibility. In contrast, children in poverty are from households at or below 100% federal poverty.\nOhio School Districts and Typologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor analytic purposes, the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce categorizes districts into eight typologies based on their geographic and socio-economic characteristics. This publication displays various statistics by typology to illustrate patterns of enrollment and achievement across the state.\nSource: Ohio DEW, School District Typology. Note: This map displays the border of each district and its corresponding typology.\nPublic School Students by Typology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas and 35 percent are from suburban communities; 21 percent live in small towns while 15 percent are from rural areas.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: Public charter and STEM schools are assigned to the typology of the district in which the school is located, as reported in DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community school directory. Online charters\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as e-schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094are not included in a typology, since they can enroll students statewide.\nPublic School Students in Urban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents living in urban areas come from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, and almost nine in ten are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the urban typologies (i.e., urban: very high poverty and urban: high poverty).\nPublic School Students in Suburban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from suburban areas are majority white, with modest racial and ethnic diversity. About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the suburban typologies (i.e., suburban: very low poverty and suburban: low poverty).\nPublic School Students in Small Town Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe large majority of students from small towns are white and more than two in five are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the small town typologies (i.e., small town: high poverty and small town: low poverty).\nPublic School Students in Rural Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from rural areas are overwhelmingly white and just under half are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the rural typologies (i.e., rural: average poverty and rural: high poverty).\nOhio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twenty-Five Largest Districts by Enrollment (2022-23)\nNote: Ohio Virtual Academy, a statewide e-school, is considered equivalent to a school district. This table does not include charter or STEM students as part of the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student population. Enrollment changes of less than +/- 1 percent are considered to have had no substantive change (marked as \u00e2\u0080\u009c--\u00e2\u0080\u009c).\nSchoolOptions\n\nEnrollment by Educational Model\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, while more than 110,000 students attend charter schools and more than 200,000 students attend non-public schools or homeschool.\nSources: All data are for 2022-23 and drawn from various sources from Ohio DEW.\nPublic Charter Schools\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 334 charter schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as community schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094serving more than 110,000 students.\nSources: Ohio DEW downloadable file titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d was used to calculate enrollments for 2022-23 and the community school directory was used to identify the type of charter school. Historical enrollment data were drawn from DEW, Community School Annual Report: 2021-2022.\nCharacteristics of Charter School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of charter school students are economically disadvantaged, and a majority are Black or Hispanic. Nearly 70 percent of charter school students attend brick-and-mortar charters located in urban communities.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23). Note: All statistics in this table include online charter schools; they are not assigned to district typologies, however, because they can draw students from all areas of the state.\nInterdistrict Open Enrollment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFour in five Ohio districts participate in interdistrict open enrollment. Approximately 80,000 students open enroll, with participation generally, until recently, increasing over time.\nSources: Two sources were used for this chart, based on the availability of data. For 2002-03 to 2011-12, data from the Ohio Auditor of State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 report, Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Open Enrollment were used. For 2012-13 to 2022-23, enrollments are calculated based on school districts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 funding reports; see Ohio DEW, Traditional Public Schools Funding.\nPrivate School Scholarships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore than 80,000 students used state-funded scholarships (often referred to as vouchers) to attend private schools in 2022-23.\nSource: Historical Historical data through 2020-21 are from American Federation for Children, School Choice Yearbook (2021). Ohio DEW began recently reporting more detailed voucher data and beginning with 2021-22, numbers are from Advanced Reports. Note: The chart displays the total number of students in the various scholarship programs. For more information on each program, see Ohio DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s webpage, Scholarships.\nHomeschooling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNearly 50,000 students participate in homeschooling; the number of homeschoolers significantly increased in 2020-21 and has decreased slightly since then.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Homeschool Student Data. Note: Students attending online charter schools are not considered homeschool students.\nStudent Achievement:National Exams\n\nNational Exams: NAEP 2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApproximately 30 to 40 percent of Ohio students reach the national standard for proficiency, just above the national average.\nSource: National Assessment of Educational Progress, Data Explorer (2022).

Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

To learn more, check out our full rankings methodology or read the summary below.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRanking Methodology Summary\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo qualify for our rankings lists, each school must be an accredited public or private, nonprofit institution.

Undergraduates attending public four-year colleges in Florida in 2022-2023 paid $4,540 for tuition and fees, about $5,000 less than the national average.\nPrivate college students in Florida also pay less, spending an average of $30,928 in tuition and fees, while the national average for private college tuition was $35,248 in 2022-2023.\nFlorida online colleges may offer a more affordable education since you don't need to pay for transportation and on-campus housing fees, though online learners sometimes need to pay technology fees not charged to on-campus students.\nIn addition, online tuition often costs less than studying on campus. For instance, in-state undergrads at the University of Florida pay $6,380 per year, while in-state undergrads at UF Online pay $3,876 per year.

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "ARTICLE Online vs in-person learning in higher education: effects on student achievement and recommendations for leadership Bandar N. Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Summarized_Document2": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",

This guide will teach you all you need to know about ACT scores!\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIf you want to evaluate how you compare to other test-takers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach you everything you need to know about your scores, including average ACT scores, percentiles, highest ACT scores possible, and much more.\nAverage ACT Scores (2024)\nACT scores range from 1 to 36 in each category (except for writing, out of 12). The average of your four scores determines your ACT composite score. According to ACT Score National Ranks, the average score in each category is:\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to know how the ACT is scored. \u00c2\u00a0First, the number of questions you got correct in each section is counted and converted to scale scores.\nThe average ACT score is 19.9. These rankings are based on almost 4.5 million \u00e2\u0080\u009cACT-tested high school graduates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe ACT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website also released score information for students who decided to take the optional writing test, which contributes to an English Language Arts score (ELA). The average writing and ELA scores are 6.2 and 18.3, respectively. Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test.\nAverage ACT Scores by State\nBelow is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAverage ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US\nLet's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States.\nHighest Possible ACT Score\u00c2\u00a0\nThe highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test.\nACT Scores By Percentile\u00c2\u00a0\nACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nSource: ACT.org\nBased on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive).\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile.\u00c2\u00a0\nOverall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nAre you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies.\nFAQs\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs!\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good?\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application.\u00c2\u00a0\n4. What Is a Low ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nLike what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to?\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce your ACT score is released, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant!\u00c2\u00a0\n6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT?\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant.\n7. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lowest Possible ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe lowest ACT score possible is 1.\n8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section?\nThe average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc.\n9. What is The Average Science ACT Score?\nThe average science ACT score is 20.\nFinal Thoughts\nNow that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.\u00c2\u00a0 A good way to go about it is to test your skills with our Free ACT Practice Questions Pop Quiz.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Reviewed by: Mary Banks Former Admissions Committee Member, Columbia University Reviewed: 4/1/24 If you choose to take the ACT over the SAT, you\u2019ll want to achieve the highest ACT score possible to show your college readiness. This guide will teach you all you need to know about ACT scores! If you want to evaluate how you compare to other test-takers, we\u2019ll teach you everything you need to know about your scores, including average ACT scores, percentiles, highest ACT scores possible, and much more. Average ACT Scores (2024) ACT scores range from 1 to 36 in each category (except for writing, out of 12). The average of your four scores determines your ACT composite score. According to ACT Score National Ranks, the average score in each category is: The average ACT score is 19.9. These rankings are based on almost 4.5 million \u201cACT-tested high school graduates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\u201d The ACT\u2019s website also released score information for students who decided to take the optional writing test, which contributes to an English Language Arts score (ELA). The average writing and ELA scores are 6.2 and 18.3, respectively. Remember, you\u2019ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test. Average ACT Scores by State Below is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing. Average ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US Let's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States. Highest Possible ACT Score The highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score. However, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test. ACT Scores By Percentile ACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category. For example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you. Based on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u2019ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive). However, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile. Overall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time. Are you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies. FAQs If you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs! 1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good? Although a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score. 2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College? While even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness. 3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score? While it\u2019s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application. 4. What Is a Low ACT Score? Like what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low. 5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to? Once your ACT score is released, you\u2019ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant! 6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT? If your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant. 7. What\u2019s the Lowest Possible ACT Score? The lowest ACT score possible is 1. 8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section? The average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc. 9. What is The Average Science ACT Score? The average science ACT score is 20. Final Thoughts Now that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher. If you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive.

This guide will teach you all you need to know about ACT scores!\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIf you want to evaluate how you compare to other test-takers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach you everything you need to know about your scores, including average ACT scores, percentiles, highest ACT scores possible, and much more.\nAverage ACT Scores (2024)\nACT scores range from 1 to 36 in each category (except for writing, out of 12). The average of your four scores determines your ACT composite score. According to ACT Score National Ranks, the average score in each category is:\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to know how the ACT is scored. \u00c2\u00a0First, the number of questions you got correct in each section is counted and converted to scale scores.\nThe average ACT score is 19.9. These rankings are based on almost 4.5 million \u00e2\u0080\u009cACT-tested high school graduates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe ACT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website also released score information for students who decided to take the optional writing test, which contributes to an English Language Arts score (ELA). The average writing and ELA scores are 6.2 and 18.3, respectively. Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test.\nAverage ACT Scores by State\nBelow is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAverage ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US\nLet's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States.\nHighest Possible ACT Score\u00c2\u00a0\nThe highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test.\nACT Scores By Percentile\u00c2\u00a0\nACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nSource: ACT.org\nBased on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive).\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile.\u00c2\u00a0\nOverall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nAre you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies.\nFAQs\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs!\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good?\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application.\u00c2\u00a0\n4. What Is a Low ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nLike what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to?\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce your ACT score is released, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant!\u00c2\u00a0\n6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT?\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant.\n7. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lowest Possible ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe lowest ACT score possible is 1.\n8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section?\nThe average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc.\n9. What is The Average Science ACT Score?\nThe average science ACT score is 20.\nFinal Thoughts\nNow that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.\u00c2\u00a0 A good way to go about it is to test your skills with our Free ACT Practice Questions Pop Quiz.

    "Summarized_Document1": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",
