      " News\n Life\n Entertainment\n  Finance\n Sports\nNew on Yahoo\nYahoo Finance\nNvidia to report Q3 earnings Wednesday as AI fever continues to power Wall Street\nIn This Article: \nNvidia (NVDA) will report its Q3 earnings after the bell next Wednesday, giving Wall Street its best and latest look into the strength of the AI trade.\nThe world\u2019s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia\u2019s stock price has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company\u2019s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia\u2019s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%.\nNvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion.\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That\u2019s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year.\nGaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion.\nAnalysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%.\nInvestors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter.\nEven if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results.\nThat could have been a sign that some investors weren\u2019t impressed with Nvidia\u2019s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time.\nInvestors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company\u2019s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips.\n (NVDA)\nAt the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What\u2019s more, he said the company\u2019s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter.\nNvidia, however, is also facing an uncertain future, with president-elect Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. He\u2019s also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.\nThe vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock\u2019s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I\u2019ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm\u2019s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla\u2019s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla\u2019s \u201cdifficult environment,\u201d the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it\u2019s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla\u2019s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla\u2019s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA\u2019s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla\u2019s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla\u2019s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company\u2019s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%.\nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla\u2019s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles.\nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that\u2019s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

      "Knowledge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Top 5 Trends for Defence in 2024\r\n\t\t\t\nGreat challenges will bring huge opportunities in 2024, as the defence and aerospace industry seeks to rise to a diverse range of hurdles. Amid these headwinds, Defence Engage looks at the trends which could come to characterise 2024, from battling skills shortages to pivotal digitalisation efforts.\nMarked by ongoing conflicts in Israel-Palestine and Ukraine, 2024 will see ongoing tensions with China and Iran which pose significant threats to the international order. Geopolitical concerns aside, the industry grapples with supply chain issues, talent shortages, operational risks, and rising costs amid inflation. In the biggest global election year in history we could see significant strategic changes from key players such as the USA, UK, India, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. Here are the five key trends likely to dominate 2024\u2026\n\u00a0\n#1 AI and digitalisation efforts to bring security and efficiencies\nThe defence industry faces challenges in rapidly adopting new defensive systems and procedures to keep up with adversaries' technological innovations. From upgrading aging software to mitigate cyber threats, to expanding access to, and the adoption of, key cyber credentials, keeping up with digital trends remains pivotal. Meanwhile, governments are prioritising bringing AI to maturity while ensuring its development is safe and responsible. The rapid adoption of AI, spurred by recent advancements like Chat-GPT, is underway in industry, and indeed OpenAI has already started the year by easing its stance on the use of ChatGPT for military purposes.\nThe impact of AI for defence is forecast to be significant, from helping front-line users detect threats to activating cyber defences faster and with greater agility. Additionally, the integration of AI into defence supply chains could improve platform and parts delivery efficiency, reducing delays and costs, whilst improving security. Meanwhile, digital twins, coupled with machine learning, can enhance visibility of supply chain problems or complexities. According to a BAE report, 86% of defence and aerospace decision makers say their nation has adopted AI for defence applications, so the technology is set to become increasingly mature in 2024.\n\u00a0\n#2 Decarbonisation initiatives continue\nFollowing recent data which indicates that 2023 was the hottest year ever, the impetus behind decarbonisation efforts sees renewed urgency. The contribution of the global defence industry to carbon emissions has come under a microscope, with some having suggested that the sector had been overlooked, but there have been some major decarbonisation initiatives, including the establishment of NATO\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and the UK\u2019s Sustainable Support Strategy.\nThe impact of climate change upon defence goes beyond the weight of its own contributions, with both the UN and NATO describing climate change as a \u2018threat multiplier\u2019, alluding to the destabilising impact climate can have on societies and economies. Industry is rising to meet the challenge, with innovations such as new power solutions or increased circularity in manufacturing. \u00a0Last year the EU signalled its intention for defence supply chains to become more sustainable, alongside developing more localised energy in a drive for logistical resilience. Individual initiatives such as the Royal Air Force\u2019s first use of sustainable aviation fuel in a fighter aircraft are lighting the way towards a greener, more sustainable, military.\n\u00a0\n#3 Recruitment challenges to persist\nDefence is facing significant challenges when it comes to acquiring talent, skills and retention, from front-line military roles to cyber, quantum and manufacturing. In recent weeks the UK\u2019s Royal Navy has seen significant problems with hiring, at a critical time for the force, with ships being deployed to the Red Sea to counter Houthi Rebels. Last month, the Times reported that Armed forces and defence companies are locked in \u2018a war for talent\u2019.\nDwindling forces are due to the lack of recruits for basic training, a lack of digital skills, and the pull of incentives given by neighbouring sectors. The EU and US have recently signalled their plans to try and combat personnel shortages in key areas. The US\u2019 new Defence Industrial Strategy, cites \u2018workforce readiness\u2019 as a key strategic focus, with a desire to develop a \u2018sufficiently skilled and staffed workforce\u2019. Meanwhile, the European Commission expects skills shortages to increase into the future, with defence urgently requiring skills and talent acquisition, as procurement organisations seek to develop and manage emerging disruptive technologies.\n\u00a0\n#4 Agile supply chains to be prioritised\nThe scramble to arm Ukraine and Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China have highlighted US and allied supply chain vulnerabilities. The last couple of years have seen efforts to build a more resilient supply chain. The US CHIPS act and the EU CHIPS Act designed to securitise semiconductor supply, the European Defence Agency has set out to ensure \u2018security of supply\u2019 across the EU, and at the start of 2024, the US\u2019 Defence Industrial Strategy took aim at supply chain fragility, seeking to make it more sustainable alongside more flexible acquisition processes.\n2024 will see more emphasis on agile supply chains: increasing pressure to move away from lengthy procurement processes that cannot react quickly enough or where the end product could be outdated by the time it comes into service. There will be a race to secure and effect easy access to increasingly scarce resources such as minerals driven by the appetite for batteries and the move away from fossil fuels. The surge of additive manufacturing creates a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply option, while new military tactics such as the use of drones and increasing need for cyber security will continue to push military to commercial and more readily available solutions.\n\u00a0\n#5 Alliances and collaboration lead development and procurement\nCollaborative development programmes such as the sixth-generation fighter efforts: Tempest (by Italy, Japan and the UK) and FCAS (by France, Germany and Spain), are key initiatives designed to combine the best of each nation\u2019s domestic capabilities and combat declining resources. Meanwhile, the AUKUS programme demonstrates how two established nuclear navies (UK and US) are aiding Australia in bolstering Indo-Pacific security. Furthermore, NATO\u2019s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which opened its doors with three innovation challenges in 2023, has established test centres and accelerator units across Europe and North America. The collaboration of NATO members is nothing new, but this more centralised effort to progress on emerging disruptive technologies is hoped to go from strength to strength in 2024.\nGroup-purchases have become increasingly common amongst NATO allies in recent years, with a marked increase since the war in Ukraine began. Just two weeks ago, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain agreed to jointly purchase $5.5 billion worth of Patriot missiles following their effective use observed in Ukraine. Additionally, the research opportunities posed by the war in Ukraine have seen allies and industry testing experimental tech in partnership with Ukrainian soldiers, helping speed up development initiatives, particularly for drones. Following on from the big trend of multi-domain integration, Defence Engage expects multi-national development, purchases and bids to strengthen regional military power and aid embattled allies such as Israel and Ukraine, to continue in 2024 amid ongoing geopolitical upheaval.\n\u00a0\nKeep ahead of the trends\nDefence Engage connects suppliers and buyers to help make defence accessible, follow us on LinkedIn or register for our weekly Defence Contracts Digest to stay apprised of new solutions and collaboration opportunities this year.\nWant to discover more about how Defence Engage can enhance your lead-gen efforts and boost your discoverability in Defence?

      "The essential resource for\u00a0\nthe global Bio/Pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing value chain\nMaking the Innovation Cut: New Drug Approvals Thus Far in 2024\nMaking the Innovation Cut: New Drug Approvals Thus Far in 2024\nHow is product innovation faring in the bio/pharma industry thus far in 2024? Through the end of October, FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has approved 38 new drugs. Which companies \u00a0and products have made the cut, and which may be best poised for market success?\nBy Patricia Van Arnum, Editorial Director, DCAT, pvanarnum@dcat.org\nNew drug approvals thus far in 2024Although not following a strictly chronological path, examining the pace of new drug approvals is an important measure of product innovation in the bio/pharma industry. Through the end of October (as of October 31, 2024), the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) had approved 38 new molecular entities (NMEs) and biological therapeutics, compared to 46 new drugs approved through October 2023.\nLast year (2023) saw an uptick in new drug approvals compared to 2022, which was a recent dip in new drug approvals. In 2023, FDA\u2019s CDER approved 55 NMEs and new biological therapeutics, a 49% increase in the number of new drug approvals compared to 2022, when 37 new drugs were approved. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 by FDA\u2019s CDER was in line with recent years. In 2021, 50 NMEs and new biological therapeutics were approved and 53 in 2020. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 represented the second highest level of approvals in the past decade, except for 2018 when 59 new drugs were approved (see Figure 1).\nSmall molecules versus biologicsAnother important trend to look at is the product mix of new drug approvals. Of the 38 new drug approvals thus far in 2024 (as of October 31, 2024), 26, or 68%, were small molecules (24 drugs and two diagnostic/imaging agents), and 12, or 32%, were biologics. That is on par with the mix in 2023, when FDA\u2019s CDER approved 17 new biological therapeutics, which represented 31% of new drug approvals, and 38 small-molecule products or 69% of new drug approvals (see Figure 2).\nThe percentage of small-molecule approvals in 2023 was in line with recent years, except in 2022, which represented a recent low. In 2022, 59% of the new drug approvals by FDA\u2019s CDER were small molecules or 22 of the 37 new drug approved. Between 2018 and 2021, small molecules averaged 74% of new drug approvals. In 2021, small molecules represented 72% of new drug approvals, 75% in 2020,\u00a0 79% in 2019, and 71% in 2018.\nThe decrease in small molecules\u2019 share of new drug approvals in 2022 was largely due to the overall decline in new drug approvals in 2022 and a corresponding decline in small-molecule drug approvals and a rise in new biologic drug approvals. In 2022, FDA\u2019s CDER approved 22 new small-molecule drugs and 15 new biologics. The 17 new biologics approved in 2023 surpassed 2022 levels and matched a recent high in 2018, when 17 new biologics were approved by FDA\u2019s CDER, far exceeding biologic approvals of 14 in 2021, 13 in 2020, and 10 in 2019.\nLarge bio/pharma companies versus mid-tier/small companiesThe quantity of new drug approvals, alone, is not a singular measure of product innovation, but tracking it show some interesting trends, notably the increasing contribution of small bio/pharma companies, particularly in the small-molecule drug space. \u00a0\nOf the 38 new drugs approved thus far in 2024, 13, or 34%, were from large companies (defined as the top 25 bio/pharma companies based on 2023 revenues and one large medical technology company with approval of a diagnostic agent), and 25, or 66%, were from mid-sized or small companies. In looking at product mix, biologics accounted for more than half (54%) of new drug approvals by the large companies, but only 20% from mid-sized-to-small companies.\nThe large bio/pharma companies have had seven new biological therapeutics approved thus far in 2024 and five small-molecule drugs. For purposes of this analysis, new biological therapeutics only include those approved by FDA\u2019s CDER, which reviews and approves new molecular entities and new biological therapeutics. Other biologic-based products, including blood products, vaccines, allergenics, tissues, and cellular and gene therapies, are reviewed and approved by a separate center within FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\nSo which companies made the cut in biologics? The seven biologics approved from the large bio/pharma companies were: Amgen\u2019s Imdelltra (tarlatamab-dlle) for treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer; Astellas\u2019 Vyloy (zolbetuximab-clzb) for treating gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, a rare type of cancer of the esophagus; Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz) for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema); Lilly\u2019s Kisunla (donanemab-azbt) for treating early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease;\u00a0 Merck & Co.\u2019s Winrevair (sotatercept-csrk) for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare disease in which blood vessels in the lungs thicken and narrow, causing strain on the heart; \u00a0Pfizer\u2019s Hympavzi (marstacimab-hncq) for preventing or reducing bleeding episodes related to hemophilia A or B; and Roche\u2019s Piasky (crovalimab-akkz) for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare blood disorder.\nThe five small-molecule drug approvals from the large bio/pharmaceutical companies were: AstraZeneca\u2019s Voydeya (danicopan) for treating extravascular hemolysis with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disease; Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy (xanomeline and trospium chloride) for treating schizophrenia; Gilead Sciences\u2019 Livdelzi (seladelpar) for treating primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the liver\u2019s bile ducts, causing a buildup of bile and toxins;\u00a0 Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Lazcluze (lazertinib) for treating non-small cell lung cancer; Roche\u2019s Itovebi (inavolisib) for treating locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In addition, GE Healthcare gained FDA approval for Flyrcado (flurpiridaz F 18), a radioactive diagnostic drug to evaluate for myocardial ischemia and infarction.\nMid-tier & small bio/pharma companies: new drug approvalsSmall-molecules by far dominated new approvals from mid-sized to small companies, with many of the drugs indicated for rare diseases. Below is a roundup of small-molecule drug approvals from mid-sized and small companies thus far this year (as of October 31, 2024):\nOn the biologics side, small-to-mid-sized bio/pharma companies have had five biologics approved thus far in 2024.

Why has the society not made faster progress on cancer front? Why do discoveries in biotechnology sector occur in fits and spurts? We claim that this slow and sporadic progress has a lot to do with the vagaries of capital markets. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begin with a success story. There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cleverage Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.\u00c2\u00a0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\n"

This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\n",

Results from Phase I, II and III clinical studies, and FDA or European approvals (and rejections), can send stocks soaring.\nEveryone is familiar with these monster moves. Recent examples include Amarin Corp's (AMRN) 3X move in one day, or Zosano Pharma Corporations' (ZSAN) 100% rip on recent study results. Now, a new entrant in the large neurological market, NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC), could be on the eve of their first FDA approval, and few investors are paying attention to this small company because it's so new and quiet about what they're doing.\nNevertheless, NMTC is 10% owned by the Mayo Clinic and has a stable of veteran physicians and researchers on their board and advisory board. With the possibility of two FDA clearances in 2019 for their first planned medical devices, the company could have a breakout year if they execute and move from unknown to mainstream.\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2019 / Small healthcare stocks are known for making heroic moves, often when their development-phase drugs or devices move closer to going commercial. Completion of Phase I, II, and III trials can all send stocks rallying, as can approvals from European and U.S. regulators.\nCase in point, Zosano Pharma's (ZSAN) recent monster 100% move recently when they announced success in a Trial of their drug for migraines. Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren't paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne's technologies - sometimes known as ''neurostimulation'' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company's public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt's an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson's using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson's, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson's, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient's skull!\nHere's where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company's initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne's technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they've already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they're working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC's public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic's Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company's scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company's new \"artificial intelligence\" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne's electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa's successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

Agencies and organizations are working to prepare people as their world changes around them, and NASA information is helping these efforts.\nThe agency\u2019s global data is now available in the sea level section of the Earth Information Center. NASA developed the global sea level change website in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, the World Bank, the U.S. Department of State, and the United Nations Development Programme. \u00a0\nThe site includes information on projected sea level rise through the year 2150 for coastlines around the world, as well as estimates of how much flooding a coastal community or region can expect to see in the next 30 years. The projections come from data collected by NASA and its partners and from computer models of ice sheets and the ocean, as well as the latest sea level assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other sources.\n\u201cNASA innovates for the benefit of humanity.

Similarly, the State Department uses the information for activities ranging from disaster preparedness to long-term adaptation planning to supporting partners around the world in related efforts.\n\u201cWe are at a moment of truth in our fight against the climate crisis. The science is unequivocal and must serve as the bedrock upon which decision-making is built. With many communities around the world already facing severe impacts from sea-level rise, this new resource provides a vital tool to help them protect lives and livelihoods. It also illustrates what is at stake between a 1.5-degree-Celsius world and a current-policies trajectory for all coastal communities worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Secretary-General Selwin Hart, special adviser to the United Nations secretary-general on climate action and just transition.\nRising Faster\nNASA-led data analyses have revealed that between 1970 and 2023, 96% of countries with coastlines have experienced sea level rise. The rate of that global rise has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) per year in 1993 to about 0.18 inches (0.45 centimeters) per year in 2023.\nAs the rate of sea level rise increases, millions of people could face the related effects sooner than previously projected, including larger storm surges, more saltwater intrusion into groundwater, and additional high-tide flood days \u2014 also known as nuisance floods or sunny day floods.\n\u201cThis new platform shows the timing of future floods and the magnitude of rising waters in all coastal countries worldwide, connecting science and physics to impacts on people\u2019s livelihoods and safety,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director of the ocean physics program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nData released earlier this year found that Pacific Island nations will experience at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) of sea level rise in the next 30 years. The number of high-tide flood days will increase by an order of magnitude for nearly all Pacific Island nations by the 2050s.\n\u201cThe data is clear: Sea levels are rising around the world, and they\u2019re rising faster and faster,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and head of the agency\u2019s sea level change science team. \u201cHaving the best information to make decisions about how to plan for rising seas is more crucial than ever.\u201d\nTo explore the global sea level change site:\nhttps://earth.gov/sealevel\nNews Media Contacts\nKaren Fox / Elizabeth VlockNASA Headquarters, Washington202-358-1600karen.c.fox@nasa.gov / elizabeth.a.vlock@nasa.gov\nJane J.

      "\nMain Menu\nBreadcrumb\nU.S. climate outlook for September 2024\nAfter a very hot early and middle part of summer, August provided a welcome relief across much of the nation, with much-above-normal temperatures largely confined to the Deep South. The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer.\nSummer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August.\nAs we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here\u2019s the outlook from NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September.\nThe U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September.\u00a0Much warmer\u00a0or\u00a0much cooler than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nOn August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above average temperatures across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above average precipitation along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest.\nThe precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September.\u00a0Much higher\u00a0or\u00a0much lower than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nIn addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I\u2019ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here\u2019s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the most likely outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found here.\nThe updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC\u2019s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With the expected arrival of La Ni\u00f1a somewhat delayed, it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry) can influence temperatures and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks.\nTemperature outlook favors more heat in the West, uncertainty in much of the East\nThe September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. (Well above average means \u201cin the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.\u201d) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with equal chance odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions.\nThe best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is \u201cequal chances\u201d along the coast.\nIt\u2019s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so \u201cequal chances\u201d is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month.\nPrecipitation outlook tilts wet in across the South, mainly dry across the North\nThe precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-\u201cequal chances\u201d forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough.\nBelow-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods.\nU. S. Drought area increases further during August\nThe amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing extreme and exceptional drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards.\nThe summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our\u00a0Data Snapshots Collection,\u00a0based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project.\u00a0\nRegionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north.\nDrought outlook mainly predicts persistence and development, but improvement across parts of the South\nU.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See\u00a0CPC version\u00a0for Alaska and Hawaii.\nWith above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.\nTo read the entire discussion of the monthly climate outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center, check out their\u00a0website.\nWe value your feedback\nHelp us improve our content\nRelated Content\nNEWS & FEATURES\nMAPS & DATA\nTEACHING CLIMATE\nCLIMATE RESILIENCE TOOLKIT\nStay Connected\n",
      "Secretary Naig: \u201cIowa Remained a Production Powerhouse\u201d\nDES MOINES, Iowa (Jan. 12, 2024) \u2013 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig commented today on the 2023 Iowa Crop Production Annual Summary released by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. The national summary and state summaries are released in January each year. \u00a0\n\u201cEven with all the weather challenges last year, Iowa remained a production powerhouse and that\u2019s a testament to the assistance of timely rains, the resiliency of Iowa farmers, and continuous improvements in genetics, traits, equipment, technology, production methods and many other innovations,\u201d said Secretary Naig.\u00a0\nDespite 2023 ending as the state\u2019s 22nd driest year on record, with 8 of the 12 months registering below normal precipitation and persistent drought continuing for a record 184 consecutive weeks and counting, Iowans once again produced a historically strong corn and soybean crop.2023 Iowa crop production highlights include:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 201 bushels per acre and 2.52 billion bushels of production, this year\u2019s Iowa corn crop ranks as the 4th highest yield and 5th largest production in state history and helped drive the national corn yield and production to all-time record levels.\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 58 bushels per acre and 573 million bushels of production, this year\u2019s soybean crop ranked as the 4th highest yield and 3rd highest production in Iowa history, contributing to the country\u2019s 4th highest yield and 7th largest soybean crop ever.Strong production requires continual efforts to build markets and promote conservation, both of which are top priorities for Secretary Naig and the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\u201cAs Iowa remains a pacesetter in innovation and crop production,\u00a0I'll continue to focus on protecting our essential natural resources like soil and water, and creating new markets and expanding existing markets locally, domestically and internationally,\u201d said Secretary Naig.Iowa Crop ProductionCorn for grain production in Iowa for 2023 was estimated at 2.52 billion bushels, according to the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service \u2013 Crop Production 2023 Summary. Current year production was up 2 percent from the previous year's 2.47 billion bushels. Iowa's corn for grain yield was estimated at 201.0 bushels per acre. Area harvested for grain was estimated at 12.6 million acres, 200,000 acres above 2022. Corn planted for all purposes in 2023 was estimated at 13.1 million acres.Corn for silage production was estimated at 7.60 million tons, down 7 percent from 2022. The silage yield estimate of 20.0 tons per acre was down 1.0 tons per acre from 2022. Producers harvested 380,000 acres of corn for silage, down 3 percent from 2022.Soybean production was estimated at 573 million bushels in 2023. This was down 2 percent from last year's 587 million bushels. The Iowa soybean crop yielded 58.0 bushels per acre in 2023. The harvested acreage of 9.88 million was down 150,000 acres from 2022. Soybean planted acreage, at 9.95 million, was down 150,000 acres from 2022.All hay production for the state was estimated at 2.95 million tons, down 18 percent from the 3.58 million tons produced in 2022. Producers averaged 2.92 tons per acre, down 0.14 tons per acre from 2022. All hay harvested acres were estimated at 1.01 million acres, down 160,000 acres from 2022.Alfalfa and alfalfa mixtures for hay production was estimated at 2.40 million tons, down 11 percent from 2022. Producers averaged 3.20 tons per acre, down 0.50 tons per acre from 2022. Harvested acres were up 20,000 from last year, to 750,000 acres. Iowa producers seeded 70,000 acres of alfalfa and alfalfa mixtures in 2023, down 7 percent from 2022.Other hay production was estimated at 546,000 tons, down 38 percent from 2022. Producers averaged 2.10 tons per acre, up 0.10 tons from the 2022 yield. Harvested acres of other hay, at 260,000, were down 180,000 acres from 2022.United States Crop ProductionCorn for grain production in 2023 was estimated at a record high 15.3 billion bushels, up 12 percent from the 2022 estimate. The average yield in the United States was estimated at a record high 177.3 bushels per acre, 3.9 bushels above the 2022 yield of 173.4 bushels per acre. Area harvested for grain was estimated at 86.5 million acres, up 10 percent from the 2022 estimate.Soybean production in 2023 totaled 4.16 billion bushels, down 2 percent from 2022. The average yield per acre was estimated at 50.6 bushels, up 1.0 bushel from 2022. Harvested area, at 82.4 million acres, was down 4 percent from last year.The complete report can be found on the USDA NASS website at www.nass.usda.gov/Publications.\u00a0\n###\nLed by Secretary Mike Naig, the Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship serves the rural and urban residents that call Iowa home.

      "Heat Stress on the Great Barrier Reef\nMarch 4, 2024JPEG\nAustralia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef has been hit by widespread coral bleaching caused by heat stress, government officials confirmed on March 8, 2024. This is the fifth mass bleaching of the reef since 2016. \nAerial surveys of over 300 reefs conducted by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which monitors the health of the coral, found bleaching in shallow water areas spanning two-thirds of the reef. \n\u201cThe results of the aerial survey and the coral bleaching that we are seeing are consistent with the patterns of heat stress that have been building over the reef over the summer months,\u201d said Roger Beeden, chief scientist at the reef authority. \nThe Great Barrier Reef lies off the northeast coast of Queensland, Australia. It is one of the richest and most biodiverse natural ecosystems on Earth. Spread across 346,000 square kilometers (134,000 square miles) of the Coral Sea, it comprises 2,500 individual reefs and more than 900 islands. \nBleaching events are caused by sustained, warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae known as zooxanthellae, which provide the coral polyps with nutrients as well as their bright colors. Heat stress causes the corals to expel the zooxanthellae, leaving the skeletal structures with a \u201cbleached\u201d appearance. \nA common metric used to assess the risk to coral reefs from high water temperature is the number of weeks that sea surface temperatures have exceeded the mean monthly maximum temperature by 1 degree Celsius. Significant coral bleaching may occur after 4 weeks of elevated temperatures, and severe, widespread coral bleaching is likely after 8 such weeks. As of early March, parts of the reef had been exposed to between 8 and 10 hotter-than-normal weeks, according to the reef authority. \nThe map above shows sea surface temperature anomalies off the coast of eastern Australia on March 4, 2024. It is based on data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project, an effort by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that blends measurements of sea surface temperatures from multiple NASA, NOAA, and international satellites, as well as ship and buoy observations. Rather than showing absolute temperature, the anomaly reflects the difference between the sea surface temperature on March 4, 2024, and the 2003-2014 average for that day. \nPrevious mass bleaching events on the reef occurred in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, \u201cPrior to these years, there is no evidence of such widespread events in the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s 500-year coral record history.\u201d \nDuring the latter half of 2023 and beginning of 2024, trade winds in the Pacific Ocean relaxed, allowing warm water from the western Pacific to push into the eastern Pacific\u2014a phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o. This pattern, on top of human-caused climate change, has driven global average sea surface temperatures to record highs for the past 10 months. However, the relationship between El Ni\u00f1o and sea surface temperatures off the coast of eastern Australia is a bit more complicated. \n\u201cSea surface temperatures during El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events act a bit like a seesaw,\u201d said Josh Willis, a climate scientist at JPL. \u201cWhen ocean temperatures during an El Ni\u00f1o are higher in the eastern Pacific, they\u2019re typically lower in the western Pacific.\u201d \nResearch has found that patterns in large-scale ocean circulation and climate change alone do not fully explain trends in sea surface temperatures and bleaching in the Coral Sea. Rather, weather patterns during El Ni\u00f1o events have historically suppressed the Australian summer monsoon, resulting in reduced cloud cover and higher-than-average air temperatures. These conditions play a big role in determining temperatures in the Coral Sea and the extent and location of coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef. \nNASA Earth Observatory image by Michala Garrison, using data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project and reef information from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA).

Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023\u20132024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short \u2022 This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). \u2022 Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. \u2022 Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. \u2022 Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. \u2022 Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1\u20132.5\u00b0C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. \u2022 The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. \u2022 The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 \u2013 December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 \u2013 January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. \u2022 Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. \u2022 In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. \u2022 Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. \u2022 On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. \u2022 On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% \u2013 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. \u2022 On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. \u2022 The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. \u2022 It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. \u2022 The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer\u2019s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS\u2019 coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 12 reefs had >30% \u2013 50% cover and four reefs had >50% \u2013 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA. Central Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cooktown to Proserpine) Surveyed August 2023 to June 2024 Image 2: Variable reef state on the Central GBR. A. Storm damage from Cyclone Kirrily on Kelso Reef. B. Coral assemblages were patchy at Beaver Reef. C. High coral cover but medium bleaching (10% \u2013 30% of corals) at Slate Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays D. Bleaching at Chicken Reef, on the outer shelf off Townsville. E. Flourishing coral gardens on the back reef of Agincourt Reef No. 1 offshore from Port Douglas. F. Coral cover has increased rapidly at Hyde Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% \u2013 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown\u2010of\u2010 thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% \u2013 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% \u2013 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% \u2013 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% \u2013 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% \u201350% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22\u201311.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% \u2013 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% \u2013 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does \u2018percent hard coral cover\u2019 mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% \u2013 10%, >10% \u2013 30%, >30% \u2013 50%, >50% \u2013 75% and >75% \u2013 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% \u2013 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% \u2013 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% \u2013 10%, b) >10% \u2013 30%, c) >30% \u2013 50% and d) >50% \u2013 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023\u20132024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths \u2013 Shallow (2\u20135m), Mid (7\u20139m) and Deep (9\u201312m) \u2013 and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%\u201350% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024.

Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% \u2013 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% \u2013 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1\u20139.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2\u20139.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8\u2013 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2\u201311.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% \u2013 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% \u2013 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4\u201313.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3\u201315.6 DHWs \u2013 cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9\u201311.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3\u20139.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% \u2013 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% \u2013 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the \u2018shifting baseline\u2019 syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak \u2018wave\u2019 through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS\u2019 research and monitoring.

We also recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land and sea Country on which the Australian Institute of Marine Science works and as Australia\u2019s first scientists. Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023\u20132024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short \u2022 This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). \u2022 Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. \u2022 Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. \u2022 Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. \u2022 Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1\u20132.5\u00b0C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. \u2022 The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. \u2022 The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 \u2013 December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 \u2013 January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. \u2022 Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. \u2022 In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. \u2022 Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. \u2022 On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. \u2022 On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% \u2013 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. \u2022 On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. \u2022 The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. \u2022 It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. \u2022 The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer\u2019s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS\u2019 coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 12 reefs had >30% \u2013 50% cover and four reefs had >50% \u2013 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA.

Storm damage from Cyclone Kirrily on Kelso Reef. B. Coral assemblages were patchy at Beaver Reef. C. High coral cover but medium bleaching (10% \u2013 30% of corals) at Slate Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays D. Bleaching at Chicken Reef, on the outer shelf off Townsville. E. Flourishing coral gardens on the back reef of Agincourt Reef No. 1 offshore from Port Douglas. F. Coral cover has increased rapidly at Hyde Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% \u2013 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown\u2010of\u2010 thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% \u2013 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% \u2013 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% \u2013 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% \u2013 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% \u201350% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22\u201311.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% \u2013 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% \u2013 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does \u2018percent hard coral cover\u2019 mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% \u2013 10%, >10% \u2013 30%, >30% \u2013 50%, >50% \u2013 75% and >75% \u2013 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% \u2013 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% \u2013 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% \u2013 10%, b) >10% \u2013 30%, c) >30% \u2013 50% and d) >50% \u2013 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023\u20132024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths \u2013 Shallow (2\u20135m), Mid (7\u20139m) and Deep (9\u201312m) \u2013 and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%\u201350% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0\u20132 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2\u20134 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4\u20136 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6\u20138 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program. Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% \u2013 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% \u2013 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1\u20139.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2\u20139.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8\u2013 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2\u201311.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% \u2013 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% \u2013 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4\u201313.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3\u201315.6 DHWs \u2013 cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9\u201311.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3\u20139.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% \u2013 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% \u2013 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the \u2018shifting baseline\u2019 syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak \u2018wave\u2019 through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS\u2019 research and monitoring.

      "10 Impactful Ways to Conserve Coral Reefs\n\n\t\t\tBy: \t\t\tAuthor Our Endangered World \nPosted on Last updated: October 13, 2023\nWhat can we do to conserve coral reefs? Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat\u2019s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world\u2019s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don\u2019t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef\u2019s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens\u2019 labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don\u2019t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don\u2019t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water\u2019s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\u00a0\u00a0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n"

      "10 Impactful Ways to Conserve Coral Reefs\n\n\t\t\tBy: \t\t\tAuthor Our Endangered World \nPosted on Last updated: October 13, 2023\nWhat can we do to conserve coral reefs? Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat\u2019s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world\u2019s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don\u2019t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef\u2019s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens\u2019 labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don\u2019t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don\u2019t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water\u2019s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\u00a0\u00a0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8.

Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9.

This is a sharp increase from the previous assessment, published in 2008, which found a third of corals were in danger of being lost.\nClimate change is the leading cause of the declines, with high temperatures causing corals to eject the photosynthetic algae that live in their tissues. These events, known as bleaching, are becoming more extreme and more frequent, and causing mass die-offs in reefs across the world.\nThe IUCN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Director General, Dr Grethel Aguilar, has called for strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions as the best option to protect these vital species.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis global coral assessment vividly illustrates the severe impacts of our rapidly changing climate on life on Earth and drives home the severity of the consequences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealthy ecosystems like coral reefs are essential for human livelihoods \u00e2\u0080\u0093 providing food, stabilising coastlines, and storing carbon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe protection of our biodiversity is not only vital for our wellbeing but crucial for our survival. Climate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nCorals get their colour from the photosynthetic algae that live inside them, as part of a relationship which has lasted for over 380 million years. \u00c2\u00a9 Alexandre.ROSA/ Shutterstock\nHow endangered are corals, and why are they important?\nThe results of the latest Red List are the latest reminder of the dangers that reef-building corals face, with the animals having become more threatened with every reassessment of their health.\nWhile Red List assessments have changed over the past 30 years, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated that just 13 coral species were considered Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered in the 1990s. By the time of the next assessment in 2008, this figure had risen to 231.\nIt has now risen again, by more than 100, meaning almost half of all corals are at significant risk of extinction. This makes corals proportionately more endangered than all the major animal groups on land, including amphibians, mammals and reptiles.\nIf these coral species do become extinct, their loss would cause major changes for life in the oceans. Coral reefs support around a quarter of all marine life, and so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that coral extinctions could cause losses among fish, crustaceans and many other groups.\nThe loss of coral reefs would also remove an important nursery habitat for fish, as the hard skeletons provide a safe area for small fish to grow up in, away from large predators. Fewer nursery habitats would likely mean fewer fish, impacting both predator populations and fisheries.\nThe economic impact of coral extinctions goes much further than fishing, with reefs estimated to prevent billions of pounds worth of damage from flooding and erosion every year by breaking up waves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also likely tourism would suffer, cutting off a vital source of income for many communities.\nThe most at-risk reefs are in the Atlantic, where half of all species are at risk of extinction and a quarter are Critically Endangered. In a separate paper, published in PLOS One, researchers have examined the threats facing these corals in particular.\nThe staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis is found in the Atlantic, and is considered Critically Endangered under the most recent Red List. \u00c2\u00a9\u00c2\u00a0Alberto Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez-Ram\u00c3\u00adrez\nWhy are Atlantic corals so threatened?\nWhile the vast majority of reefs are found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, around 10% are found in the Atlantic. These corals are very distinct from their relatives, having been separated from other corals by the joining of North and South America over three million years ago.\nIn total, 85 shallow-water coral species live in the Atlantic, with the most important hotspots found in the Caribbean and off the coast of Brazil.\u00c2\u00a0As study co-author Dr Nadia Santodomingo explains, the limited ability of these species to respond to the threats facing them means these reefs are more vulnerable to collapse.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAtlantic corals have been hit the hardest by reef decline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Nadia, a Curator of Fossil Cnidaria at the Natural History Museum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing a perfect storm of threats, of which climate change is just one part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese corals are being significantly impacted by overfishing, pollution and coral diseases which are more prevalent in the Atlantic than in other regions. As a result, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprised to see the results of the IUCN assessment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDisease has perhaps had the most dramatic impact on Atlantic corals, devastating not only the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corals but also the animals they depend on. An unknown illness is suspected to have killed as much as 98% of the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-spined sea urchins in the 1980s, meaning these grazers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent algae from dominating many reefs.\nNew diseases are continuing to emerge, with stony coral tissue loss disease first detected in 2014. The illness has spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean, killing as many as 94% of all infected corals.\nRising temperatures are also an increasing threat, with bleaching just the tip of the iceberg. Higher levels of carbon dioxide are making the ocean more acidic, making it harder for corals to grow their calcium carbonate skeletons. Climate change has also been linked with rising numbers of hurricanes in the region, which are washing away centuries-old reefs in a matter of hours.\nWhile the PLOS One study raises plenty of cause for concern, it also notes some reasons to be hopeful. After the devastating declines of the 1970s and 1980s, the researchers found that the fall in Atlantic coral cover appears to be getting smaller.\nTo support these green shoots of recovery, further research needs to be taken to understand how corals can adapt to the challenges that face them. As Dr Beth Polidoro, a co-lead author of the paper, explains, this must go hand in hand with urgent action to combat climate change and the other threats facing coral.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions alongside action to address local threats if we want to give coral reefs a chance to survive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Beth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy acting now, we can slow the pace of ocean warming and broaden the window of opportunity for corals to potentially adapt and survive in the long term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRead more\nDiscover oceans\nFind out more about why we need to protect oceans and read about the pioneering work of our marine scientists.\nRelated posts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoral reefs cover more of Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface than realised, new estimates reveal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSatellite images have revealed a missing 64,000 square kilometres of coral cover, an area similar to the size of Ireland.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver half of coral reef cover across the world has been lost since 1950\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCoral reefs have declined by over half since the 1950s as they suffer from the effects of climate change and overfishing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe resilient coral reefs surviving ocean warming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOcean warming is threatening coral reefs but some reefs are surviving the warming waters and offer hope for these vital ecosystems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighlighting coral reefs at risk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat can antique corals reveal about the impact of climate change on the ocean?\nDon't miss a thing\nReceive email updates about our news, science, exhibitions, events, products, services and fundraising activities.

Each participant\u2019s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u2014including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u2014and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u201cAppropriate monetary policy\u201d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u2019s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u201312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u2019 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u2019 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nTable 2.

For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. Return to table\n2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. Return to table\n3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nForecast Uncertainty\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u201cfan charts\u201d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u2019 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBack to Top\nLast Update: September 18, 2024\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\n\nTools and Information\n\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies | Privacy Program\nAccessibility\n\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page Federal Reserve Instagram Page Federal Reserve YouTube Page Federal Reserve Flickr Page Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page Federal Reserve Threads Page Link to Federal Reserve Twitter Page Subscribe to RSS Subscribe to Email\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551",
      "L.A. County faces $12.5 billion in climate costs through 2040, study says\nA first-of-its-kind report has estimated  that Los Angeles County must invest billions of dollars through 2040 to protect residents from worsening climate hazards, including extreme heat, increasing precipitation, worsening wildfires, rising sea levels and climate-induced public health threats.\nThe report, published this week by the nonprofit Center for Climate Integrity, identified  14 different climate adaptation measures that authors calculated would  cost L.A. taxpayers at least $12.5 billion over the next 15 years, or approximately $780 million per year. The vast majority of those costs \u2014 more than $9 billion \u2014 will be incurred by local municipal governments, including the cities of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Santa Clarita, the report said.\n\u201cThese numbers don\u2019t include the costs of recovering from disasters \u2014 from extreme weather events that knock out power or damage infrastructure or do all the kinds of things they do,\u201d said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity. \u201cSo it\u2019s a very conservative estimate, and yet it\u2019s a really big number.\u201d \nAggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.\nWiles said the costs for L.A. County are nearly as high as for the entire state of Pennsylvania, which faces about $15 billion in climate adaptation costs over roughly the same  period. \n\u201cThis is a big number, but this is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThese costs will be incurred at some point, and it\u2019s just much better to pay now than it is to pay later. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough.\u201d\nThe most expensive adaptation categories are related to precipitation and heat, including an estimated $4.3 billion for improved stormwater management, $2.5 billion for cool pavement investments and $1.4 billion for tree canopies to combat urban heat islands, the report found. Other costs include wildfire mitigation; coastal defense and infrastructure protection; building upgrades for cooling and air conditioning; and responses to vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus.\nCounty officials said the findings weren\u2019t surprising and agreed that they may even be conservative given the scale of the threats. \n\u201cThe impacts of climate have become more and more visible over the past few years in particular,\u201d said Rita Kampalath, L.A. County\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re facing really, really huge needs in terms of how we prepare our communities to face those, and to be resilient in the face of increased climate impacts. It\u2019s only going to increase from here.\u201d\nStormwater capture in particular has been on the minds of many Angelenos this winter as record-breaking rainfall pounded the region. A monster storm in February saw the Los Angeles River roar to life and funnel millions of gallons  into the Pacific Ocean.\nBut the  river \u2014 which was encased in concrete nearly a hundred years ago \u2014 and other local  flood channels will be no match for climate change-enhanced storms of the future. Though the long-term trend in the West is toward hotter and drier conditions, Los Angeles will still see bouts of severe storms and extreme wet years that will increase flood risk significantly, according to the state\u2019s fourth climate change assessment. \nTo mitigate these impacts, the county must expand its stormwater drainage infrastructure by installing bioswales, porous pavement and other opportunities for stormwater to seep into the ground, the report found. It noted that these \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d upgrades are the least expensive option to cope with extreme rainfall events, as opposed to increasing the size and scale of hard infrastructure such as drain pipes. \n Climate & Environment \n The unloved L.A. River just prevented a flood disaster. Can more of its water be saved? \nCapturing rainfall is only one part of the L.A. River\u2019s job. It is also a flood control channel that is critical to protecting lives and properties when stormwaters surge. \nFeb. 8, 2024\nThe county is making progress on this work through its Safe Clean Water Program, passed by voters as Measure W in 2018, Kampalath said. The program allocates about $280 million annually to stormwater capture projects, although recent reports have found that progress to date has been slow. \n\u201cWhile it is a big need, I do actually feel like the county has been investing, and our residents and voters in particular have shown that this is a high priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not as far as we would like to be \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say that about much of anything when it comes to climate \u2014 but I do think that we have resources available to try to address some of these needs.\u201d \nMeanwhile, extreme heat continues to pose a significant threat to L.A. County residents, and it is  predicted to only get worse in the years and decades ahead. The region is expected to experience an average of 48.5 days above 90 degrees per year between 2024 and 2040, the report says. That\u2019s about 12.5 more hot days per year than communities experienced between 1994 and 2013. \nSome of the best methods to combat the dangers of rising heat include installing cool pavements, expanding urban green space, painting railway  tracks with reflective paint to keep them at operable temperatures, and upgrading cooling systems for public buildings such as schools, the report says. Converting public parking lots to cool pavements that reflect instead of absorb sunlight can also help lower ambient temperatures.\nHeat is \u201cthe impact that affects communities of color the most, and people less able to adapt themselves and their personal lives,\u201d Wiles said. He noted that some urban areas can simmer up to 20 degrees hotter than surrounding neighborhoods with heavy tree canopies. \n\u201cFrom a public health perspective, these types of adaptations are increasingly critical just to make neighborhoods livable,\u201d he said.\nThe report comes at a moment when the state is facing a significant $37.9-billion budget deficit, which has prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to slash $2.9 billion from California climate programs, delay an additional $1.9 billion and shift $1.8 billion to other funds. \nKampalath said it\u2019s too soon to say whether those cuts will trickle down to L.A. County\u2019s climate efforts, but that they could potentially affect  funds officials were hoping to take advantage of through grants and other programs.\nHowever, she noted that many of the county\u2019s climate adaptation strategies can have multiple benefits, such as tree canopy programs that help combat heat and improve stormwater management simultaneously.\n\u201cAs we\u2019re looking at how to address these impacts, we do need to think about a multi-benefit approach, and what kind of strategies we can put in place that are really going to address a wide range of things \u2014 not only climate, but biodiversity and health impacts and the well-being of our communities as well,\u201d she said.\n Climate & Environment \n As climate hazards converge, more Californians are living in harm\u2019s way \nWhen wildfire smoke and extreme heat combine, they create a \u201csynergistic effect\u201d or an additional burden on people\u2019s health, researchers say.\nFeb. 3, 2024\nUltimately, funding for the projects outlined in the report will come from taxpayers, whether at the municipal, state or federal level, Wiles said. But he also hopes that oil and gas companies will be held accountable for their role in the worsening climate crisis, as fossil fuel emissions are by far the largest driver of global warming.\nLast year, California filed a bombshell lawsuit against five of the largest oil and gas companies for their alleged \u201cdecades-long campaign of deception\u201d about the risks posed by fossil fuels, which have forced the state to spend billions of dollars to address environmental-related damages. State Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta is seeking to create a nuisance abatement fund to finance climate mitigation and adaptation efforts, among other outcomes. \n\u201cEach and every community in Los Angeles County should consider bringing similar legal actions to hold climate polluters accountable and ensure that taxpayers aren\u2019t left to pay the bill alone,\u201d the report says. \nIndeed, there are other climate hazards that will cost Angelenos billions in adaptation expenses over the next decade and a half, the report found. \nThey include an increase in vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus as more mosquitoes are drawn to the area\u2019s changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. About 500,000 new cases of the virus are expected in the county through 2040, which will cost an estimated $993 million to treat. Climate change will also lead to more pediatric asthma cases due to an increase in pollen, with about 160,000 new cases expected through 2040. \nThe county also needs about $680 million in road improvements as heat and rain contribute to more cracks, erosion and soft surfaces. A foot of sea level rise along the coast of L.A. County  will require at least $576 million for berms, flood walls, bank stabilization and other infrastructure measures to prevent flooding and to avoid infrastructure damage by 2040. \nWildfires, already getting larger, faster and more frequent across California, will necessitate nearly $1 billion  just to clear vegetation and other fuels from land around the county\u2019s infrastructure, the report found. It noted that L.A. County will face an average of 36 more high-fire days through 2040 when compared to the 1994-to-2013 baseline. \nThe estimated $919-million wildfire cost does not account for fighting fires or repairing damage from blazes. The 2018 Woolsey fire racked up an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in insured losses alone. \nWiles said the expenses outlined in the report won\u2019t solve climate change but will help \u201chold things where they are today,\u201d or least prevent the hazards from getting worse. \nHe said he hoped the report would help guide county officials as they face difficult choices about where, how and to what limited funds should be allocated. Investing in climate adaptations now can save money \u2014 and lives \u2014 later, he said. \n\u201cThese costs are still coming,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cThe next disaster will happen. This is just what it\u2019s going to cost to prepare.\u201d\nToward a more sustainable California\nGet Boiling Point, our newsletter exploring climate change, energy and the environment, and become part of the conversation \u2014 and the solution.\n You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. \nMore to Read \n Endorsement: Yes on Proposition 4.

      "Hydrology and Big River Update\nAfter a wet and joyous 2023 water year, water managers and planners are feeling a little less optimistic about 2024. The good times from the previous period of plenty are now replaced with a feeling of foreboding, like the morning after a great party, as we face a below average forecast for 2024.\nLocally, there is good news to lessen the potential whiplash. Water supply conditions remain good with average to above average soil moisture conditions and healthy carryover storage projected for most of the reservoirs in the District. Also potentially hedging against a dry 2024, is the return of a strong El Ni\u00f1o, with near record warming of sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific. This is generally correlated with increased precipitation in the southwestern U.S, especially in the spring. According to NOAA Climate Prediction Center, \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o remains the major climate driver and is expected to be the primary influence on the mid-latitude circulation\u201d for the near term. Figure 1 reflects this with a slightly wetter near-term (Jan-March 2024) outlook.\nUnfortunately, the benefits of El Ni\u00f1o circulation patterns may be adversely influenced by the significant warming that is affecting the region and across the globe. Climate scientists have now confirmed that 2023 was officially the warmest year ever for the planet.\n\nAcross the Upper Basin and for inflows to Lakes Powell and Mead, the early water supply forecasts are not good and represent a significant departure from the heady days of 2023; the days of increasing or even stable reservoir levels may not persist into the near-term picture, without some changes.\nSince the last staff hydrology memo presented in October 2023, the once near-average seasonal inflow forecast volume for April to July of 2024 has decreased precipitously, losing more than 3 million acre-feet (\u201cmaf\u201d), according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center, due to excessively dry conditions. The current unregulated inflow forecast for Lake Powell is 4.80 maf or 75% of average and the unregulated inflow forecast for the entire water year for Lake Powell is 7.62 maf or 79% of average. Combined with a projected 7.48 MAF release from Glen Canyon dam, pursuant to the 2007 Interim guidelines, and consideration evaporation losses, annual inflow could be almost the same as annual outflow putting Lake Powell projected elevations to be unchanged at approximately the same elevation of 3668.5 feet AMSL at this same time next year, under this most probable (50% exceedance) inflow projection.\nFor Lake Mead, the most probable projection indicates that Level 1 shortages will likely persist in the Lower Basin in 2024, with Hoover Dam releases limited to about 8.4 million acre-feet to meet reduced downstream demands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Posts\t\t\t\t\t\nPhone: 970.945.8522 \nFax: 970.945.8799\nEmail: edinfo@crwcd.org\nColorado River Water Conservation District\n201 Centennial St., Suite 200\nGlenwood Springs, CO 81601\nInteractive Map\nFor accessibility inquiries or assistance, please contact:\nEmail: accessibility@crwcd.org\n",
      "Drought in the Colorado River Basin\nInsights using open data\nSince 2000, the Colorado River Basin (Basin) has been experiencing a historic, extended drought that has impacted regional water supply and other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and ecologic services. During this time, the Basin has experienced its lowest 16-year period of inflow in over 100 years of record keeping, and reservoir storage in the Colorado River system has declined from nearly full to about half of capacity. \nThis application was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation in support of the Department of the Interior\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Open Water Data Initiative (OWDI). This visualization is part of a multi-agency effort to showcase the usefulness of open data (i.e., data provided in a discoverable, sharable, and machine-readable format) by exploring the current 16-year drought and its effects on the Colorado River Basin. \nConcern is growing about the impacts of the ongoing drought and declining reservoir levels, such as decreasing water supply and the possibility of a first-ever shortage condition of drinking water for the Lower Basin; decreasing hydropower capacities at Lake Powell and Lake Mead; the potential for loss of hydroelectric generation at Lake Powell; reduced recreational opportunities; and changes to in-stream flows that support ecosystems.\nIn response to drought conditions, Federal agencies and stakeholders throughout the Basin have been working together to find creative ways to reduce the effects of the drought on the people and resources that rely on water from the Colorado River.\nScroll down to learn more about the importance of the Colorado River, the impacts of the current drought, and the ways in which the drought is being managed in the Basin.\nRead More >>\nThe Colorado River is a lifeline.\nWater from the Colorado River is essential for life in parts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. According to the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (2012), the Colorado River and its tributaries:\n Bureau of Reclamation, 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.   \nOne river, two parts.\nApproximately 1,400 miles long and flowing through seven U.S. States and into Mexico, the Colorado River drains roughly one-twelfth of the land area of the contiguous United States. The Colorado River Basin is divided into the Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry Colorado River Compact Point (Compact Point) located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona. The Lower Basin covers parts of Nevada, Arizona, California, southwestern Utah, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to parts of the states of Baja California and Sonora in northwestern Mexico.\n The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies approximately 90 percent of the water for the entire Basin. This water originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains. About 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow, which is surface water that percolates into groundwater aquifers and then resurfaces as streamflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). The Lower Basin is arid, with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  \n The Lower Basin depends upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its surrounding land habitable and productive. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the Basin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hydrologic boundary, including parts of southern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah. In addition, federally recognized Tribes hold a substantial amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries (approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of annual diversion rights).\nResources and facilities, such as dams and power plants, in the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the Law of the River and other project-specific operational guidelines. The Law of the River includes operating criteria, regulations, administrative decisions, Federal statutes, interstate compacts, court decisions and decrees, an international treaty, and contracts with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior (Secretary), and defines the responsibilities of the Secretary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water master role in the Lower Basin.\nRead More >>\nRumsey, C.A., et al. 2015. \"Regional scale estimates of baseflow and factors influencing baseflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin.\" Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 4: 91-107. \nLearn about the Colorado River Basin's network of reservoirs, water delivery infrastructure, and water delivery service areas.\nThe Colorado River is managed with a series of dams and canals that provide flood control, water conservation, and hydropower benefits.\nThe dams and canals in the Colorado River system provide storage for regional water supply, facilitate water deliveries, provide flood control benefits, improve navigation, and generate hydroelectric power. These facilities are operated in coordination with adjacent or nearby water delivery systems that also provide a variety of other economic, cultural, and ecologic benefits.\nIn the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed to control floods, improve navigation and regulate the river's flow, provide water storage and delivery, and generate electric energy. Davis Dam and Parker Dam were constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam. Near the southern end of the system, Imperial Dam serves as the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for the United States, with Morelos Dam diverting Colorado River water into Mexico.  \nWater is released from these facilities to satisfy delivery commitments to users in Nevada, California, Arizona and Mexico, and to generate hydropower with these water releases. Pumping facilities located on Lake Havasu behind Parker Dam divert water to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project.  From Imperial Dam's headworks, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam into Mexico. \nRead More >>\nThe diagram above depicts the major dams, reservoirs, and control structures of the Lower Colorado River.\nView real-time data and take a journey through major dams on the Lower Colorado River.\nWater supply varies over time.\nDue to year-to-year differences in precipitation and snowmelt, the natural water supply of the Basin is highly variable. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate. Since most of the Basin's water supply comes from the Upper Basin, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona, is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this stream gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and river diversions.\nIn the graphic above, the 10-year average natural flow at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average annual flow (approximately 14.8 million acre-feet [maf]). The most recent drought for the 2000-2015 period (indicated by the brown shaded area) was the driest 16-year period in the past 100 years and one of the driest 16-year periods in the past 1,200 years. The graphic also depicts how the early part of the 1900s, which corresponds to the period of reference used to set the apportionments for the Upper and Lower Basins in the 1922 Colorado River Compact, was an unusually wet period (indicated by the green shaded area). At the time the 1922 Colorado River Compact was signed, the average annual inflow at Lees Ferry during the pre-Compact period (1906-1921) was approximately 18.0 maf.\nUSGS observations of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry (USGS site 09380000) have been recorded since 1895. For more information and data on this site, visit the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System Lees Ferry stream gage website. Real-time gage height, discharge, water temperature, sediment, and water-quality properties can be accessed from the U.S. Geological Survey Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center website.\nThe Lees Ferry gage is distinct from the Lee Ferry Compact Point: Lees Ferry refers to the USGS-operated stream gage located near the town of Lees Ferry, Arizona; whereas Lee Ferry refers to the Colorado River Compact Point, as referenced in the 1922 Colorado River Compact. The Lee Ferry Compact Point is located 1 mile downstream of the Lees Ferry gage. \nHistorical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1,200 years, as estimated by Meko et al. (2007a). Because trees grow less during dry years and more during wet years, tree-ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree-ring core samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical natural flow. These estimates were validated using the observed natural flow record developed by the Bureau of Reclamation. \nExplore more about reconstructed natural flow based on tree-ring data.\n 1922 Colorado River Compact.\nBureau of Reclamation. 1922.

Medieval drought in the upper Colorado River Basin. Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, L10705.\nLab of Tree-Ring Research\nThe western U.S. is experiencing an extended drought.\nSince 2000, the Colorado River Basin has experienced the driest 16-year period in over 100 years of historical natural flows (Bureau of Reclamation, 2015).  This period also ranks as the fifth driest 16-year period in the last 1,200 years (Meko et al., 2007a and 2007b).   \nWhile the current drought is severe and historic, the most extreme drought in the Colorado River Basin occurred in the mid-1100s (Meko et al. 2007a). The 1100s drought was characterized by a 25-year period of flows that were 15% lower than the long-term average of 14.8 maf and no higher-flow years (greater than 125% of average) for six decades. By comparison, the current drought is characterized by flows that are 16% lower than the long-term average with one year of higher flows (135% percent of average in 2011).\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor shows the extent and intensity of drought conditions in the Western U.S. from 2000 to 2015.

Medieval drought in the upper Colorado River Basin. Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, L10705.\nThe Colorado River Basin's abundant water storage capacity has made the Southwest more resilient to drought.\nThe basin-wide storage capacity of the Colorado River totals about 60 million acre-feet (maf), approximately four times the average annual inflow in the Upper Basin (14.8 maf). The Basin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead hold about 50 maf combined, which is approximately 83 percent of the total system storage capacity. This large storage capacity creates a buffer against year-to-year hydrologic variability and longer-term drought periods by allowing excess water to be stored during wet years and used during dry years. \nIt is this large amount of basin-wide storage capacity that has allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to meet water delivery requirements during the current drought period. It should be noted, however, that headwater reaches in the Upper Basin can experience localized shortages due to insufficient in-stream flows during dry years.\nThe volume of water that can be stored in the Colorado River system reservoirs (60 million acre-feet) is enough to cover the State of Utah in about 1 foot of water. Dimensions shown above are not to scale.\n Bureau of Reclamation. Colorado River Basin Supply and Demand Study, 2012. \nDevelopment in the West continues, leading to increased water demand in the Colorado River Basin.\nSince the early 1900s, water demand in the Colorado River Basin has increased while water supply has, on average, decreased. For the 16-year period preceding the signing of the 1922 Colorado River Compact, when the beneficial consumptive use of 7.5 million acre-feet (maf) per year was apportioned to both the Upper and Lower Basins, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 18.0 maf (1906-1921). When the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was executed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 maf (1906-1944). The current average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (1906-2015).  \nAs the average annual natural flow has decreased, the difference between water supply and water demand has narrowed and the Colorado River system has been operating on increasingly close margins. As a result of this decrease in natural flows and an increase in water use basin-wide, it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012).\nClimate projections indicate more extreme conditions are possible, with longer, more severe wet and dry periods. Cooperation and collaboration are key to finding sustainable solutions and addressing current and future water resources management challenges.\nRead More >>\nTrends in water supply and water use in the Colorado River Basin are shown above. When water use (red line) exceeds water supply (blue line) in a given year, the amount of water stored is reduced. During the past 20 years, average water supply and average water use have been about equal. Under these conditions, reservoirs are replenished more slowly. Water-supply and water-use data shown in the graphic above are estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation using water accounting information, U.S. Geological Survey stream gage data, and other sources.\nIn this graphic, water use is shown as \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsumptive use\u00e2\u0080\u009d (surface-water diversions and groundwater pumping minus measured and unmeasured return flows) as estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation in its annual water accounting reports. Other estimates of water use that account for withdrawals of surface and groundwater and incorporate water that is used and returned to the stream, are made by the USGS.\nBureau of Reclamation. 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.\nAccess current reservoir conditions in the Upper Basin and Lower Basin.\nBecause of reduced water supply during the current drought, the elevations of Lakes Mead and Powell have declined.\nAs the reservoir levels of Lake Mead and Lake Powell decline, other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and water quality, are also affected.\nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Powell can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps are based on U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June in 1999 and 2014. Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged together to generate cloud-free composite satellite images suitable for measurement and change comparison.\n\t\t \nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Mead can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps were prepared using the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite data as described in the Lake Powell caption above.   \nBetween 2001 and 2015, Lake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elevation dropped from 1,196 to 1,075 feet, a decline of 121 feet. Move the slider on the upper photo to see the decline in the reservoir elevation during this time. The decline in water elevation has exposed a white band of mineralized rock around the shoreline. The declining reservoir level has also exposed portions of Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four intake towers, two on the right side and two on the left side. These intake towers channel water from Lake Mead into penstocks that serve Hoover Dam's 17 hydroelectric generators. Water moves through the generators, creating electricity on the way, and is released back into the Colorado River below the dam. \nThe lower photos show the conditions of Lake Mead and the upstream face of Hoover Dam in 2001 at an elevation of 1,196 feet (left photo) and the conditions in June 2015 at an elevation of 1,075 feet (right photo). The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts. Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). The Bureau of Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with \u00e2\u0080\u009cwide-head\u00e2\u0080\u009d turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant. \nAt Lake Powell, the generating capacity of the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is put at risk by declining reservoir levels. Below an elevation of 3,490 feet, Glen Canyon Dam cannot generate power. Based on a Bureau of Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest that this elevation is projected to occur would be 2019 (there is about a 5 percent chance of this occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water-surface elevation declined to a maximum low elevation of 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, which was approximately 65 feet above the minimum power pool.\nRead More >>\nThe photo slider above shows Hemenway Harbor, located in the southwestern portion of Lake Mead, and the location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,152 feet in January 2003, and the new location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,078 feet in May 2015. The photos also depict the increased exposure of Lake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoreline and the emergence of the Boulder Islands, located on the right side of the photo, as the reservoir elevation has declined.\nLake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s declining reservoir elevation has affected marinas and boat launching facilities at Lake Mead National Recreation Area, requiring the relocation of marinas and the extension of boat ramps to keep recreational facilities open. To continue to provide boat access as reservoir levels have declined, the National Park Service, responsible for the Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2002 and was expected to about spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2007, the Overton Beach Marina became inaccessible by water, and facilities from Overton Beach had to be moved to two other marinas, Callville Bay and Temple Bar. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s to its current location in Hemenway Harbor.\nIn addition to impacting water supply, changing reservoir levels also influence the aquatic ecosystem. Water-level changes and natural disturbances, such as storm events and resulting local runoff, can re-suspend sediments. Because some Lake Mead sediments contain contaminants, re-suspension of sediment may be of concern to ecological health (Rosen et al., 2012).\nRead More >>\nIllia, T. 2010.

Monthly projections made by the Bureau of Reclamation through an operational model called the \"24-Month Study\" are used to set the operational conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.\nContinue with the visualization to learn more about Lake Mead's operational conditions, how operational conditions are determined, and the potential impacts of drought on water deliveries in the Lower Basin.\nThe graphic above shows Lake Mead's historical elevations (on a monthly basis) since 2000, projected elevations for 2016 and 2017, and annual operating conditions. \nAs Lake Mead's elevation declines, the Lower Basin comes closer to its first-ever shortage condition. Since the drought began in 2000, Lake Mead's elevation has dropped by nearly 140 feet, declining every year except in 2005 and 2011. The Bureau of Reclamation makes projections of Lake Mead elevations and summarizes them in the Colorado River Basin 24-Month Study reports. The 24-Month Study model simulates operations of 12 major reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin. The projections are used to support annual and monthly decisions about how to operate the system looking out 1 to 2 years. The annual operating conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell in the upcoming year are based on projected January 1 reservoir elevations from the August 24-Month Study consistent with the 2007 Record of Decision on Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (2007 Interim Guidelines  ). \nThe 24-Month Study utilizes forecasted Upper Basin inflow hydrology (provided by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center), projected reservoir operations, projected diversion and consumptive use schedules, and other factors, to generate a single scenario of potential reservoir conditions.\nThe 2007 Interim Guidelines, adopted in December 2007 and in effect through 2026, provide the approved procedure to determine operating conditions and annual releases from Lake Powell and Lake Mead throughout the full range of reservoir operations. The 2007 Interim Guidelines include criteria for implementing shortage and surplus conditions in the Lower Colorado River Basin. The January 1 projections and resulting annual operation for Lake Mead and Lake Powell are reported in the Annual Operating Plan for Colorado River Reservoirs (AOP) for the upcoming year. Current and previous years' AOPs can be found on the Bureau of Reclamation's website.\n\nRead More >>\nLake Mead\nThe Colorado River is one of the primary sources of water for irrigation and domestic use in Arizona, southern California, southern Nevada, and portions of northwestern Mexico.\nThe Bureau of Reclamation's Lower Colorado Region keeps records of diversions, return flows, and consumptive use of water delivered from the mainstream of the Colorado River below Lees Ferry to entitlement holders within the Lower Colorado River Basin. \nThe pictogram above depicts average consumptive use by select Lower Colorado River water entitlement holders for the 5-year period from 2010-2014. Each blue block represents a volume of 100,000 acre-feet and partially shaded blue blocks represent volumes less than 100,000 acre-feet. Hover over the bars to see the average consumptive use (2010-2014) by select Lower Colorado River entitlement holders (highlighted in green). \nThe pictogram above depicts the elevation range (from approximately 1,200 to 1,229 feet) and annual water deliveries in the Lower Basin when Lake Mead is operating in a Flood Control Surplus Condition. When in flood control, Lake Mead's operations are coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to the 1984 Field Working Agreement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Per the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, when Lake Mead is operating in flood control, an additional 200,000 acre-feet of water will be delivered to Mexico for a total annual delivery of 1.7 million acre-feet. Hover over the blue squares and states to see detailed delivery information. \nA Quantified Surplus Condition or Domestic Surplus Condition exists when Lake Mead's January 1 elevation for the upcoming year is projected to be between 1,145 feet and approximately 1,200 feet.

Activities related to drought response include a system conservation program and drought contingency planning efforts in both the Upper and Lower Basins. Additional ongoing activities are being conducted with stakeholders through the Basin Study Moving Forward process and with Native American Tribes through the Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study. Lastly, the implementation of Minute 319 and related binational discussions also underscore the importance of the partnership and continued collaboration between the United States and Mexico. \nPilot System Conservation Program\n In 2014, an $11 million funding agreement for a  Pilot System Conservation Program (PSCP) was executed among the Bureau of Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD), The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), Denver Water (DW), and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) (the Funding Partners). The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016. The purpose of the PSCP is to explore the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels. All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water. Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing.\nDrought Contingency Planning\nThe Bureau of Reclamation also works with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead. A step forward was a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a Pilot Drought Response Actions signed by the Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies in the Lower Basin States in December 2014. The MOU outlines a commitment by the parties to use best efforts to generate between 1.5 and 3.0 million acre-feet (maf) of additional water in Lake Mead through 2019. The Bureau of Reclamation, MWD, SNWA, and CAWCD have agreed to take first steps to generate 0.740 maf of the additional water by the end of 2017. The MOU is an important first step forward and collaboration continues on potential longer term options.\nIn the Upper Basin, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming are pursuing a plan with three major components: 1) extended operations of the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) reservoirs, 2) voluntary demand management (e.g., fallowing or deficit irrigation), and 3) augmentation (primarily weather modification, such as cloud seeding). The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the Upper Basin CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Upper Basin States are developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement. It is anticipated that these will be completed by the end of 2016.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned activities, Congress has authorized additional funding through the Bureau of Reclamation for drought-related activities to increase Colorado River system water in Lake Mead, Lake Powell, and other Colorado River system reservoirs for the benefit of the system. This authorization requires that a report evaluating the effectiveness of the water conservation pilot projects be submitted to Congress in 2018, including a recommendation on whether the activities undertaken by the pilot projects should be continued. \nThe Moving Forward Effort\nIn May 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation and Basin stakeholders initiated the Moving Forward effort to build on future considerations and next steps identified in the Colorado River Basin Study. The Moving Forward effort enhances the broad, inclusive stakeholder process demonstrated in the Basin Study with an ultimate goal of identifying actionable steps to address projected water supply and demand imbalances that have broad-based support and provide a wide range of benefits. The Moving Forward effort is being conducted in a phased approach. Phase 1 began with the formation of a Coordination Team and three multi-stakeholder workgroups that focus on water conservation, reuse and environmental and recreational flows. In May, 2015 the Phase 1 Report was published, which documents the activities and outcomes of the workgroups during this phase and includes opportunities for potential future action.  \nTribal Water Study\nBegun in late 2013, the Colorado River Basin Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study is a cooperative effort with the Ten Tribes Partnership, whose members hold a significant amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries. The study builds on the technical foundation of the Colorado River Basin Study by further assessing water supplies and demands for these Tribes and identifies tribal opportunities and challenges associated with the development of tribal water. This study is anticipated to be completed in 2016.\nBinational Partnership\nIn November 2012, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. Minute 319 is a 5-year agreement (2013-2017) that provides for a series of joint cooperative actions between the United States and Mexico, including surplus sharing during higher Lake Mead conditions, reduced water deliveries during lower Lake Mead conditions, flexibility with the Intentionally Created Mexican Apportionment mechanism, opportunities for improved and more efficient infrastructure, and water for the environment. In 2014, a pulse flow of approximately 105,000 acre-feet was delivered to Mexico from March 23 through May 18 to benefit the riparian ecosystem in the Colorado River Delta. Implementation of the pulse flow also involved a monitoring component conducted by scientists and experts from the United States and Mexico to determine the environmental benefits of the pulse flow and the overall performance of the pilot project. With the success of the binational implementation of this project, the United States and Mexico hope to develop a new binational agreement in the spirit of continued collaboration to meet future water resources management challenges ahead. \nRead More >>\nBureau of Reclamation System Conservation Pilot Program.

      "Drought in the Colorado River Basin\nInsights using open data\nSince 2000, the Colorado River Basin (Basin) has been experiencing a historic, extended drought that has impacted regional water supply and other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and ecologic services. During this time, the Basin has experienced its lowest 16-year period of inflow in over 100 years of record keeping, and reservoir storage in the Colorado River system has declined from nearly full to about half of capacity. \nThis application was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation in support of the Department of the Interior\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Open Water Data Initiative (OWDI). This visualization is part of a multi-agency effort to showcase the usefulness of open data (i.e., data provided in a discoverable, sharable, and machine-readable format) by exploring the current 16-year drought and its effects on the Colorado River Basin. \nConcern is growing about the impacts of the ongoing drought and declining reservoir levels, such as decreasing water supply and the possibility of a first-ever shortage condition of drinking water for the Lower Basin; decreasing hydropower capacities at Lake Powell and Lake Mead; the potential for loss of hydroelectric generation at Lake Powell; reduced recreational opportunities; and changes to in-stream flows that support ecosystems.\nIn response to drought conditions, Federal agencies and stakeholders throughout the Basin have been working together to find creative ways to reduce the effects of the drought on the people and resources that rely on water from the Colorado River.\nScroll down to learn more about the importance of the Colorado River, the impacts of the current drought, and the ways in which the drought is being managed in the Basin.\nRead More >>\nThe Colorado River is a lifeline.\nWater from the Colorado River is essential for life in parts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. According to the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (2012), the Colorado River and its tributaries:\n Bureau of Reclamation, 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.   \nOne river, two parts.\nApproximately 1,400 miles long and flowing through seven U.S. States and into Mexico, the Colorado River drains roughly one-twelfth of the land area of the contiguous United States. The Colorado River Basin is divided into the Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry Colorado River Compact Point (Compact Point) located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona. The Lower Basin covers parts of Nevada, Arizona, California, southwestern Utah, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to parts of the states of Baja California and Sonora in northwestern Mexico.\n The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies approximately 90 percent of the water for the entire Basin. This water originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains. About 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow, which is surface water that percolates into groundwater aquifers and then resurfaces as streamflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). The Lower Basin is arid, with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  \n The Lower Basin depends upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its surrounding land habitable and productive. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the Basin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hydrologic boundary, including parts of southern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah. In addition, federally recognized Tribes hold a substantial amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries (approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of annual diversion rights).\nResources and facilities, such as dams and power plants, in the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the Law of the River and other project-specific operational guidelines. The Law of the River includes operating criteria, regulations, administrative decisions, Federal statutes, interstate compacts, court decisions and decrees, an international treaty, and contracts with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior (Secretary), and defines the responsibilities of the Secretary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water master role in the Lower Basin.\nRead More >>\nRumsey, C.A., et al. 2015. \"Regional scale estimates of baseflow and factors influencing baseflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin.\" Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 4: 91-107. \nLearn about the Colorado River Basin's network of reservoirs, water delivery infrastructure, and water delivery service areas.\nThe Colorado River is managed with a series of dams and canals that provide flood control, water conservation, and hydropower benefits.\nThe dams and canals in the Colorado River system provide storage for regional water supply, facilitate water deliveries, provide flood control benefits, improve navigation, and generate hydroelectric power. These facilities are operated in coordination with adjacent or nearby water delivery systems that also provide a variety of other economic, cultural, and ecologic benefits.\nIn the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed to control floods, improve navigation and regulate the river's flow, provide water storage and delivery, and generate electric energy. Davis Dam and Parker Dam were constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam. Near the southern end of the system, Imperial Dam serves as the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for the United States, with Morelos Dam diverting Colorado River water into Mexico.  \nWater is released from these facilities to satisfy delivery commitments to users in Nevada, California, Arizona and Mexico, and to generate hydropower with these water releases. Pumping facilities located on Lake Havasu behind Parker Dam divert water to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project.  From Imperial Dam's headworks, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam into Mexico. \nRead More >>\nThe diagram above depicts the major dams, reservoirs, and control structures of the Lower Colorado River.\nView real-time data and take a journey through major dams on the Lower Colorado River.\nWater supply varies over time.\nDue to year-to-year differences in precipitation and snowmelt, the natural water supply of the Basin is highly variable. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate. Since most of the Basin's water supply comes from the Upper Basin, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona, is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this stream gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and river diversions.\nIn the graphic above, the 10-year average natural flow at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average annual flow (approximately 14.8 million acre-feet [maf]). The most recent drought for the 2000-2015 period (indicated by the brown shaded area) was the driest 16-year period in the past 100 years and one of the driest 16-year periods in the past 1,200 years. The graphic also depicts how the early part of the 1900s, which corresponds to the period of reference used to set the apportionments for the Upper and Lower Basins in the 1922 Colorado River Compact, was an unusually wet period (indicated by the green shaded area). At the time the 1922 Colorado River Compact was signed, the average annual inflow at Lees Ferry during the pre-Compact period (1906-1921) was approximately 18.0 maf.\nUSGS observations of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry (USGS site 09380000) have been recorded since 1895. For more information and data on this site, visit the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System Lees Ferry stream gage website. Real-time gage height, discharge, water temperature, sediment, and water-quality properties can be accessed from the U.S. Geological Survey Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center website.\nThe Lees Ferry gage is distinct from the Lee Ferry Compact Point: Lees Ferry refers to the USGS-operated stream gage located near the town of Lees Ferry, Arizona; whereas Lee Ferry refers to the Colorado River Compact Point, as referenced in the 1922 Colorado River Compact. The Lee Ferry Compact Point is located 1 mile downstream of the Lees Ferry gage. \nHistorical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1,200 years, as estimated by Meko et al. (2007a). Because trees grow less during dry years and more during wet years, tree-ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree-ring core samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical natural flow. These estimates were validated using the observed natural flow record developed by the Bureau of Reclamation. \nExplore more about reconstructed natural flow based on tree-ring data.\n 1922 Colorado River Compact.\nBureau of Reclamation. 1922.

Medieval drought in the upper Colorado River Basin. Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, L10705.\nLab of Tree-Ring Research\nThe western U.S. is experiencing an extended drought.\nSince 2000, the Colorado River Basin has experienced the driest 16-year period in over 100 years of historical natural flows (Bureau of Reclamation, 2015).  This period also ranks as the fifth driest 16-year period in the last 1,200 years (Meko et al., 2007a and 2007b).   \nWhile the current drought is severe and historic, the most extreme drought in the Colorado River Basin occurred in the mid-1100s (Meko et al. 2007a). The 1100s drought was characterized by a 25-year period of flows that were 15% lower than the long-term average of 14.8 maf and no higher-flow years (greater than 125% of average) for six decades. By comparison, the current drought is characterized by flows that are 16% lower than the long-term average with one year of higher flows (135% percent of average in 2011).\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor shows the extent and intensity of drought conditions in the Western U.S. from 2000 to 2015. The Esri  Drought Tracker provides a means to view drought conditions in the U.S. over time, using data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.\n\nView more information about drought in the U.S. and Colorado River Basin. \nBureau of Reclamation, 2015.

Medieval drought in the upper Colorado River Basin. Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, L10705.\nThe Colorado River Basin's abundant water storage capacity has made the Southwest more resilient to drought.\nThe basin-wide storage capacity of the Colorado River totals about 60 million acre-feet (maf), approximately four times the average annual inflow in the Upper Basin (14.8 maf). The Basin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead hold about 50 maf combined, which is approximately 83 percent of the total system storage capacity. This large storage capacity creates a buffer against year-to-year hydrologic variability and longer-term drought periods by allowing excess water to be stored during wet years and used during dry years. \nIt is this large amount of basin-wide storage capacity that has allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to meet water delivery requirements during the current drought period. It should be noted, however, that headwater reaches in the Upper Basin can experience localized shortages due to insufficient in-stream flows during dry years.\nThe volume of water that can be stored in the Colorado River system reservoirs (60 million acre-feet) is enough to cover the State of Utah in about 1 foot of water. Dimensions shown above are not to scale.\n Bureau of Reclamation. Colorado River Basin Supply and Demand Study, 2012. \nDevelopment in the West continues, leading to increased water demand in the Colorado River Basin.\nSince the early 1900s, water demand in the Colorado River Basin has increased while water supply has, on average, decreased. For the 16-year period preceding the signing of the 1922 Colorado River Compact, when the beneficial consumptive use of 7.5 million acre-feet (maf) per year was apportioned to both the Upper and Lower Basins, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 18.0 maf (1906-1921). When the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was executed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 maf (1906-1944). The current average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (1906-2015).  \nAs the average annual natural flow has decreased, the difference between water supply and water demand has narrowed and the Colorado River system has been operating on increasingly close margins. As a result of this decrease in natural flows and an increase in water use basin-wide, it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012).\nClimate projections indicate more extreme conditions are possible, with longer, more severe wet and dry periods. Cooperation and collaboration are key to finding sustainable solutions and addressing current and future water resources management challenges.\nRead More >>\nTrends in water supply and water use in the Colorado River Basin are shown above. When water use (red line) exceeds water supply (blue line) in a given year, the amount of water stored is reduced. During the past 20 years, average water supply and average water use have been about equal. Under these conditions, reservoirs are replenished more slowly. Water-supply and water-use data shown in the graphic above are estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation using water accounting information, U.S. Geological Survey stream gage data, and other sources.\nIn this graphic, water use is shown as \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsumptive use\u00e2\u0080\u009d (surface-water diversions and groundwater pumping minus measured and unmeasured return flows) as estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation in its annual water accounting reports. Other estimates of water use that account for withdrawals of surface and groundwater and incorporate water that is used and returned to the stream, are made by the USGS.\nBureau of Reclamation. 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.\nAccess current reservoir conditions in the Upper Basin and Lower Basin.\nBecause of reduced water supply during the current drought, the elevations of Lakes Mead and Powell have declined.\nAs the reservoir levels of Lake Mead and Lake Powell decline, other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and water quality, are also affected.\nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Powell can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps are based on U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June in 1999 and 2014. Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged together to generate cloud-free composite satellite images suitable for measurement and change comparison.\n\t\t \nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Mead can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps were prepared using the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite data as described in the Lake Powell caption above.   \nBetween 2001 and 2015, Lake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elevation dropped from 1,196 to 1,075 feet, a decline of 121 feet. Move the slider on the upper photo to see the decline in the reservoir elevation during this time. The decline in water elevation has exposed a white band of mineralized rock around the shoreline. The declining reservoir level has also exposed portions of Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four intake towers, two on the right side and two on the left side. These intake towers channel water from Lake Mead into penstocks that serve Hoover Dam's 17 hydroelectric generators. Water moves through the generators, creating electricity on the way, and is released back into the Colorado River below the dam. \nThe lower photos show the conditions of Lake Mead and the upstream face of Hoover Dam in 2001 at an elevation of 1,196 feet (left photo) and the conditions in June 2015 at an elevation of 1,075 feet (right photo). The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts. Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). The Bureau of Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with \u00e2\u0080\u009cwide-head\u00e2\u0080\u009d turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant. \nAt Lake Powell, the generating capacity of the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is put at risk by declining reservoir levels. Below an elevation of 3,490 feet, Glen Canyon Dam cannot generate power. Based on a Bureau of Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest that this elevation is projected to occur would be 2019 (there is about a 5 percent chance of this occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water-surface elevation declined to a maximum low elevation of 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, which was approximately 65 feet above the minimum power pool.\nRead More >>\nThe photo slider above shows Hemenway Harbor, located in the southwestern portion of Lake Mead, and the location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,152 feet in January 2003, and the new location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,078 feet in May 2015. The photos also depict the increased exposure of Lake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoreline and the emergence of the Boulder Islands, located on the right side of the photo, as the reservoir elevation has declined.\nLake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s declining reservoir elevation has affected marinas and boat launching facilities at Lake Mead National Recreation Area, requiring the relocation of marinas and the extension of boat ramps to keep recreational facilities open. To continue to provide boat access as reservoir levels have declined, the National Park Service, responsible for the Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2002 and was expected to about spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2007, the Overton Beach Marina became inaccessible by water, and facilities from Overton Beach had to be moved to two other marinas, Callville Bay and Temple Bar. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s to its current location in Hemenway Harbor.\nIn addition to impacting water supply, changing reservoir levels also influence the aquatic ecosystem. Water-level changes and natural disturbances, such as storm events and resulting local runoff, can re-suspend sediments. Because some Lake Mead sediments contain contaminants, re-suspension of sediment may be of concern to ecological health (Rosen et al., 2012).\nRead More >>\nIllia, T. 2010.

Monthly projections made by the Bureau of Reclamation through an operational model called the \"24-Month Study\" are used to set the operational conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.\nContinue with the visualization to learn more about Lake Mead's operational conditions, how operational conditions are determined, and the potential impacts of drought on water deliveries in the Lower Basin.\nThe graphic above shows Lake Mead's historical elevations (on a monthly basis) since 2000, projected elevations for 2016 and 2017, and annual operating conditions. \nAs Lake Mead's elevation declines, the Lower Basin comes closer to its first-ever shortage condition. Since the drought began in 2000, Lake Mead's elevation has dropped by nearly 140 feet, declining every year except in 2005 and 2011. The Bureau of Reclamation makes projections of Lake Mead elevations and summarizes them in the Colorado River Basin 24-Month Study reports. The 24-Month Study model simulates operations of 12 major reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin. The projections are used to support annual and monthly decisions about how to operate the system looking out 1 to 2 years. The annual operating conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell in the upcoming year are based on projected January 1 reservoir elevations from the August 24-Month Study consistent with the 2007 Record of Decision on Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (2007 Interim Guidelines  ). \nThe 24-Month Study utilizes forecasted Upper Basin inflow hydrology (provided by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center), projected reservoir operations, projected diversion and consumptive use schedules, and other factors, to generate a single scenario of potential reservoir conditions.\nThe 2007 Interim Guidelines, adopted in December 2007 and in effect through 2026, provide the approved procedure to determine operating conditions and annual releases from Lake Powell and Lake Mead throughout the full range of reservoir operations. The 2007 Interim Guidelines include criteria for implementing shortage and surplus conditions in the Lower Colorado River Basin. The January 1 projections and resulting annual operation for Lake Mead and Lake Powell are reported in the Annual Operating Plan for Colorado River Reservoirs (AOP) for the upcoming year. Current and previous years' AOPs can be found on the Bureau of Reclamation's website.\n\nRead More >>\nLake Mead\nThe Colorado River is one of the primary sources of water for irrigation and domestic use in Arizona, southern California, southern Nevada, and portions of northwestern Mexico.\nThe Bureau of Reclamation's Lower Colorado Region keeps records of diversions, return flows, and consumptive use of water delivered from the mainstream of the Colorado River below Lees Ferry to entitlement holders within the Lower Colorado River Basin. \nThe pictogram above depicts average consumptive use by select Lower Colorado River water entitlement holders for the 5-year period from 2010-2014. Each blue block represents a volume of 100,000 acre-feet and partially shaded blue blocks represent volumes less than 100,000 acre-feet. Hover over the bars to see the average consumptive use (2010-2014) by select Lower Colorado River entitlement holders (highlighted in green). \nThe pictogram above depicts the elevation range (from approximately 1,200 to 1,229 feet) and annual water deliveries in the Lower Basin when Lake Mead is operating in a Flood Control Surplus Condition. When in flood control, Lake Mead's operations are coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to the 1984 Field Working Agreement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Per the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, when Lake Mead is operating in flood control, an additional 200,000 acre-feet of water will be delivered to Mexico for a total annual delivery of 1.7 million acre-feet. Hover over the blue squares and states to see detailed delivery information. \nA Quantified Surplus Condition or Domestic Surplus Condition exists when Lake Mead's January 1 elevation for the upcoming year is projected to be between 1,145 feet and approximately 1,200 feet.

Activities related to drought response include a system conservation program and drought contingency planning efforts in both the Upper and Lower Basins. Additional ongoing activities are being conducted with stakeholders through the Basin Study Moving Forward process and with Native American Tribes through the Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study. Lastly, the implementation of Minute 319 and related binational discussions also underscore the importance of the partnership and continued collaboration between the United States and Mexico. \nPilot System Conservation Program\n In 2014, an $11 million funding agreement for a  Pilot System Conservation Program (PSCP) was executed among the Bureau of Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD), The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), Denver Water (DW), and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) (the Funding Partners). The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016. The purpose of the PSCP is to explore the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels. All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water. Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing.\nDrought Contingency Planning\nThe Bureau of Reclamation also works with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead. A step forward was a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a Pilot Drought Response Actions signed by the Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies in the Lower Basin States in December 2014. The MOU outlines a commitment by the parties to use best efforts to generate between 1.5 and 3.0 million acre-feet (maf) of additional water in Lake Mead through 2019. The Bureau of Reclamation, MWD, SNWA, and CAWCD have agreed to take first steps to generate 0.740 maf of the additional water by the end of 2017. The MOU is an important first step forward and collaboration continues on potential longer term options.\nIn the Upper Basin, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming are pursuing a plan with three major components: 1) extended operations of the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) reservoirs, 2) voluntary demand management (e.g., fallowing or deficit irrigation), and 3) augmentation (primarily weather modification, such as cloud seeding). The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the Upper Basin CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Upper Basin States are developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement. It is anticipated that these will be completed by the end of 2016.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned activities, Congress has authorized additional funding through the Bureau of Reclamation for drought-related activities to increase Colorado River system water in Lake Mead, Lake Powell, and other Colorado River system reservoirs for the benefit of the system. This authorization requires that a report evaluating the effectiveness of the water conservation pilot projects be submitted to Congress in 2018, including a recommendation on whether the activities undertaken by the pilot projects should be continued. \nThe Moving Forward Effort\nIn May 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation and Basin stakeholders initiated the Moving Forward effort to build on future considerations and next steps identified in the Colorado River Basin Study. The Moving Forward effort enhances the broad, inclusive stakeholder process demonstrated in the Basin Study with an ultimate goal of identifying actionable steps to address projected water supply and demand imbalances that have broad-based support and provide a wide range of benefits. The Moving Forward effort is being conducted in a phased approach. Phase 1 began with the formation of a Coordination Team and three multi-stakeholder workgroups that focus on water conservation, reuse and environmental and recreational flows. In May, 2015 the Phase 1 Report was published, which documents the activities and outcomes of the workgroups during this phase and includes opportunities for potential future action.  \nTribal Water Study\nBegun in late 2013, the Colorado River Basin Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study is a cooperative effort with the Ten Tribes Partnership, whose members hold a significant amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries. The study builds on the technical foundation of the Colorado River Basin Study by further assessing water supplies and demands for these Tribes and identifies tribal opportunities and challenges associated with the development of tribal water. This study is anticipated to be completed in 2016.\nBinational Partnership\nIn November 2012, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. Minute 319 is a 5-year agreement (2013-2017) that provides for a series of joint cooperative actions between the United States and Mexico, including surplus sharing during higher Lake Mead conditions, reduced water deliveries during lower Lake Mead conditions, flexibility with the Intentionally Created Mexican Apportionment mechanism, opportunities for improved and more efficient infrastructure, and water for the environment. In 2014, a pulse flow of approximately 105,000 acre-feet was delivered to Mexico from March 23 through May 18 to benefit the riparian ecosystem in the Colorado River Delta. Implementation of the pulse flow also involved a monitoring component conducted by scientists and experts from the United States and Mexico to determine the environmental benefits of the pulse flow and the overall performance of the pilot project. With the success of the binational implementation of this project, the United States and Mexico hope to develop a new binational agreement in the spirit of continued collaboration to meet future water resources management challenges ahead. \nRead More >>\nBureau of Reclamation System Conservation Pilot Program.

See Guide to this Report for more on\nassessments of likelihood and confidence.\n6.0: Introduction\nTemperature is among the most important climatic elements used in\ndecision-making. For example, builders and insurers use temperature\ndata for planning and risk management while energy companies and\nregulators use temperature data to predict demand and set utility\nrates. Temperature is also a key indicator of climate change: recent\nincreases are apparent over the land, ocean, and troposphere, and\nsubstantial changes are expected for this century. This chapter\nsummarizes the major observed and projected changes in near-surface\nair temperature over the United States, emphasizing new data sets\nand model projections since the Third National Climate Assessment\n(NCA3). Changes are depicted using a spectrum of observations,\nincluding surface weather stations, moored ocean buoys, polar-orbiting\nsatellites, and temperature-sensitive proxies. Projections are based\non global models and downscaled products from CMIP5 (Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5) using a suite of Representative\nConcentration Pathways (RCPs; see Ch. 4: Projections for more on\nRCPs and future scenarios).\n6.1: Historical Changes\n6.1.1 Average Temperatures\nChanges in average temperature are described using a suite of\nobservational datasets. As in NCA3, changes in land temperature are\nassessed using the nClimGrid dataset.1\n,2\nAlong U.S. coastlines,\nchanges in sea surface temperatures are quantified using a new\nreconstruction3\nthat forms the ocean component of the NOAA Global Temperature\ndataset.4\nChanges in middle tropospheric temperature are examined using updated\nversions of multiple satellite datasets.5\n,6\n,7\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States has\nrisen since the start of the 20th century. In general, temperature\nincreased until about 1940, decreased until about 1970, and increased\nrapidly through 2016. Because the increase was not constant over\ntime, multiple methods were evaluated in this report (as in NCA3)\nto quantify the trend. All methods yielded rates of warming that\nwere significant at the 95% level. The lowest estimate of 1.2\u00b0F\n(0.7\u00b0C) was obtained by computing the difference between the average\nfor 1986\u20132016 (i.e., present-day) and the average for 1901\u20131960\n(i.e., the first half of the last century). The highest estimate\nof 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) was obtained by fitting a linear (least-squares)\nregression line through the period 1895\u20132016. Thus, the temperature\nincrease cited in this assessment is 1.2\u00b0\u20131.8\u00b0F (0.7\u00b0\u20131.0\u00b0C).\nThis increase is about 0.1\u00b0F (0.06\u00b0C) less than presented in NCA3,\nand it results from the use of slightly different periods in each\nreport. In particular, the decline in the lower bound stems from\nthe use of different time periods to represent present-day climate\n(NCA3 used 1991\u20132012, which was slightly warmer than the 1986\u20132016\nperiod used here). The decline in the upper bound stems mainly from\ntemperature differences late in the record (e.g., the last year of\ndata available for NCA3 was 2012, which was the warmest year on\nrecord for the contiguous United States).\nEach NCA region experienced a net warming through 2016 (Table 6.1).\nThe largest changes were in the western United States, where average\ntemperature increased by more than 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in Alaska, the\nNorthwest, the Southwest, and also in the Northern Great Plains.\nAs noted in NCA3, the Southeast had the least warming, driven by a\ncombination of natural variations and human influences.8\nIn most regions, average\nminimum temperature increased at a slightly higher rate than average\nmaximum temperature, with the Midwest having the largest discrepancy,\nand the Southwest and Northwest having the smallest. This differential\nrate of warming resulted in a continuing decrease in the diurnal\ntemperature range that is consistent with other parts of the globe.9\nAnnual average\nsea surface temperature also increased along all regional coastlines\n(see Figure 1.3), though changes were generally smaller than over\nland owing to the higher heat capacity of water. Increases were\nlargest in Alaska (greater than 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]) while increases\nwere smallest (less than 0.5\u00b0F [0.3\u00b0C]) in coastal areas of the\nSoutheast.\nMore than 95% of the land surface of the contiguous United States\nhad an increase in annual average temperature (Figure 6.1). In\ncontrast, only small (and somewhat dispersed) parts of the Southeast\nand Southern Great Plains experienced cooling. From a seasonal\nperspective, warming was greatest and most widespread in winter,\nwith increases of over 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in most areas. In summer,\nwarming was less extensive (mainly along the East Coast and in the\nwestern third of the Nation), while cooling was evident in parts\nof the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains.\nFigure 6.1\nObserved changes in annual, winter, and summer temperature (\u00b0F). Changes are the difference\nbetween the average for present-day (1986\u20132016) and the average for the first half of\nthe last century (1901\u20131960 for the contiguous United States, 1925\u20131960 for Alaska and Hawai\u2018i).\nEstimates are derived from the nClimDiv dataset.\n1\n,2\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nThere has been a rapid increase in the average temperature of the\ncontiguous United States over the past several decades. There is\ngeneral consistency on this point between the surface thermometer\nrecord from NOAA1\nand the middle tropospheric satellite records from Remote Sensing\nSystems (RSS),5\nNOAA\u2019s Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR),7\nand the University\nof Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).6\nIn particular, for the\nperiod 1979\u20132016, the rate of warming in the surface record was\n0.512\u00b0F (0.284\u00b0C) per decade, versus trends of 0.455\u00b0F (0.253\u00b0C),\n0.421\u00b0F (0.234\u00b0C), and 0.289\u00b0F (0.160 \u00b0C) per decade for RSS version\n4, STAR version 3, and UAH version 6, respectively (after accounting\nfor stratospheric influences). All trends are statistically significant\nat the 95% level. For the contiguous United States, the year 2016\nwas the second-warmest on record at the surface and in the middle\ntroposphere (2012 was the warmest year at the surface, and 2015 was\nthe warmest in the middle troposphere). Generally speaking, surface\nand satellite records do not have identical trends because they do\nnot represent the same physical quantity; surface measurements are\nmade using thermometers in shelters about 1.5 meters above the\nground whereas satellite measurements are mass-weighted averages\nof microwave emissions from deep atmospheric layers. The UAH record\nlikely has a lower trend because it differs from the other satellite\nproducts in the treatment of target temperatures from the NOAA-9\nsatellite as well as in the correction for diurnal drift.10\nRecent paleo-temperature evidence confirms the unusual character\nof wide-scale warming during the past few decades as determined\nfrom the instrumental record. The most important new paleoclimate\nstudy since NCA3 showed that for each of the seven continental\nregions, the reconstructed area-weighted average temperature for\n1971\u20132000 was higher than for any other time in nearly 1,400 years,11\nalthough with\nsignificant uncertainty around the central estimate that leads to\nthis conclusion. Recent (up to 2006) 30-year smoothed temperatures\nacross temperate North America (including most of the continental\nUnited States) are similarly reconstructed as the warmest over the\npast 1,500 years12\n(Figure 6.2). Unlike the PAGES 2k seven-continent result mentioned\nabove, this conclusion for North America is robust in relation to\nthe estimated uncertainty range. Reconstruction data since 1500 for\nwestern temperate North America show the same conclusion at the\nannual time scale for 1986\u20132005. This time period and the running\n20-year periods thereafter are warmer than all possible continuous\n20-year sequences in a 1,000-member statistical reconstruction\nensemble.13\n6.1.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.2\nPollen-based temperature reconstruction for temperate North America.\nThe blue curve depicts the pollen-based reconstruction of 30-year\naverages (as anomalies from 1904 to 1980) for the temperate region\n(30\u00b0\u201355\u00b0N, 75\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0W). The red curve shows the corresponding tree\nring-based decadal average reconstruction, which was smoothed and\nused to calibrate the lower-frequency pollen-based estimate. Light\n(medium) blue zones indicate 2 standard error (1 standard error)\nuncertainty estimations associated with each 30-year value. The\nblack curve shows comparably smoothed instrumental temperature\nvalues up to 1980. The dashed black line represents the average\ntemperature anomaly of comparably smoothed instrumental data for\nthe period 2000\u20132006. (Figure source: NOAA NCEI).\nShifts in temperature extremes are examined using a suite of\nsocietally relevant climate change indices14\n,15\nderived from long-term\nobservations of daily surface temperature.16\nThe coldest and warmest\ntemperatures of the year are of particular relevance given their\nwidespread use in engineering, agricultural, and other sectoral\napplications (for example, extreme annual design conditions by the\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning;\nplant hardiness zones by the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Cold\nwaves and heat waves (that is, extended periods of below or above\nnormal temperature) are likewise of great importance because of\ntheir numerous societal and environmental impacts, which span from\nhuman health to plant and animal phenology. Changes are considered\nfor a spectrum of event frequencies and intensities, ranging from\nthe typical annual extreme to the 1-in-10 year event (an extreme\nthat only has a 10% chance of occurrence in any given year). The\ndiscussion focuses on the contiguous United States; Alaska, Hawai\u2018i,\nand the Caribbean do not have a sufficient number of long-term\nstations for a century-scale analysis.\nCold extremes have become less severe over the past century. For\nexample, the coldest daily temperature of the year has increased\nat most locations in the contiguous United States (Figure 6.3). All\nregions experienced net increases (Table 6.2), with the largest\nrises in the Northern Great Plains and the Northwest (roughly 4.5\u00b0F\n[2.5\u00b0C]), and the smallest in the Southeast (about 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]).\nIn general, there were increases throughout the record, with a\nslight acceleration in recent decades (Figure 6.3). The temperature\nof extremely cold days (1-in-10 year events) generally exhibited\nthe same pattern of increases as the coldest daily temperature of\nthe year. Consistent with these increases, the number of cool nights\nper year (those with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile\nfor 1961\u20131990) declined in all regions, with much of the West having\ndecreases of roughly two weeks. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile for\n1961\u20131990) has fallen over the past century (Figure 6.4). The\nfrequency of intense cold waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) peaked\nin the 1980s and then reached record-low levels in the 2000s.17\nFigure 6.3\nObserved changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures (\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States.\nMaps (top) depict changes at stations; changes are the difference between the average for present-day (1986\u20132016)\nand the average for the first half of the last century (1901\u20131960). Time series (bottom) depict the area-weighted\naverage for the contiguous United States. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with minimal missing data\nin the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily dataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nFigure 6.4\nObserved changes in cold and heat waves in the contiguous United States. The top panel depicts changes\nin the frequency of cold waves; the middle panel depicts changes in the frequency of heat waves; and the\nbottom panel depicts changes in the intensity of heat waves. Cold and heat wave frequency indices are\ndefined in Zhang et al.,15\nand the heat wave\nintensity index is defined in Russo et al.14\nEstimates are\nderived from long-term stations with minimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in warm extremes are more nuanced than changes in cold\nextremes. For instance, the warmest daily temperature of the year\nincreased in some parts of the West over the past century (Figure\n6.3), but there were decreases in almost all locations east of the\nRocky Mountains. In fact, all eastern regions experienced a net\ndecrease (Table 6.2), most notably the Midwest (about 2.2\u00b0F [1.2\u00b0C])\nand the Southeast (roughly 1.5\u00b0F [0.8\u00b0C]). The decreases in the\neastern half of Nation, particularly in the Great Plains, are mainly\ntied to the unprecedented summer heat of the 1930s Dust Bowl era,\nwhich was exacerbated by land-surface feedbacks driven by springtime\nprecipitation deficits and land mismanagement.18\nHowever, anthropogenic\naerosol forcing may also have reduced summer temperatures in the\nNortheast and Southeast from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s,19\nand agricultural\nintensification may have suppressed the hottest extremes in the\nMidwest.20\nSince the mid-1960s, there has been only a very slight increase in\nthe warmest daily temperature of the year (amidst large interannual\nvariability). Heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile for 1961\u20131990) increased in frequency\nuntil the mid-1930s, became considerably less common through the\nmid-1960s, and increased in frequency again thereafter (Figure 6.4).\nAs with warm daily temperatures, heat wave magnitude reached a\nmaximum in the 1930s. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day,\n1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most\nregions except the Midwest and the Great Plains.17\n,21\nSince the early 1980s\n(Figure 6.4), there is suggestive evidence of a slight increase in\nthe intensity of heat waves nationwide14\nas well as an increase\nin the concurrence of droughts and heat waves.22\nFigure 6.5\nObserved changes in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures\nin the contiguous United States. Red bars indicate a year with more\ndaily record highs than daily record lows, while blue bars indicate\na year with more record lows than highs. The height of the bar\nindicates the ratio of record highs to lows (red) or of record lows\nto highs (blue). For example, a ratio of 2:1 for a blue bar means\nthat there were twice as many record daily lows as daily record\nhighs that year. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with\nminimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures are\nalso apparent. Very generally, the number of record lows has been\ndeclining since the late-1970s while the number of record highs has\nbeen rising.23\nBy extension, there has been an increase in the ratio of the\nnumber of record highs to record lows (Figure 6.5). Over the past\ntwo decades, the average of this ratio exceeds two (meaning that\ntwice as many high-temperature records have been set as low-temperature\nrecords). The number of new highs has surpassed the number of new\nlows in 15 of the last 20 years, with 2012 and 2016 being particularly\nextreme (ratios of seven and five, respectively).\n6.2: Detection and Attribution\n6.2.1\nAverage Temperatures\nWhile a confident attribution of global temperature increases to\nanthropogenic forcing has been made,24\ndetection and attribution\nassessment statements for smaller regions are generally much weaker.\nNevertheless, some detectable anthropogenic influences on average\ntemperature have been reported for North America and parts of the\nUnited States (e.g., Christidis et al. 2010;25\nBonfils et al. 2008;26\nPierce et al.\n200927\n).\nFigure 6.6 shows an example for linear trends for 1901\u20132015,\nindicating a detectable anthropogenic warming since 1901 over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States for\nthe CMIP5 multimodel ensemble\u2014a condition that was also met for\nmost of the individual models.28\nThe Southeast stands out\nas the only region with no \u201cdetectable\u201d warming since 1901; observed\ntrends there were inconsistent with CMIP5 All Forcing historical\nruns.28\nThe\ncause of this \u201cwarming hole,\u201d or lack of a long-term warming trend,\nremains uncertain, though it is likely a combination of natural and\nhuman causes. Some studies conclude that changes in anthropogenic\naerosols have played a crucial role (e.g., Leibensperger et al.\n2012a,b;29\n,30\nYu et al. 201431\n), whereas other studies infer a possible large role for atmospheric\ncirculation,32\ninternal climate variability (e.g., Meehl et al. 2012;8\nKnutson et al.\n2013a28\n), and\nchanges in land use (e.g., Goldstein et al. 2009;33\nXu et al. 201534\n). Notably, the\nSoutheast has been warming rapidly since the early 1960s.35\n,36\nIn summary, there\nis medium confidence for detectable anthropogenic warming over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States.\nFigure 6.6\nDetection and attribution assessment of trends in annual average\ntemperature (\u00b0F). Grid-box values indicate whether linear trends\nfor 1901\u20132015 are detectable (that is, distinct from natural\nvariability) and/or consistent with CMIP5 historical All-Forcing\nruns. If the grid-box trend is found to be both detectable and\neither consistent with or greater than the warming in the All-Forcing\nruns, then the grid box is assessed as having a detectable anthropogenic\ncontribution to warming over the period. Gray regions represent\ngrid boxes with data that are too sparse for detection and attribution.\n(Figure source: updated from Knutson et al. 2013;28\n\u00a9 American Meteorological\nSociety. Used with permission.)\n6.2.2\nTemperature Extremes\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC\u2019s) Fifth\nAssessment Report (AR5)24\nconcluded that it is very likely that human influence has\ncontributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of\ntemperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\nThe combined influence of anthropogenic and natural forcings was\nalso detectable (medium confidence) over large subregions of North\nAmerica (e.g., Zwiers et al. 2011;37\nMin et al. 201338\n). In general,\nhowever, results for the contiguous United States are not as\ncompelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of\nchanges in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme\ntemperature in the 1930s.17\nTable 6.3 summarizes\navailable attribution statements for recent extreme U.S. temperature\nevents. As an example, the recent record or near-record high March\u2013May\naverage temperatures occurring in 2012 over the eastern United\nStates were attributed in part to external (natural plus anthropogenic)\nforcing;39\nthe century-scale trend response of temperature to external forcing\nis typically a close approximation to the anthropogenic forcing\nresponse alone. Another study found that although the extreme March\n2012 warm anomalies over the United States were mostly due to natural\nvariability, anthropogenic warming contributed to the severity.40\nSuch statements\nreveal that both natural and anthropogenic factors influence the\nseverity of extreme temperature events. Nearly every modern analysis\nof current extreme hot and cold events reveals some degree of\nattributable human influence.\n6.3: Projected Changes\n6.3.1 Average Temperatures\nTemperature projections are based on global model results and\nassociated downscaled products from CMIP5 using a suite of\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In contrast to NCA3,\nmodel weighting is employed to refine projections of temperature\nfor each RCP (Ch. 4: Projections; Appendix B: Model Weighting).\nWeighting parameters are based on model independence and skill over\nNorth America for seasonal temperature and annual extremes. Unless\nstated otherwise, all changes presented here represent the weighted\nmultimodel mean. The weighting scheme helps refine confidence and\nlikelihood statements, but projections of U.S. surface air temperature\nremain very similar to those in NCA3. Generally speaking, extreme\ntemperatures are projected to increase even more than average\ntemperatures.41\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States is\nprojected to rise throughout the century. Increases for the period\n2021\u20132050 relative to 1976\u20132005 are projected to be about 2.5\u00b0F\n(1.4\u00b0C) for a lower scenario (RCP4.5) and 2.9\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0C) for the\nhigher scenario (RCP8.5); the similarity in warming reflects the\nsimilarity in greenhouse gas concentrations during this period\n(Figure 4.1). Notably, a 2.5\u00b0F (1.4\u00b0C) increase makes the near-term\naverage comparable to the hottest year in the historical record\n(2012). In other words, recent record-breaking years may be \u201ccommon\u201d\nin the next few decades. By late-century (2071\u20132100), the RCPs\ndiverge significantly, leading to different rates of warming:\napproximately 5.0\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 8.7\u00b0F (4.8\u00b0C) for RCP8.5.\nLikewise, there are different ranges of warming for each scenario:\n2.8\u00b0\u20137.3\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0\u20134.1\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 5.8\u00b0\u201311.9\u00b0F (3.2\u00b0\u20136.6\u00b0C) for\nRCP8.5. (The range is defined here as the difference between the\naverage increase in the three coolest models and the average increase\nin the three warmest models.) For both RCPs, slightly greater\nincreases are projected in summer than winter (except for Alaska),\nand average maximums will rise slightly faster than average minimums\n(except in the Southeast and Southern Great Plains).\nFigure 6.7\nProjected changes in annual average temperatures (\u00b0F). Changes are\nthe difference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065; top)\nor late-century (2070-2099, bottom) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005). Each map depicts the weighted multimodel mean. Increases\nare statistically significant in all areas (that is, more than 50%\nof the models show a statistically significant change, and more\nthan 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nStatistically significant warming is projected for all parts of the\nUnited States throughout the century (Figure 6.7). Consistent with\npolar amplification, warming rates (and spatial gradients) are\ngreater at higher latitudes. For example, warming is largest in\nAlaska (more than 12.0\u00b0F [6.7\u00b0C] in the northern half of the state\nby late-century under RCP8.5), driven in part by a decrease in snow\ncover and thus surface albedo. Similarly, northern regions of the\ncontiguous United States have slightly more warming than other\nregions (roughly 9.0\u00b0F [5.5\u00b0C] in the Northeast, Midwest, and\nNorthern Great Plains by late-century under RCP8.5; Table 6.4). The\nSoutheast has slightly less warming because of latent heat release\nfrom increases in evapotranspiration (as is already evident in the\nobserved record). Warming is smallest in Hawai\u2018i and the Caribbean\n(roughly 4.0\u00b0\u20136.0\u00b0F [2.2\u00b0\u20133.3\u00b0C] by late century under RCP8.5)\ndue to the moderating effects of surrounding oceans. From a\nsub-regional perspective, less warming is projected along the coasts\nof the contiguous United States, again due to maritime influences,\nalthough increases are still substantial. Warming at higher elevations\nmay be underestimated because the resolution of the CMIP5 models\ndoes not capture orography in detail.\nRCP4.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP8.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP4.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\nRCP8.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\n6.3.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.8\nProjected changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures\n(\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States.

By mid-century, the upper bound for projected changes\n(i.e., the average of the three warmest models) is about 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C)\ngreater than the weighted multimodel mean. On a regional basis,\nannual extremes (Table 6.5) are consistently projected to rise\nfaster than annual averages (Table 6.4). Future changes in \u201cvery\nrare\u201d extremes are also striking; by late century, current 1-in-20\nyear maximums are projected to occur every year, while current\n1-in-20 year minimums are not expected to occur at all.44\nThe frequency and intensity of cold waves is projected to decrease\nwhile the frequency and intensity of heat waves is projected to\nincrease throughout the century.

By mid-century, decreases in\nthe frequency of cold waves are similar across RCPs whereas increases\nin the frequency of heat waves are about 50% greater in the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5) than the lower scenario (RCP4.5).45\nThe intensity of cold\nwaves is projected to decrease while the intensity of heat waves\nis projected to increase, dramatically so under RCP8.5. By mid-century,\nboth extreme cold waves and extreme heat waves (5-day, 1-in-10 year\nevents) are projected to have temperature increases of at least\n11.0\u00b0F (6.1\u00b0C) nationwide, with larger increases in northern regions\n(the Northeast, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, and Northwest; Table\n6.5).\nFigure 6.9\nProjected changes in the number of days per year with a maximum\ntemperature above 90\u00b0F and a minimum temperature below 32\u00b0F in the\ncontiguous United States. Changes are the difference between the\naverage for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario (RCP8.5). Maps in the top row\ndepict the weighted multimodel mean whereas maps on the bottom row\ndepict the mean of the three warmest models (that is, the models\nwith the largest temperature increase). Maps are derived from 32\nclimate model projections that were statistically downscaled using\nthe Localized Constructed Analogs technique.51\nChanges are statistically\nsignificant in all areas (that is, more than 50% of the models show\na statistically significant change, and more than 67% agree on the\nsign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC and NOAA NCEI).\nThere are large projected changes in the number of days exceeding\nkey temperature thresholds throughout the contiguous United States.\nFor instance, there are about 20\u201330 more days per year with a maximum\nover 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century under RCP8.5, with\nincreases of 40\u201350 days in much of the Southeast (Figure 6.9). The\nupper bound for projected changes is very roughly 10 days greater\nthan the weighted multimodel mean. Consistent with widespread\nwarming, there are 20\u201330 fewer days per year with a minimum temperature\nbelow freezing in the northern and eastern parts of the nation,\nwith decreases of more than 40\u201350 days in much the West. The upper\nbound for projected changes in freezing events is very roughly 10\u201320\ndays fewer than the weighted multimodel mean in many areas.\nReferences\nModal\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n1800 G Street, NW, Suite 9100, Washington, DC 20006 USA\nTel: +1 202.223.6262 | Fax: +1 202.223.3065\nContact Us \u2022\nCredits \u2022\nPrivacy Policy \u2022\nSite Map\nSome figures and images are copyright protected.\nPermission of the copyright owner must be obtained\nbefore making use of copyrighted material."

      "Effects of Climate Change on Water Resources\nGlobal Climate Change And Precipitation\nModels of climate change (GCMs) predict U.S. annual-mean temperatures to generally rise by 2\u00b0 C to 3\u00b0 C over the next 100 years, with greater increases in northern regions (5\u00b0 C), and northern Alaska (10\u00b0 C). Numerous other climatic effects are also expected. For example, U.S. precipitation, which increased by 5 to 10% over the 20th century, is predicted to continue to increase overall. More specifically, an ensemble of GCMs predicts a 20% increase for northern North America, a 15% increase in winter precipitation for northwestern regions, and a general increase in winter precipitation for central and eastern regions. Despite predictions of increased precipitation in most regions, net decreases in water availability are expected in those areas, due to offsetting increases in evaporation. A 20% decrease in summer precipitation, for example, is projected for southwestern regions, and a general decrease in summer precipitation is projected for southern areas. Although projected regional impacts of climate change are highly variable between models, the above impacts are consistent across models. \nGlobal Climate Change And Water Resources\nAdditional effects of global climate change that have important implications for water resources include increased evaporation rates, a higher proportion of precipitation received as rain, rather than snow, earlier and shorter runoff seasons, increased water temperatures, and decreased water quality in both inland and coastal areas. The physical and economic consequences of each of these effects are discussed below. \nIncreased evaporation rates are expected to reduce water supplies in many regions. The greatest deficits are expected to occur in the summer, leading to decreased soil moisture levels and more frequent and severe agricultural drought. More frequent and severe droughts arising from climate change will have serious management implications for water resource users. Agricultural producers and urban areas are particularly vulnerable, as evidenced by recent prolonged droughts in the western and southern United States, which are estimated to have caused over $6  billion in damages to the agricultural and municipal sectors. Such droughts also impose costs in terms of wildfires, both in terms of control costs and lost timber and related resources.\nWater users will eventually adapt to more frequent and severe droughts, in part by shifting limited water supplies towards higher-value uses. Such shifts could be from low- to high-value crops, or from agricultural and industrial to environmental and municipal uses. A period of delay is likely, however, because gradual changes in the frequency and severity of drought will be difficult to distinguish from normal inter-annual variations in precipitation. Economic losses will be larger during this period of delay, as compared to a world with instantaneous adjustment, but preemptive adaptation could also be costly given the uncertainty surrounding future climate. \nRising surface temperatures are expected to increase the proportion of winter precipitation received as rain, with a declining proportion arriving in the form of snow. Snow pack levels are also expected to form later in the winter, accumulate in smaller quantities, and melt earlier in the season, leading to reduced summer flows. Such shifts in the form and timing of precipitation and runoff, specifically in snow-fed basins, are likely to cause more frequent summer droughts. Research shows that these changes are already taking place in the western United States. Changes in snow pack and runoff are of concern to water managers in a number of settings, including hydropower generation, irrigated agriculture, urban water supply, flood protection and commercial and recreational fishing. Timing of runoff will affect the value of hydropower potential in some basins if peak water run-off occurs during nonpeak electricity demand. Energy shortages and resulting energy price increases will provide incentives to expand reservoir capacities or develop alternative energy sources. \nIf the runoff season occurs primarily in winter and early spring, rather than late spring and summer, water availability for summer-irrigated crops will decline, and water shortages  will occur earlier in the growing season, particularly in watersheds that lack large reservoirs. Agricultural producers, in response to reduced water supplies and crop yields, will adjust their crop mix. Producers in irrigated regions might reduce total planted acreage, or deficit-irrigate more acres, to concentrate limited water supplies on their most valuable crops (e.g. onions and potatoes, rather than wheat and alfalfa). Producers in rain-fed regions might shift to crop species and varieties with shorter growing season requirements or greater drought tolerance, such as winter grains. \nCropping practices are likely to shift as well, perhaps towards reduced- or no-till technologies, which enhance water infiltration and conserve soil moisture, or towards irrigation technologies that are more efficient at the farm level (although not necessarily at the basin level). Producers may begin to supplement dwindling surface water supplies with groundwater resources, a response that has already been observed in many drought-stricken areas. These adjustments will mitigate a portion of private economic losses. They will also affect environmental quality, although the expected direction is more difficult to predict. \nA shift in stream hydrographs to more winter flow may also disrupt the life cycle of cold water fish species, such as salmon, which depend on late spring flows to \u0093flush\u0094 young salmon to the ocean, and on summer flows to moderate water temperatures. Unless winter runoff is captured and stored for late spring or summer use, fewer salmon smolt will survive migration and more frequent fish kills will occur from lethal stream water temperatures. Such environmental impacts will intensify debates about consumptive versus instream water uses, such as those ongoing in the Klamath and Platte River Basins. \nClimate change is expected to affect water quality in both inland and coastal areas. Specifically, precipitation is expected to occur more frequently via high-intensity rainfall events, causing increased runoff and erosion. More sediments and chemical runoff will therefore be transported into streams and groundwater systems, impairing water quality. Water quality may be further impaired if decreases in water supply cause nutrients and contaminants to become more concentrated.  Rising air and water temperatures will also impact water quality by increasing primary production, organic matter decomposition, and nutrient cycling rates in lakes and streams, resulting in lower dissolved oxygen levels.  Lakes and wetlands associated with return flows from irrigated agriculture are of particular concern. This suite of water quality effects will increase the number of water bodies in violation of today\u0092s water quality standards, worsen the quality of water bodies that are currently in violation, and ultimately increase the cost of meeting current water quality goals for both consumptive and environmental purposes.  \nRising sea levels could also reduce water quality and availability in coastal areas. Recent projections of sea-level rise by the end of the 21st century range from 19 to 58 cm. A more dramatic increase in sea-level, on the order of meters rather than centimeters, is possible, but most scientists consider it a low probability risk. For example, complete melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet or West Antarctic Ice Sheet would trigger such a large rise. Rising sea levels could affect groundwater quality directly via saltwater intrusion. Radical changes to the freshwater hydrology of coastal areas, caused by saltwater intrusion, would threaten many coastal regions\u0092 freshwater supplies. \nRising sea levels could also affect water availability in coastal areas indirectly by causing water tables in groundwater aquifers to rise, which could increase surface runoff at the expense of aquifer recharge. Water shortages will cause the price of water to rise, through monthly water bills or one-time connection fees for new homes and businesses. A sufficiently large price increase could affect the extent and pattern of urban growth throughout the United States. Costly water supply projects, such as desalination plants, pipelines, and dams will also become more economically attractive. \nOne final and important effect of the water resource impacts discussed above is the potential for more frequent and intense interstate and international water allocation conflicts. Water markets have the potential to prevent or diffuse such conflicts; however, the assignment of water rights to establish the market can create more conflict than it diffuses.\nCoping With Changing Water Resources\nAlthough subject to uncertainty, forecasts of climatic change offer a glimpse into possible future water resource impacts and challenges. Predicted impacts vary by region, but include increased temperatures and evaporation rates; higher proportions of winter precipitation arriving as rain, not snow; earlier and more severe summer drought, and decreased water quality. Water shortages, which currently result in substantial economics losses, will be more common in many regions because of these impacts. Such economic losses, which occur across a range of sectors, from agriculture to energy and recreation, have profound effects on local communities. More frequent shortages imply increased costs to society, although adaptation by water users will mitigate some portion of these costs. \nWater resource users can reduce the negative effects of water shortages through a number of strategies. These include revising water storage and release programs for reservoirs, adopting crops and cropping practices that are robust over a wider spectrum of water availability, expanding and adjusting crop insurance programs (such as the Multi-Peril Crop Insurance program\u0092s Prevented Planting Provision), adjusting water prices to encourage conservation and the expansion of water supply infrastructure, and supporting water transfer opportunities. Damage from drought-induced wildfires can be minimized by using long range soil moisture forecasts to pre-position fire suppression resources and in the longer term, by changing land-use regulations to restrict development in areas facing increased fire risk.\nThe ability to anticipate and efficiently prepare for future water resource management challenges is currently limited, in part, by imprecise regional climate change models and long-term weather forecasts. Uncertainty about future climate conditions makes it more difficult to optimally prepare for and adapt to associated changes in water resource availability and quality. Imagine, for example, trying to prepare optimally for a water shortage when you are uncertain of when it will occur, how severe it will be, or how long it will persist. It may be tempting to make management plans based on the worst-case scenario; however, the opportunity cost of this \u0093safety-first\u0094 approach can be high if the worst-case does not occur. Imperfect information ultimately increases the magnitude of economic losses (or reduce the magnitude of any potential economic gains) attributable to water resource changes. \nImprovements in climate projections and long-term weather forecasts, such as forecasts based on the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO), offer potential for reducing economic losses (or increasing economic gains) associated with climate change. More specifically, improvements in the ability to detect water shortages farther in advance, to more precisely forecast their location, intensity, and duration, and to use such forecasts to inform management strategies would enhance water users\u0092 confidence in regional forecasts, and their ability to efficiently prepare for and adapt to future water resource management challenges.\nFor More Information\nAdams, R.M  and D.

      "China's Respiratory Illness Concerns Explained\nA rise in respiratory illnesses in China, particularly among children, has made headlines over the past few weeks, with global health authorities trying to estimate the scale and severity of illness.\nOn November 13, 2023, China's National Health Commission reported an increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases in China, stressing the need for enhanced disease surveillance in healthcare and community settings, and strengthened health system capacity.\nWith some hospitals reporting large numbers of cases, and other nations making preparations should illnesses spread, Newsweek has summarized the story so far and what the relative risk within China and across the globe may be.\nWhat Illnesses Have Been Reported and What Are the Symptoms?\nChinese state media Global Times reported earlier this week that the country's National Health Commission said the cases were mainly influenza, alongside mycoplasma pneumonia, rhinovirus infections, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and other illnesses.\nExperts say China's stringent anti-COVID measures, which were dropped less than a year ago, left children's immune systems unprepared, resulting in the preponderance of younger patients. No major rise in deaths has been reported.\nScientists outside of China have attempted to assess the patterns of illness independently. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia, told the Science Media Centre on November 22 that the illness in children was a fever with no cough or other symptoms although, in some cases, pulmonary nodules had been seen on chest x-rays.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause,\" Hunter said.\n\"Pulmonary nodules in children are seen in pneumococcal pneumonia and cough may be absent. Influenza can catch patchy changes on chest X-ray, often due to secondary bacterial infections so [that] could also be in the frame.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause.\"\nHunter added that it did not sound like an epidemic due to a novel virus, adding that he would \"expect to see many more infections in adults\" in that case.\nNonetheless, some concerns have grown that older Chinese residents may come into contact with pathogens during family gatherings later in the year.\nThe pattern of China's outbreak suggests it began several months ago, Chinese health experts told various state media publications this week. They expect cases to peak in the next 2-3 weeks, but infections could last through next spring.\nHealth officials have urged the public to get vaccinated for relevant diseases.\nHow Many People Have Been Affected and Where?\nWhile there have been localized reports from hospitals across China, the total number of patients across the country isn't clear.\nChinese state media has reported that in Taizhou in East China's Zhejiang province, as of Friday, November 24, the positive rate of influenza virus in outpatient cases in the city had increased to 50 percent.\nThe Tianjin Children's Hospital, located in a major port city near the capital Beijing, reported on November 18 a single-day record of 13,171 young patients across its outpatient and emergency departments, according to a local newspaper. The geographical spread of cases, spanning over 400 miles from Beijing to Liaoning, suggested a wider outbreak that began in northern China.\nLast week, state-run CCTV news reported that in the capital of Beijing, hospitals had been operating at full capacity for over a month in response to this spike in infection. Beijing Children's Hospital revealed that its internal medicine department had seen more than 7,000 cases daily. Beijing Jingdu Children's Hospital highlighted a significant rise in mycoplasma pneumonia infections, placing immense pressure on medical resources, with 90 percent of the hospital's 300 beds occupied and long queues forming outside.\nOn November 21, Chinese media and ProMed, the alert system known for its role in bringing attention to the coronavirus outbreak in 2019, reported that there had been clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia among children in northern China, although it was unclear if this was related to the reported respiratory outbreaks.\nProMed first reported numerous children being admitted to hospitals with high fevers but without typical pneumonia symptoms.\nIn northern China, which appears to be experiencing the worst of the outbreak, respiratory infections have surged for five consecutive weeks, accounting for 6.2 percent of outpatient and emergency visits, at a rate 2.5 times the average of the past three years, Lo Yi-chun, the deputy director of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Sunday, citing World Health Organization (WHO) data.\nHealth authorities such as the WHO have repeatedly asked China for further epidemiological data.\nDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO's Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention, said on Thursday: \"We are following up with the situation in China and again, they have seen overall an increase in acute respiratory infections due to a number of different pathogens, including influenza, which is on the rise.\"\nShe continued, \"Mycoplasma pneumonia was on the rise for the last couple of months and now seems to be a little bit on the decline. We are following up through our clinical networks and working clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics which is a problem across the world.\"\nWhat's the Relative Risk to Other Parts of the World?\nThe Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Saturday that the island's ports and airports were all put on \"high alert.\" Notices were placed at these locations urging travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to seek medical attention if symptomatic, and disclose their travel history to healthcare providers.\nFang Chi-Tai, a professor at the Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at National Taiwan University, told Newsweek on Monday that Taiwan had heightened disease surveillance and recommends preventive measures such as mask-wearing as well as maintaining personal hygiene upon arrival in China.\nTaiwan's public health authority said individuals planning trips to China should consider receiving vaccines for COVID and influenza at the earliest opportunity.\nNearby nations such as India and Vietnam have said that while they are not seeing an uptick in cases, their health systems are preparing and have reached out to health authorities such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for advice.\nHowever, the relative risk according to experts appears to be low. Speaking to healthcare publication STAT, the WHO's Van Kerkhove reiterated the view that the spike in cases was due to an immunity gap in China, following the lifting of COVID restrictions, and was something most other countries had already dealt with.\n\"This is not an indication of a novel pathogen. This is expected,\" Kerkhove said.\n\"This is what most countries dealt with a year or two ago.\n\"We asked about comparisons prior to the pandemic. And the waves that they're seeing now, the peak is not as high as what they saw in 2018-2019.\"\nSpeaking to CNN, Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said the cases should not cause global concern.\n\"The spikes are \"not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries,\" according to WHO, she said.\n\"Importantly, no new pathogen has been detected. There has also been no unusual clinical presentation with children appearing much sicker than normal.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSeth Moulton Faces Protest in Hometown After Controversial Trans Remarks\n\nFox News Host Confronts Mike Johnson With GOP Demand for Matt Gaetz Report\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nWhat Will Trump's New Term Mean for A.I.?\nAbout the writer\n\n\n\nThe Debate\n\nTrump's War on the D.C.

      "PERSONAL STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION ON RESPIRATORY HEALTH: ADVICE FOR PROVIDERS, PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC Carlsten C, Salvi S, Wong GWK, et al. Eur Respir J 2020; 55: INTRODUCTION The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes air pollution and climate change as a global threat to human health. Figure 1 summarizes the health burden of air pollution. There is a need to empower the public with strategies to minimize the effects of air pollution on respiratory health. It is recommended that healthcare professionals (HCPs) should help vulnerable patients protect themselves from the effects of air pollution by suggesting impact-reducing strategies that are backed by scientific evidence.\nOBJECTIVE AND METHODOLOGY To provide recommendations to assist providers and public health officials when advising patients and the public regarding personal-level strategies to mitigate risk imposed by air pollution. A literature search was performed to identify peer-reviewed scientific evidence that addressed the effectiveness of personal-level interventions to reduce exposure to air pollution, as well as the role therein of Effect Modifiers such as diet and lifestyle. SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTION The key elements in mitigating air pollution exposure and protecting respiratory health are summarized in figure 2. The population at high risk which include susceptible individuals such as those with chronic pulmonary conditions, at extremes of age and pregnant women, may benefit more from the suggested mitigation strategies.\nFigure 1: Health burden of air pollution Figure 2: Key elements in mitigating exposure and protecting respiratory health Mitigation strategies for Ambient exposure Mitigation strategies for Household exposure Effect modifiers: Interventions to modify individual risk factors Face masks Active transport Low air pollution routes Vehicle settings Plan exercise Local air forecast Clean fuel and stoves Ventilate homes Air cleaners Treat & manage respiratory conditions Reduce obesity, promote physical avtivity, smoking cessation and avoidance of second-hand smoke Healthy balanced diet \u22489 million annual deaths from global air pollution >99% of deaths due to household air pollution 90% of deaths due to ambient air pollution (low and middle-income contries) 25% of premature deaths associated with air pollution are respiratory in nature EVIDENCE-BASED* RECOMMENDATIONS TO MINIMIZE PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION Mitigation strategy Recommendation and evidence Use facemasks under appropriate circumstances(Evidence grade C) Evidence that N95 facemask use has an impact on cardiopulmonary health is limited. Close fitting N-95 masks (defined as filtering >95% of 0.3 \u00b5m particles under test conditions) are recommended when exposure to ambient air pollution exceeds recommended levels.\nManufacturers\u2019 guidance on correct mask usage, maintenance and fit, including a user seal check should be strictly followed. People with chronic respiratory, cardiac or other conditions that make breathing difficult should use an N95 facemask under strict medical supervision.\nCloth masks are far inferior to N-95 masks.\nShift from motorized to active transport (like cycling and walking) whenever possible (evidence grade C) The benefits of physical activity with active transport appears to outweigh the risks associated with the increased inhaled dose of air pollutants and a mortality benefit of physical activity even in high air pollution environments.\nInfrastructure should be designed to prioritize active transportation and make age-appropriate accommodations.\nChoose travel routes that minimize near-road air pollution exposure (evidence grade C) Provide information on how to minimize exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) by: Prioritizing low air pollution routes, integrated with cycling and walking plans, avoid major intersections, and higher-emission sides of a given road.\nMobile phone applications can help plan the travel routes.\nAn initiative funded by GSK Consumer Healthcare Summary-article-D3.indd 1 Summary-article-D3.indd 1 07-10-2020 22:30:01 07-10-2020 22:30:01 * Level-of-evidence score is based on the grading used in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) report A = Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta analyses with rich body of data, B = (RCTs) and meta analyses with limited body of data, C = Nonrandomized trials and observational studies, D= Panel consensus judgment Optimize driving style and vehicle settings (evidence grade D) Maintain optimum vehicle filtration/ventilation and, when in conditions of high air pollution, drive with windows closed and keep the air on internal circulation (reduces in-vehicle particle concentrations by up to 75%).\nModerate outdoor physical activity when and where air pollution levels are high (evidence grade C) High risk individuals (those susceptible to cardiopulmonary disease) can reduce their exposure to air pollutants by staying indoors on high pollution days and limiting outdoor physical activity near sources of air pollution. Advise to decrease or stop exercising if concerning symptoms such as coughing, chest tightness or wheezing are noticed.\nMonitor air pollution levels (evidence grade D) Conflicting data exists on efficacy of Air Quality Index alerts and wearable technology in increasing air pollution-protective behavior.\nPatients, especially those with underlying susceptibility, should be aware of air quality alerts and learn to implement appropriate protective behavior on high air pollution days.\nMitigation strategy Recommendation and evidence EVIDENCE-BASED* RECOMMENDATIONS TO MINIMIZE PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION Use clean fuels (evidence grade C), optimize household ventilation (evidence grade C) and adopt efficient cookstoves where possible (evidence grade D) Replacing biomass fuels with cleaner cooking fuels (LPG or electricity) combined with improved kitchen ventilation reduces the risk of acute respiratory infection, reduces respiratory symptoms and shortens the hospital stays versus persistent solid fuel users.\nImproved ventilation in cooking areas with cross-ventilation (opening windows or doors), chimneys or exhaust fans significantly improves respiratory health.\nUse portable air cleaners as an indoor environmental intervention (evidence grade C) Portable air cleaners in homes improve outcomes and HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters also improve symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis.\nAir-cleaning technologies that may emit harmful byproducts should be avoided and air cleaners should be placed where the most vulnerable occupants spend most of their time.\nMitigation strategy Recommendation and evidence EFFECT MODIFIER\u2019S: INTERVENTIONS TO MODIFY INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS TO PROTECT RESPIRATORY HEALTH Treat and manage respiratory conditions (evidence grade D) Maximize control of airway disease through optimized care (e.g. symptom and airflow monitoring, medications, and vaccinations).\nPromote primary, secondary and tertiary interventions to attenuate the burden of cardiopulmonary disease associated with air pollution exposure. Includes reducing obesity, promoting physical activity, smoking cessation and avoidance of second-hand smoke.\nModify diet and supplement with antioxidants or anti-inflammatory agents (evidence grade D) A healthy, balanced diet (rich in antioxidants, fiber, protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids) is associated with reductions in the risk of chronic lung diseases known to be compounded by air pollution.\nDo not recommend taking any dietary supplements as none has been shown convincingly to have such benefits.\nStrategy Recommendation and evidence SUMMARY The negative impact of air pollution on respiratory health is well documented.\nMitigation strategies (as tabulated in the article) need to be tailored to the individual dependent on their levels of air pollution exposure, susceptibilities to air pollution exposure, health literacy, financial resources and support networks.\nEvidence-based, practical recommendations should serve as a useful reference for advising patients and the public on individual-level interventions to reduce exposure to air pollution and mitigate the associated respiratory health risks.\nPM-GL-NOBRA-20-00004 Access the full article for more information on https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/55/6/1902056.\nSummary-article-D3.indd 2 Summary-article-D3.indd 2 07-10-2020 22:30:02 07-10-2020 22:30:02",
      "Lung Health and Your Environment The health of our lungs depends on a healthy environment. Research supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) shows that protecting lung health requires strategies to improve our environment and lifestyle choices.\nMany environmental factors can affect the health of your lungs. Air pollution and cigarette smoke are the greatest threats. Some lung diseases are caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. Air Quality Studies linking air quality to health effects are numerous and important. Pollution can be found outdoors, from vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, or wildfires, but also indoors. Outdoor pollution can enter a building. At home, indoor pollutants can come from gas stoves, tobacco smoke, or fireplaces. Air pollution comes in many forms and can be present anywhere. Airborne pollutants are substances, such as chemicals in smoke or exhaust, that can reduce air quality and harm health. These pollutants can contribute to lung diseases such as asthma,1 emphysema,2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer.3 Improving air quality may lead to health benefits. Large studies show an association between decreases in levels of outdoor air pollutants and improvement in lung function, including reductions in asthma symptoms.4 Former smokers with COPD who used portable air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in their homes had improved respiratory symptoms.5 Interventions that improve indoor air quality may be a way to improve respiratory health.\nClimate Change Changes in temperature and precipitation may increase health risks related to air quality, such as respiratory and cardiopulmonary illnesses. Also, the frequency and severity of allergic illnesses, including asthma and hay fever, are expected to increase as a result of a changing climate.6 More intense wildfires, hurricanes, and floods can lead to increased hospitalization and death due to cardiopulmonary disease.7 Tobacco Smoke Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, which is the leading type of cancer-related death worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Research shows that smoking just a few cigarettes a day causes long-term lung damage.8 Breathing secondhand smoke also increases a person\u2019s chance of developing respiratory disease.9 Electronic Cigarettes Using electronic cigarettes, also called vaping, can lead to lung injury, according to the American Thoracic Society. Aerosols from these devices are complex and contain many different ingredients in varying amounts. NIEHS-funded researchers found exposure to electronic cigarette aerosols with nicotine could lead to increased cell death in the lungs and weaken disease-fighting white cells that are essential for healthy lungs.10 Wildfires Exposure to wildfire smoke can increase the risk of respiratory diseases and result in a significant decrease in lung function that can persist up to two years.11 More frequent and severe wildfires due to climate change may increase rates of respiratory illness from exposure to smoke.6 Mold Most types of molds are harmless, but some produce compounds that trigger allergies or asthma attacks. Studies show that mold exposure can worsen asthma symptoms, especially in young children.12 PO Box 12233 \u2022 Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 Phone: 919-541-3345 \u2022 https://niehs.nih.gov April 2022 National Institutes of Health U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Printed on recycled paper National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Radon Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that is colorless and odorless. In the U.S., radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Outdoors, radon disperses quickly, reducing the chance for it to harm health.\nRadon can seep indoors and accumulate inside buildings and homes. Testing is the only way to know whether indoor radon levels are high. If levels are high, a qualified professional can install special vents to make a home safer. Types of Respiratory Disease Airway diseases that affect breathing involve reduced or blocked air flow. Asthma is an example. COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is often caused by smoking and indoor or outdoor air pollution. People can have a mix of asthma and COPD.\nInterstitial lung diseases reduce the lungs\u2019 ability to hold air. For example, pulmonary fibrosis is a scarring of lung tissue.\nLung cancer, an abnormal growth of cells, usually starts in the lungs, but can start elsewhere and spread to the lungs. It can have environmental and genetic causes.\nLung infections are caused by microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, viruses, or fungi) that damage lung tissue. Pneumonia is an infection that causes air sacs to fill with fluid. Pollution can increase the chance that lungs are more susceptible to infections, such as COVID-19.\nOther NIEHS Research \u2022\tMore than 50 genetic changes that affect the risk of pulmonary disorders have been identified. One change occurs in lung cells from drinking water contaminated with hexavalent chromium, an industrial chemical and human carcinogen.13 This information could improve drug development to treat lung function problems.14 \u2022\tThe NIEHS Matrix Biology Group has found a potential therapy in hyaluronan, a substance secreted by living tissue that acts as a biological scaffold for cells. It improved lung function in patients suffering from severe COPD.15 \u2022\tNon-small-cell lung cancer is often resistant to chemotherapy; however, NIEHS found silencing a gene called INO80 led to reduced tumor growth, potentially leading to better treatments and improved patient outcomes.16 \u2022\tMany tumors in the 10-20% of lung cancer sufferers who have never smoked arise from the accumulation of mutations caused by natural processes in the body.17 This finding may help researchers identify risk factors for lung cancers.

      "ElectricityPlans\nCompare Electricity Rates and Shop For Electricity Plans\nTexas Electric Rates \u2013 Market Trends and Price Forecast 2024\nTexas electricity rate trends for 2024 show prices similar to 2023. Here\u2019s our Texas electricity rates trend forecast, key factors driving electricity prices and what types of electricity plans will be popular this year. \nKey Takeaways:\nJump right to the cheapest electricity plans in Texas or read on for our trends and price forecast.\nWill electricity prices in Texas go down anytime soon? Don\u2019t bet on it.\nTexas Electricity Rates in 2024 \u2013 Average Price\nFactors That Drive Texas Electricity Rates\nThere are a number of key factors that drive Texas electricity prices. Our assessment is based on 20+ years of experience in the electricity market plus input from industry professionals.\nOne big item that affects the price you pay? When you shop. Certain seasons \u2014 Spring and Fall \u2014 are the best time to shop for electricity in Texas. And we expect August 2024 electricity rates to be some of the highest historically seen.\nAnother issue that increases your bill? Letting your contract expire and roll to a variable rate. Sign up for our free electricity contract reminder service and never forget again! \nShop Texas Residential Electricity Rates by Zip Code\nTexas Electricity Plan Trends for 2024\nChanges in the marketplace are having an effect on the products being offered. Here\u2019s what we expect to see in 2024 for Texas\u2019 popular electricity plans.\nShort Term vs. Long Term Power Contacts in 2024\nFollowing trends that we\u2019ve seen for the past 2 years, long term contracts will provide the best value in Texas electricity rates in 2024.\nThat\u2019s not to say there won\u2019t be opportunities where short term contracts offer a great rate. In fact, if you see an odd-term contract (like 8, 11, 14 months etc), take a good look. Odd-term contracts are created to take advantage of market prices. \nBut right now, wholesale electricity prices for 2024 electricity are trading at a premium. Wholesale contracts for 2025 and 2026 power are less expensive. That means you\u2019ll likely get a better rate with a 24 or 36 month plan vs. a 12 month plan. \nShop Texas Electricity Rates by Zip Code\nTexas Electricity Trends FAQs\nTexas electricity prices for 2024 will continue at levels seen in 2023. Residential electricity rates will average 14-18\u00a2 per kWh including delivery costs in 2024.\nThe Texas long-term electricity price forecast for 2025 looks positive based on ERCOT reserve margins. However, that can change based on regulatory concerns, market jitters and weather. Residential customers can protect their electricity rate for 2025 by securing a 2 or 3 year electricity contract now.\nElectricity prices in Texas have increased 20% over the last 5 years, according to data from the EIA. Higher prices are driven by increasing population, regulatory changes, weather conditions and aging infrastructure.\nThe best time to shop for electricity rates in Texas is spring and fall. Rates are historically at their lowest in April, May and October. And rates are typically highest in July, August, January and February.\nERCOT forecasts a 2024 peak demand of 86,130MW. As a comparison, ERCOT hit a record peak demand of 85,508MW on August 10, 2023. Peak demand is the highest amount of electricity used in a given time period. ERCOT stands for Electric Reliability Council of Texas, and they are a non-profit organization that manages the state\u2019s electrical grid.\nAs more large-scale solar generation assets come online, you can expect more of our 2024 power to come from renewable resources. One industry source projects that 38% of Texas power will come from wind and solar in 2024.  As a comparison, in 2023 31% of all electricity in Texas was generated from renewable energy. \nTags: 2024, electricity price forecast, electricity rates, electricity trends, energy trends, ERCOT, price forecast, rate forecast, regulatory changes, Texas, texas electricity market, texas market structure\nRebecca Bridges has worked in deregulated energy markets since 2001.

It identifies and explores the biggest trends in energy demand and supply, as well as what they mean for energy security, emissions and economic development.\nThis year\u2019s Outlook comes against a backdrop of escalating risks in the Middle East and heightened geopolitical tensions globally, and explores a range of energy security issues that decision makers face as they proceed with clean energy transitions. With rising investment of clean technologies and rapid growth in electricity demand, the WEO 2024 examines how far the world has come on its journey towards a safer and more sustainable energy system, and what more needs to be done to reach its climate goals.\nReflecting today\u2019s uncertainties, our three main scenarios are complemented with sensitivity cases for renewables, electric mobility, liquefied natural gas and how heatwaves, efficiency policies and the rise of artificial intelligence might affect the outlook for electricity.\nEnglish \nLanguage\n\nEnglish\nPolski\n\nPublished October 2024\nLicence CC BY 4.0 (report); CC BY NC SA 4.0 (Annex A)\nPress release\nLaunch live stream\nShare Cite\nOnline table of contents\n\n###### 1.0 Executive Summary Read online\n###### 2.0 Overview and key findings Read online\n###### 3.0 Context and scenario design Read online\n###### 4.0 Pathways for the energy mix Read online\n###### 5.0 Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook Read online\n###### 6.0 Security, affordability and sustainability Read online\n###### 7.0 Regional insights Read online\n###### 8.0 Regional dashboards Read online\n\nGlobal Energy and Climate Model\nThe Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model key input dataset includes selected key input data for all three modelled scenarios (STEPS, APS, NZE).

It identifies and explores the biggest trends in energy demand and supply, as well as what they mean for energy security, emissions and economic development.\nThis year\u2019s Outlook comes against a backdrop of escalating risks in the Middle East and heightened geopolitical tensions globally, and explores a range of energy security issues that decision makers face as they proceed with clean energy transitions. With rising investment of clean technologies and rapid growth in electricity demand, the WEO 2024 examines how far the world has come on its journey towards a safer and more sustainable energy system, and what more needs to be done to reach its climate goals.\nReflecting today\u2019s uncertainties, our three main scenarios are complemented with sensitivity cases for renewables, electric mobility, liquefied natural gas and how heatwaves, efficiency policies and the rise of artificial intelligence might affect the outlook for electricity.\nEnglish \nLanguage\n\nEnglish\nPolski\n\nPublished October 2024\nLicence CC BY 4.0 (report); CC BY NC SA 4.0 (Annex A)\nPress release\nLaunch live stream\nShare Cite\nOnline table of contents\n\n###### 1.0 Executive Summary Read online\n###### 2.0 Overview and key findings Read online\n###### 3.0 Context and scenario design Read online\n###### 4.0 Pathways for the energy mix Read online\n###### 5.0 Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook Read online\n###### 6.0 Security, affordability and sustainability Read online\n###### 7.0 Regional insights Read online\n###### 8.0 Regional dashboards Read online\n\nGlobal Energy and Climate Model\nThe Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model key input dataset includes selected key input data for all three modelled scenarios (STEPS, APS, NZE).

consumption! From 2001 to 2020, Texans have been burning through kilowatt-hours like theyre going out of style. With an average monthly electricity usage that could power a small city, its no wonder Texas is known for doing everything big \u2013 including its Kwh consumption. Lets take a closer look at how the Lone Star States energy habits have been lighting up the charts over the years.\nCommercial Electricity Usage\nInterpretation\nIt seems like Texas commercial establishments have been on a bit of a rollercoaster ride with their electricity consumption over the years. From the impressive 92,869 kWh per year back in 2014 to the relatively modest 6,817 kWh per month in 2003, it's clear that the Lone Star state knows how to keep things interesting when it comes to energy usage. Whether they're turning up the AC in the scorching Texas heat or keeping the lights on late into the night, one thing's for sure: Everything is bigger in Texas, including their electricity bills!\nResidential Electricity Usage\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in Texas, the only thing consuming more energy than the residents is the record of their electricity usage statistics! With a rollercoaster of numbers over the years, it's clear that Texans have a knack for keeping the lights on. Whether it's BBQ grills sizzling or AC units chilling, the Lone Star State sure knows how to power up. Maybe it's time to consider 'Switch Off Saturdays' or 'Watt Watching Wednesdays' to keep those numbers in check, but hey, at least they're consistent in one thing - consistently electrifying!\nTexas Electricity Consumption\nInterpretation\nIn a state where everything is bigger, it seems even our energy consumption doesn't hold back. With an average electricity usage of 12,216 kWh per capita in 2006, Texans prove that when it comes to power consumption, we don't just talk the talk, we kilowatt the kilowatt. So, if you ever thought everything was grand in Texas, just take a look at our electric bills for a shocking reality check.\nReferences\neia.gov\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget\u2014how much sunlight\u00a0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat\u2014over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\u00a0temperature readings\u00a0to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\u00a0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\u00a0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The \"coolest\" month was November, which was 1.35 \u02daF (0.75 \u02daC) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)\u2013the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86\u00b0C (1.55\u00b0F) above the 20th century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F). This value is 0.13\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02\u00b0C (0.04\u00b0F) higher than the last year's (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014\u20132022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's\u00a02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\u00a0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\u00a00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\u00a0Celsius)\u00a0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 \u00b0F (0.18 \u00b0C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities\u2014burning fossil fuels and clearing forests\u2014add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (\"representative concentration pathways,\" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns. (right)\u00a0 Projected temperature increase relative to the 1901-1960 average depending on which RCP we eventually follow. Image by Katharine Hayhoe, from the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nAccording to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,\u00a0 models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.\nReferences\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2023).

      "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of March 2024 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $16.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 593 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $11.1 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $995 million has been announced for clean water and water infrastructure. Florida received $2.1 billion to connect everyone in the state to reliable high-speed internet and, as of today, more than 1,708,000 Florida households are already saving on their monthly internet bill due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve the lives of Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $8.5 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $7.7 billion in highway formula funding and $158 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges to date. o $117.1 million through the RAISE program to date. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $207 million through the INFRA program to date. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet over 272,962 homes and small businesses in Florida do not have access to high-speed internet infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to everyone in America. The Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to extend this program through 2024. Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will lose their internet connection and the economic opportunities that come with it. See ACP enrollment for every state and territory here. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received $2.1 billion for high-speed internet. Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide access to high-speed internet to everyone in Florida. Florida also received $2.8 million in funding to expand middle-mile infrastructure in the state. In addition, about 1,708,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in water infrastructure in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $995 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $995 million available to date to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $229.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation and 19% of transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $1.3 billion to improve public transportation options across the state. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Announced funding to date will double the number of clean transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Schools in Florida have been awarded $45 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. Communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $113.7 million has been announced in Florida to date to build out a network of EV chargers in the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy about $150 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $392.4 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power. This includes: o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; o $162.8 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received approximately $1 billion for airports. Ports and Waterways: Our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received roughly $128.3 million for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $24.9 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience, including $51.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $123 million has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites. Approximately $25 million has been allocated to Florida for capping orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands.

Florida Project Spotlights INFRA Award Spotlight I-4 Truck Parking Facilities The Florida Department of Transportation has received $180 million to add approximately 917 truck parking spaces across four sites along I-4 in District Five in Central Florida, which includes locations in Volusia County, Seminole County and Osceola Counties. This project addresses the shortage of overnight parking for commercial vehicles in this region, which also reduces safety issues such as fatigue and unauthorized parking. The project will also incorporate electric charging stations. See here for a full list of INFRA awards. Resilience Project Spotlight Everglades Restoration The Army Corps of Engineers awarded nearly $1.1 billion to the Everglades for ecosystem restoration activities. Years of human development have isolated portions of the Everglades and altered natural flow patterns for freshwater. These projects will help regulate the inflows and outflows of water that are the lifeline of this ecosystem, helping restore the rich biodiversity of the Everglades\u2019 two million acres of wetlands. Thriving wetlands will also filter out pollution to improve water quality for the one-third of Floridians who rely on the Everglades for drinking water, and will help improve resilience to flooding that impacts the state. This historic funding marks the single largest investment in Everglades\u2019 history. See here for the full list of U.S. Army Corps projects announced in 2022. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 Grid Innovation Spotlight Improving Reliability Through Grid Hardening in Florida The Department of Energy is awarding $52.9 million to the Sumter Electric Cooperative to improve reliability of its power grid. This project consists of multiple inter-related components that SECO Energy has developed in response to the need for accelerated resilience efforts. Multiple tropical storms and hurricanes have crossed directly through SECO Energy\u2019s service territory with winds and flooding causing damage and disruptions. SECO Energy\u2019s proposed project will enhance resilience by undergrounding overhead utility lines; hardening existing poles and increasing line capacity; replacing aging, inefficient equipment; and expanding load capacity with a new distribution substation. See here for a full list of Grid Resilience Innovation and Partnership (GRIP) program awardees. Rail Project Spotlight Florida Panhandle Rail Resiliency and Connectivity Project The Department of Transportation has awarded $23.1 million to the Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad, LLC for rail infrastructure and safety improvements in Florida through the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) program. This project will help improve the 100-mile-long stretch of FGA's mainline through Florida's panhandle. The improvements will expand operating capacity and ensure safety in an area that is consistently impacted by severe hurricanes. See here for a full list of CRISI awards. Middle Mile Project Spotlight WANRack Middle Mile Project The Department of Commerce awarded $2.8 million to WANRack to build 44.8 miles of open access middle mile high-speed internet infrastructure from north of Lakeland, FL going through Pasco and Zephyrhills/Dade City and then continuing north into Hernando County. The Middle Mile Grant Program plays a critical role in providing affordable, high-speed internet for unserved regions.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June\u2013August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8\u00b0F, 2.5\u00b0F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.The January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June\u2013August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8\u00b0F, 2.5\u00b0F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.The January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\u00a0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\u00a0\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

      "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of July 2023 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $10.5 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 359 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $6.9 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $800 million has been announced for clean water. As of today, more than 1,389,000 households across the state are receiving affordable high-speed internet due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve lives for Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $5.4 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $5.1 billion in highway formula funding and $105.3 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges in 2022 and 2023. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $117.1 million through the RAISE program and $27 million through the INFRA program in 2022 and 2023. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet nearly 22% of Floridians do not have an internet subscription. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to every American. Additionally, experts estimate that as many as 3,283,000 households in Florida are eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which cuts internet bills by up to $30 per month, or $75 for households on Tribal lands, and provides a one-time $100 discount off a connected device. The Biden-Harris Administration is providing further cost savings by working with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. \u25cf Progress to date: To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. In addition, about 1,389,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, with more signing up every day. Households can check their eligibility, sign up, and find fully covered internet plans at GetInternet.gov. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $800 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $800 million available in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $146.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 more likely to commute via public transportation and 20% transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has been allocated $529.4 million to improve public transportation options across the state in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This year alone, funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help double the number of clean public transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, schools in Florida have been awarded $11.8 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. In addition, communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $71.5 million in 2022 and 2023 to build out a network of EV chargers across the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy more than $70 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $168.5 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power in 2022 and 2023. This includes: Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; and o $31.5 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Additional grid funding will be made available in the coming months. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received approximately $658.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for airports. Ports and Waterways: Like airports, our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received roughly $143.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $43.2 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $1.4 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience in 2022 and 2023 including $32.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $120.4 million has been allocated to cleaning up brownfield sites in Florida.

Florida Project Spotlights Low- and No-Emission Project Spotlight City Of Tallahassee The Department of Transportation awarded $20.3 million to the City of Tallahassee's StarMetro system to buy battery-electric buses and support charging infrastructure. This funding will also develop a workforce training program for the city's mechanics and operators to maintain the fleet. The project will help reduce emissions and improve service and reliability for riders in and around Tallahassee. See here for a full list of FY23 Bus and Low- and No-Emission Grant projects. Middle Mile Project Spotlight WANRack-mm-FL2 The Department of Commerce awarded $2.8 million to WANRack to build 44.8 miles of open access middle mile infrastructure from north of Lakeland, FL going through Pasco and Zephyrhills/Dade City and then continuing north on Route 98 into Hernando County. The Middle Mile Grant Program plays a critical role in providing quality, affordable high-speed Internet and connecting unserved regions to the Internet backbone. See here for more information about Enabling Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure Program award recipients. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Brownfields Cleanup Project Spotlight South Florida Regional Planning Council The Environmental Protection Agency awarded the South Florida Regional Planning Council $1 million to accelerate cleanup efforts at contaminated sites in Central Miami. Until 1985, Central Miami was physically separated from the predominantly white area east of 12th Avenue by an 8-foot-high concrete wall, and was nearly destroyed by a fire after riots broke out in 1979. Priority sites in Central Miami include the 2-acre former Orkin Site, the 20-acre Poinciana Industrial Center assemblage property, and the 4.3-acre Northside Transit-Oriented Development property. See here for a full list of Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) recipients. PHMSA Project Spotlight City of Milton Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization Grant The Department of Transportation awarded $10 million to the City of Milton to replace 4.38 miles of cast iron natural gas lines and 7.91 miles of steel gas mains. The project will help improve public safety, protect public health, and reduce methane emissions from natural gas distribution pipes in underserved communities. See here for more information on Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) projects. Roads and Bridges Project Spotlight I-4 West Central Florida Truck Parking Facility The $15 million grant from the Department of Transportation will help build a new truck parking facility with about 120 spaces, electric charging stations, and pedestrian infrastructure to access nearby amenities. This corridor between Tampa and Orlando carries an average of 18,000 trucks daily, but currently lacks sufficient parking. The facility will be connected to Florida\u2019s Department of Transportation Truck Parking Availability System in order to help drivers identify available parking locations more quickly. By providing reliable parking capacity, the project improves safety for tired drivers and makes supply chain movement more efficient. See here for more information on awarded grants through the INFRA program. Superfund Cleanup Project Spotlight Southern Solvents, Inc. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 The Environmental Protection Agency has announced $5 million in funding for the cleanup at the Southern Solvents, Inc. site. The funds will be used to remove and treat tetrachloroethylene (also known as PCE or PERC) and trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination in the soil and groundwater. This funding will allow EPA to restore and protect a valuable drinking water resource in the Tampa, Florida area. The cleanup will restore the site and prevent the contaminants from migrating to other areas. See here for more information on EPA Superfund cleanup work. SMART Project Spotlight A MicroFreight Approach for Safer Streets The Department of Transportation has awarded over $1.9 million to the Miami-Dade County to introduce a platform of integrated data sensors, and digital infrastructures systems to enable and scale safe, zero-emission last-mile freight and goods deliveries in Miami-Dade County.

      "Most Viewed\nStudents block Mirpur Road demanding merit-based admissions\nBanker killed as rickshaw crushed in bus-truck collision\nRemembering a legacy of opposition, a vision of independence\nDesh TV MD arrested in Dhaka airport area\nRising Sea Levels: 9 lakh in south may be displaced by 2050\nSea level rise may displace almost nine lakh people from southern Bangladesh by 2050, because their homes and livelihood will be jeopardised.\nBy the end of the century, the situation will be even worse as between 12 percent and 18 percent of Bangladesh's coastal area is projected to be submerged by rising seas, says a report\u00a0 released yesterday by the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD).\nThis will have devastating consequences for vital food crops, and more people will be forced to leave their homes, adds the report titled Climate Change Impacts in Bangladesh.\nCurrently, the estimated annual average loss due to cyclones is $1 billion, which is 0.7 percent of the GDP.\n\"Due to our country's geographical position, we are witnessing flooding, depletion of water sources, rising sea levels, and the intrusion of salinity. Projections indicate that millions, perhaps 1/7 of the population, might face displacement as per the World Bank's estimations,\" Saber H Chowdhury, minister for environment, forest and climate change, was quoted as saying in the report.\nSea level rise is projected to lead to a 6-9 percent decline in the country's rice production. Increasingly saline waters are also projected to disrupt fisheries, which will disproportionately affect poor coastal communities, for whom fish is an important source of protein.\nSaline water can also infiltrate groundwater and surface water sources, affecting drinking water supplies and human health.\n\"Sea level around South Asia will continue to rise over the 21st century, increasing flooding in low-lying Bangladesh. This will devastate vital food crops, forcing more people to leave their homes,\" says professor AKM Saiful Islam, director of the Institute of Water and Flood Management (IWFM) of Buet and a lead author of the report.\nThe accelerating impacts of climate change in Bangladesh highlights an urgent need to scale up international action against climate change.\nBangladesh repeatedly experiences extreme climate events like heatwaves and tropical cyclones, the report adds.\nIn 2019 and 2000, the country experienced 185 extreme weather events, making it the seventh most vulnerable to climate change in the world.\nGovernment adaptation policy and local initiatives have saved many lives and, so far, averted the worst impacts of climate change, the report says.\nBangladesh is recognised as a global leader in adaptation and resilience. In 2005, Bangladesh was one of the first least developed countries to develop a national adaptation programme of action.\nBy the end of the century, even under a very low emissions scenario, Bangladesh could see a further 0.8\u00b0C of warming compared with 1981\u20132010, and heavier rainfall could increase peak river flow by 16 percent relative to 1971\u20132000.\nIn the last few decades, the number of people who have died during cyclones has fallen from six digits (300,000+ from Cyclone Bhola in 1970) to double digits (35 from Cyclone Sitrang in 2022), largely due to the success of the country's Cyclone Preparedness Programme.\nIn the last few decades, the government has invested in saline-tolerant rice varieties, floating agriculture in regions that suffer flooding, and water-saving technologies in drought-prone areas to help safeguard food security in the face of increasingly extreme weather.\nRelated News\n\nGlobal loss and damage initiative launched in Dhaka \n\nA window of opportunity to phase out fossil fuels \n\nSea-level rise in Bangladesh: Faster than global average  \n\nWhat will happen when the 'Doomsday Glacier' disintegrates? \n\nClimate loss and damage are clearly visible in southwest Bangladesh \n\u2018\u09af\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09cd\u09b2\u09ac\u09c7\u09b0 \u0995\u09a5\u09be \u09ac\u09b2\u099b\u09c7\u09a8, \u09a4\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0989\u099a\u09bf\u09ce \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09cd\u09b2\u09ac\u09c0 \u09a6\u09b2 \u09a4\u09c8\u09b0\u09bf \u0995\u09b0\u09be\u2019\n\u2018\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09bf\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u099a\u09a8 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be \u098f\u09ae\u09a8 \u0995\u09cb\u09a8\u09cb \u09b6\u0999\u09cd\u0995\u09be \u09a8\u09c7\u0987, \u0985\u09a8\u09c7\u0995 \u09ac\u09bf\u09b2\u09ae\u09cd\u09ac\u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09ac\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be\u2019\n\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09c0 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c7\u09df\u09be\u09a6 \u09b8\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09cb\u099a\u09cd\u099a \u09ea \u09ac\u099b\u09b0 \u09b9\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be \u09a4\u09be\u09b0\u0993 \u0995\u09ae: \u0986\u09b2\u099c\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u09b0\u09be\u0995\u09c7 \u09a1. \u0987\u0989\u09a8\u09c2\u09b8\n",
      "\nAccessibility links\nFrom bridges and ports to a new regional hub\nBangladesh\u2019s evolving infrastructure\nSouth Asia\u2019s \"Land of Rivers\" has long faced infrastructure challenges, but from tunnels and bridges to a new deep-sea port, engineering is transforming Bangladesh.\nKnown as the \u201cLand of Rivers\u201d, Bangladesh owes its distinctive tasselled coastline to the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the world\u2019s largest river delta. A vast network of lakes and waterways criss-crosses the country\u2019s flat, low-lying terrain, meaning that most intercity journeys require negotiating one or more rivers. Couple the riverine landscape with risks including earthquakes and climate change, and it\u2019s easy to see how infrastructure bottlenecks have long inhibited Bangladesh\u2019s development.\nBut a new wave of investment is beginning to help overcome these issues. Bangladesh\u2019s longest bridge, the record-breaking Padma Bridge, extends for more than 6km (4 miles) across the turbulent Padma River. A four-lane highway and single-track railway connect 21 districts in southwest Bangladesh with the capital Dhaka, meaning\u00a0cargos of fresh produce that would sometimes rot while\u00a0in long ferry queues can reach their destination faster.\n\nThe nation\u2019s first road tunnel, Bangabandhu Tunnel, runs for more than 3km (2 miles) under the Karnaphuli river, uniting Chattogram port with Anwara opposite, and connecting two major economic corridors \u2013 the Dhaka-Chattogram and Chattogram-Cox\u2019s Bazar highways. It will also strengthen the Asian Highway Network, a road system spanning 32 countries.\nExpanding ports, expanding exports\nPorts are essential to Bangladesh\u2019s trade, but the two riverside seaports it inherited at independence, Chattogram and Mongla, are too shallow and lack the container handling capacity to keep up with the growth of trade and the ever-increasing scale of container ships.\nAs of 2020, Bangladesh\u2019s ports handled about 6,500 billion taka ($60 billion) in exports, with ship arrivals increasing at the rate of 11% per year. A dredging programme means the Payra seaport can now handle ships with a draft of up to 10.5m (35ft), which could be as long as 225m (740ft) and as wide as 30m (100ft). That said, many container ships still have to dock in India or Sri Lanka and collect or unload goods from Bangladesh using lighter vessels. This significantly adds to the cost of doing business, as well as slowing turnaround times due to the shortage of lighters.\n\nScheduled for completion at the end of 2026, the new Matarbari deep-sea port is set to transform Bangladesh\u2019s maritime infrastructure. It will be 18m (60ft) deep, with four container berths, plus room for further expansion.\n\u201cWe expect the port will handle around 10 million tons of cargo annually in the initial phase, increasing to 40 million tons in the long term,\u201d explains project director Mohammed Zafar Alam. \u201cThis will significantly reduce transportation costs and increase trade efficiency for Bangladesh.\u201d\nAlam estimates the port could increase Bangladesh\u2019s GDP by more than 1%, alongside decreasing import costs by 15% and export costs by 10%. For larger container ships, he expects to see 35 to 62 ships visit a year, potentially increasing to as many as 250.\nDeveloping the electric vehicle sector\nElectric vehicles (EVs) face specific reputational challenges in Bangladesh. On the streets of Dhaka, home-made electric rickshaws are a danger to life and limb: bicycle frames and, perhaps most importantly, brakes are not designed to sustain the speeds batteries deliver.\nBut the nation\u2019s improved road and bridge infrastructure is setting the scene for a new wave of EVs, which are more sustainable than the fossil-fuel vehicles that contribute about 15% of Dhaka\u2019s air pollution. The country\u2019s first EV manufacturing plant is under development in Chattogram.\n\u201cWell-maintained roads and bridges reduce travel times, increase accessibility and instil confidence among consumers regarding the reliability of EVs for long-distance travel,\u201d explains Hafizur Rahman Khan, chairman of Bangladesh\u2019s Runner Automobiles Plc. \u201cThis improved infrastructure also addresses concerns regarding range anxiety, a common barrier to EV adoption, by offering a network of routes with convenient charging facilities along the way.\u201d\n\nRunner Automobiles manufactures two- and three-wheeled fossil fuel-powered vehicles but has begun distributing electric two-wheelers and has a joint venture distributing electric cars. \u201cBangladesh's expanding middle-income demographic, experiencing increased affluence, is increasingly inclined towards personal transportation solutions,\u201d Khan notes. \u201cThis growing consumer base seeks convenient and cost-effective mobility options.\u201d\nWith Bangladesh on track to graduate from the UN\u2019s Least Developed Countries list in 2026, new infrastructure is helping open up the country\u2019s domestic and international trade. With 150 bridges opened on a single day in October 2023, it\u2019s possible the \u201cLand of Rivers\u201d could one day become the \u201cLand of Bridges\u201d.\n\nRise of the Bengal Tiger\nBangladesh invites businesses to be a part of its inspiring journey towards a prosperous future. Now, it\u2019s your time to invest in the mission of Smart Bangladesh.\nExplore the BBC\n"

Here we model a range of sea-level rise scenarios to assess the responses of water tables across the diverse topography and climates of the California coast. With 1\u2009m of sea-level rise, areas flooded from below are predicted to expand ~50\u2013130\u2009m inland, and low-lying coastal communities such as those around San Francisco Bay are most at risk. Coastal topography is a controlling factor; long-term rising water tables will intercept low-elevation drainage features, allowing for groundwater discharge that damps the extent of shoaling in ~70% (68.9\u201382.2%) of California\u2019s coastal water tables. Ignoring these topography-limited responses increases flooded-area forecasts by ~20% and substantially underestimates saltwater intrusion. All scenarios estimate that areas with shallow coastal water tables will shrink as they are inundated by overland flooding or are topographically limited from rising inland.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\n\n        Access Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n      \n\n        Get Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n      \n\n$29.99 /\u00a030\u00a0days\n\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA global analysis of subsidence, relative sea-level change and coastal flood exposure\n                                        \n\n\nThe coastal transition zone is an underexplored frontier in hydrology and geoscience\n                                        \n\n\nThe projected exposure and response of a natural barrier island system to climate-driven coastal hazards\n                                        \n\nData availability\nDerived model outputs that were merged across overlapping model boundaries and compiled to county boundaries are available to download at https://doi.org/10.5066/P9H5PBXP.

In the North Sea, fish have been comprehensively monitored throughout this period and resulting data provide a unique record of changes in distribution and abundance in response to climate change2,3. We use these data to demonstrate the remarkable power of generalized additive models (GAMs), trained on data earlier in the time series, to reliably predict trends in distribution and abundance in later years. Then, challenging process-based models that predict substantial and ongoing poleward shifts of cold-water species4,5, we find that GAMs coupled with climate projections predict future distributions of demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by availability of habitat of suitable depth. This will lead to pronounced changes in community structure, species interactions and commercial fisheries, unless individual acclimation or population-level evolutionary adaptations enable fish to tolerate warmer conditions or move to previously uninhabitable locations.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nShifting fish distributions in warming sub-Arctic oceans\n                                        \n\n\nFuture trends of marine fish biomass distributions from the North Sea to the Barents Sea\n                                        \n\n\nMarine fish traits follow fast-slow continuum across oceans\n                                        \n\nReferences\nSherman, K. & Hempel, G.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

Fish species, records and length to weight conversion used in the study. All length\u2212weight (L\u2212W) relationships were taken directly from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019). Slight differences in the number of filtered (unique) hauls between spe-cies originate from small differences in the raw North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey CPUE-length-per-hour datasets pulled from the ICES/DATRAS online database (ICES 2019) for each species (mean \u00b1 SD:13 667.2 \u00b1 104.9 filtered hauls, range 13 430\u221213 760 filtered hauls) Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 dependencies in fish biomass density between sea-scapes. If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2. (a) Each of the 10 seascapes (green circles) has (b) an associated time series of fish biomass density, e.g. S1\u2212S4, of which we estimate the underlying causal dependency structure in (c) a causal association network. Common drivers and in direct ef-fects can yield spurious associations that are accounted for in our approach. The dots in panel b represent observed biomass density values, the blue line is a fitted trend with 95% confidence bounds indicated in gray shading. Figure adapted from Runge et al. (2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. In (a) grey gurnard and (b) Atlantic herring, a few time-lagged exchanges occur from southern to northern seascapes, whereas in (c) drago -net, exchanges went from northern to southern and eastern to western seascapes. Other details as in Fig. 3 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed rounding areas following accumulation of biomass in the driving seascape. The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

Smallegange2, Anieke van Leeuwen1 1NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Department of Coastal Systems, and Utrecht University, 1797 SZ Texel, The Netherlands 2Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, 1012 WX Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABSTRACT: Distinct areas of seabed, called seascapes, are known to shape benthic habitats and communities, yet little is known about the extent to which they affect the dynamics of marine fish populations. We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

Fish species, records and length to weight conversion used in the study. All length\u2212weight (L\u2212W) relationships were taken directly from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019). Slight differences in the number of filtered (unique) hauls between spe-cies originate from small differences in the raw North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey CPUE-length-per-hour datasets pulled from the ICES/DATRAS online database (ICES 2019) for each species (mean \u00b1 SD:13 667.2 \u00b1 104.9 filtered hauls, range 13 430\u221213 760 filtered hauls) Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 dependencies in fish biomass density between sea-scapes. If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2.

Common drivers and in direct ef-fects can yield spurious associations that are accounted for in our approach. The dots in panel b represent observed biomass density values, the blue line is a fitted trend with 95% confidence bounds indicated in gray shading. Figure adapted from Runge et al. (2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. In (a) grey gurnard and (b) Atlantic herring, a few time-lagged exchanges occur from southern to northern seascapes, whereas in (c) drago -net, exchanges went from northern to southern and eastern to western seascapes. Other details as in Fig. 3 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed rounding areas following accumulation of biomass in the driving seascape. The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

What is budget trend analysis and why is it important?\nbudget trend analysis is a method of examining the past and future performance of a budget by comparing actual results with planned or projected ones. It can help identify the causes and effects of changes in the budget over time, as well as the opportunities and challenges for improvement. Budget trend analysis is important for several reasons, such as:\n1. It can help monitor and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of budget allocation and spending. By analyzing the trends of revenues and expenditures, one can assess whether the budget is aligned with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization or project, and whether the resources are used optimally and appropriately.\n2. It can help forecast and plan for future budget needs and adjustments. By analyzing the trends of external and internal factors that affect the budget, such as inflation, market demand, customer behavior, competitor actions, regulatory changes, etc., one can anticipate the potential impacts and risks on the budget, and prepare contingency plans or corrective actions accordingly.\n3. It can help communicate and justify the budget decisions and results to stakeholders. By analyzing the trends of key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmarks, such as return on investment (ROI), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), variance analysis, etc., one can demonstrate the value and impact of the budget, and explain the reasons and rationale behind the budget choices and outcomes.\nFor example, suppose a company wants to analyze its budget trend for the past three years and project its budget for the next year. It can use the following steps:\n- Collect and organize the historical and projected data of the budget, such as revenues, expenses, profits, etc., for each year, quarter, month, or other period of interest.\n- Calculate and compare the percentage changes, growth rates, averages, ratios, and other metrics of the budget data, and identify the patterns and variations of the budget over time.\n- analyze the causes and effects of the budget changes, and evaluate the performance and progress of the budget against the planned or expected targets and standards.\n- identify the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and challenges and solutions of the budget, and formulate recommendations and action plans for improvement.\n- Present and report the budget trend analysis results and findings, using charts, graphs, tables, and other visual aids, and highlight the key insights and implications for the budget decision-making and management.\n2. How to collect and prepare historical and projected data for budget trend analysis?\nOne of the most important steps in budget trend analysis is to collect and prepare the data that will be used to identify and explain the budget patterns and changes over time. The data sources and methods for this task may vary depending on the scope, purpose, and context of the analysis. However, some general principles and best practices can be followed to ensure the quality and reliability of the data. In this section, we will discuss how to select, obtain, and process historical and projected data for budget trend analysis. We will also provide some examples of data sources and methods that can be used for different types of budget analysis.\nThe following are some of the main aspects to consider when collecting and preparing data for budget trend analysis:\n1. Data selection: The first step is to determine what kind of data is needed for the analysis. This depends on the level of detail, the time period, and the budget categories that are of interest. For example, if the analysis aims to compare the budget allocations of different departments or programs, then the data should include the breakdown of the budget by these categories. If the analysis focuses on the changes in the budget over time, then the data should cover a sufficiently long time period to capture the trends and fluctuations. Some possible data sources for budget data are:\n- Official budget documents: These are the official records of the budget approved by the government or the legislature. They usually provide the most comprehensive and authoritative information on the budget, but they may not be easily accessible or updated.\n- Budget databases: These are online platforms that store and display budget data in a user-friendly format. They may offer more flexibility and functionality than budget documents, such as allowing users to download, filter, and visualize the data. However, they may not have the same level of detail or accuracy as budget documents.\n- Budget reports: These are publications that analyze and summarize the budget data and provide additional information and insights. They may be produced by the government, civil society organizations, or research institutions. They can be useful for understanding the context and rationale behind the budget decisions, but they may not have the same level of objectivity or completeness as budget documents or databases.\n2. Data acquisition: The next step is to obtain the data from the selected sources. This may involve different methods depending on the availability and format of the data. For example, if the data is available online, then it can be downloaded or scraped from the website. If the data is in a PDF or an image file, then it may need to be converted or extracted using optical character recognition (OCR) or other tools. If the data is not available online, then it may need to be requested from the data provider or obtained from other sources. Some possible methods for data acquisition are:\n- Downloading: This is the simplest and fastest method for obtaining data that is available online in a downloadable format, such as Excel, CSV, or JSON. It involves saving the data file to the local computer or a cloud storage service.\n- Scraping: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but not in a downloadable format, such as HTML, XML, or JavaScript. It involves writing a script or using a tool that can extract the data from the web page and save it in a structured format.\n- Converting: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but in a non-machine-readable format, such as PDF or image. It involves using a tool that can convert the data into a machine-readable format, such as Excel, CSV, or JSON.\n- Extracting: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but in a partially machine-readable format, such as PDF or image with tables or charts. It involves using a tool that can extract the data from the tables or charts and save it in a structured format.\n- Requesting: This is a method for obtaining data that is not available online or in a machine-readable format, such as paper documents or proprietary formats. It involves contacting the data provider and requesting the data in a suitable format.\n- Obtaining: This is a method for obtaining data that is not available from the original source or in a suitable format, such as unofficial or alternative sources. It involves finding and accessing the data from other sources, such as third-party websites, media reports, or personal contacts.\n3. Data processing: The final step is to prepare the data for the analysis. This may involve different tasks depending on the quality and consistency of the data. For example, if the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated, then it may need to be verified, corrected, or updated. If the data is inconsistent, incompatible, or incomparable, then it may need to be harmonized, standardized, or normalized. If the data is too complex, large, or noisy, then it may need to be simplified, aggregated, or filtered. Some possible tasks for data processing are:\n- Verifying: This is a task for ensuring the validity and reliability of the data. It involves checking the data for errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies, and comparing the data with other sources or references.\n- Correcting: This is a task for improving the accuracy and completeness of the data. It involves fixing the errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies in the data, and filling the gaps or missing values in the data.\n- Updating: This is a task for enhancing the timeliness and relevance of the data. It involves adding the latest or most recent data to the existing data, and removing the outdated or obsolete data from the existing data.\n- Harmonizing: This is a task for ensuring the compatibility and comparability of the data. It involves aligning the data with a common definition, classification, or format, and resolving the differences or discrepancies in the data.\n- Standardizing: This is a task for ensuring the consistency and uniformity of the data. It involves applying a common rule, method, or procedure to the data, and converting the data into a common unit, scale, or measure.\n- Normalizing: This is a task for ensuring the fairness and equity of the data. It involves adjusting the data for the effects of external factors, such as inflation, population, or geography, and expressing the data in relative terms, such as percentages, ratios, or indexes.\n- Simplifying: This is a task for reducing the complexity and size of the data. It involves summarizing the data with descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, range, or standard deviation, and grouping the data into categories, clusters, or segments.\n- Aggregating: This is a task for increasing the level of detail and granularity of the data. It involves combining the data from multiple sources, dimensions, or variables, and calculating the total, average, or other aggregate functions for the data.\n- Filtering: This is a task for removing the noise and irrelevance from the data. It involves selecting the data that meets certain criteria, conditions, or thresholds, and excluding the data that does not meet them.\nBy following these steps, the data can be collected and prepared for budget trend analysis. The data sources and methods may vary depending on the specific needs and objectives of the analysis, but the general principles and best practices can be applied to any type of budget data. The quality and reliability of the data can have a significant impact on the results and conclusions of the analysis, so it is important to ensure that the data is valid, accurate, complete, consistent, compatible, comparable, fair, and relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to collect and prepare historical and projected data for budget trend analysis - Budget trend analysis: How to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes\n3. How to define and measure the key aspects of your budget performance and goals?\nBudget performance\nPerformance Against Goals\nOne of the most important steps in budget trend analysis is to identify the budget categories and indicators that will help you track and evaluate your budget performance and goals. Budget categories are the broad groups of expenses or revenues that you want to analyze, such as personnel, supplies, utilities, sales, grants, etc. Budget indicators are the specific metrics or ratios that you want to measure, such as spending per employee, revenue growth rate, profit margin, etc. By defining and measuring these key aspects of your budget, you can gain insights into your budget patterns and changes over time, and compare them with your targets or benchmarks. In this section, we will discuss how to choose the appropriate budget categories and indicators for your budget trend analysis, and how to use them effectively. Here are some tips and examples to guide you:\n1. Choose budget categories that are relevant and meaningful for your organization or project. Depending on the size, scope, and nature of your budget, you may have different levels of budget categories, such as major, minor, or sub-categories. For example, a large corporation may have major categories such as operating expenses, capital expenditures, and income taxes, and minor categories such as marketing, research and development, and interest payments. A small nonprofit organization may have major categories such as program expenses, administrative expenses, and fundraising expenses, and minor categories such as salaries, travel, and rent. You should choose budget categories that reflect the main sources and uses of your funds, and that align with your strategic goals and objectives.\n2. Choose budget indicators that are relevant and measurable for your budget categories. Budget indicators are the numerical values that you use to assess your budget performance and goals. They can be absolute numbers, such as total revenue or total expenses, or relative numbers, such as percentages, ratios, or averages. You should choose budget indicators that are meaningful and informative for your budget categories, and that can be easily calculated and compared over time. For example, if you want to analyze your personnel expenses, you may use indicators such as headcount, payroll, benefits, turnover rate, or productivity. If you want to analyze your sales revenue, you may use indicators such as sales volume, sales price, market share, or customer satisfaction.\n3. Use a combination of budget indicators to get a comprehensive and balanced view of your budget performance and goals. Budget indicators can be classified into different types, such as input, output, outcome, efficiency, or effectiveness indicators. Input indicators measure the resources or inputs that you use for your budget, such as money, time, or staff. Output indicators measure the products or services that you produce or deliver with your budget, such as units, customers, or events. Outcome indicators measure the results or impacts that you achieve or influence with your budget, such as quality, satisfaction, or change. Efficiency indicators measure how well you use your inputs to produce outputs, such as cost per unit, time per customer, or staff per event. Effectiveness indicators measure how well you achieve your outcomes with your outputs, such as quality per unit, satisfaction per customer, or change per event. You should use a mix of these types of indicators to capture the different dimensions of your budget performance and goals, and to avoid focusing on only one aspect. For example, if you want to analyze your program expenses, you may use input indicators such as budget allocation, output indicators such as number of beneficiaries, outcome indicators such as impact evaluation, efficiency indicators such as cost per beneficiary, and effectiveness indicators such as impact per beneficiary.\n4. How to use projected data to create and compare different budget scenarios and outcomes?\nscenario analysis is a powerful tool that allows organizations to assess the potential impact of different budget scenarios and make informed decisions. By utilizing historical and projected data, businesses can gain valuable insights into their budget patterns and changes. In this section, we will explore the process of conducting scenario analysis and its significance in budget trend analysis.\n1. Understanding Scenario Analysis:\nScenario analysis involves creating multiple hypothetical scenarios based on different assumptions and variables. These scenarios help organizations evaluate the potential outcomes and risks associated with each scenario. By considering various factors such as market conditions, economic trends, and internal factors, businesses can gain a comprehensive understanding of their budget's performance.\n2. Creating Budget Scenarios:\nTo begin the scenario analysis, organizations need to identify the key variables that impact their budget. These variables can include factors like revenue growth, cost fluctuations, market demand, and regulatory changes. By adjusting these variables within different scenarios, businesses can simulate various budget scenarios and assess their potential impact.\n3. Comparing Budget Scenarios:\nOnce the budget scenarios are created, organizations can compare them to understand the differences in outcomes. This comparison helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each scenario and enables decision-makers to make informed choices. By analyzing the variations in revenue, expenses, profitability, and cash flow, businesses can evaluate the financial implications of each scenario.\n4. Assessing Risks and Opportunities:\nScenario analysis also allows organizations to assess the risks and opportunities associated with each budget scenario. By considering different market conditions and external factors, businesses can identify potential risks that may impact their budget performance. Additionally, scenario analysis helps in identifying opportunities for growth and optimization within the budget.\n5. Using Examples to Highlight Ideas:\nTo provide a better understanding, let's consider an example. Imagine a retail company planning its budget for the upcoming year. They create two scenarios: Scenario A assumes a moderate increase in sales due to market growth, while Scenario B considers a decline in sales due to increased competition. By comparing these scenarios, the company can assess the potential impact on revenue, expenses, and profitability. This analysis helps them make strategic decisions to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.\nScenario analysis using projected data is a valuable technique for budget trend analysis. By creating and comparing different budget scenarios, organizations can gain insights into their budget patterns, assess risks and opportunities, and make informed decisions. It empowers businesses to adapt to changing market conditions and optimize their financial performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use projected data to create and compare different budget scenarios and outcomes - Budget trend analysis: How to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes\n5. How to summarize your main findings and insights from your budget trend analysis?\nIn this blog, we have discussed how to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes. We have seen how to collect, organize, and visualize your budget data using various tools and techniques. We have also learned how to identify and explain the trends, patterns, and outliers in your budget data, and how to use them to make informed decisions and projections. In this final section, we will summarize our main findings and insights from our budget trend analysis, and provide some tips and best practices for conducting your own budget trend analysis.\nHere are some of the key points to remember when summarizing your budget trend analysis:\n- Use a clear and concise summary statement. A summary statement is a sentence or two that captures the main message or takeaway of your budget trend analysis. It should answer the question: What did you learn from your budget trend analysis? For example, you could say: \"Our budget trend analysis revealed that our income has increased steadily over the past five years, while our expenses have fluctuated significantly due to seasonal and unexpected factors. We also found that our savings rate has improved over time, but we still need to work on reducing our debt and increasing our emergency fund.\"\n- Highlight the most important and relevant findings and insights. After stating your summary statement, you should elaborate on the most important and relevant findings and insights that support your summary statement. You should focus on the findings and insights that are most relevant to your budget goals, objectives, and questions. You should also explain how your findings and insights can help you improve your budget performance and planning. For example, you could say: \"Some of the key findings and insights from our budget trend analysis are:\n1. Our income has increased steadily over the past five years, mainly due to our career advancement and salary raises. This shows that we have been successful in growing our income and achieving our career goals. However, we also noticed that our income growth rate has slowed down in the last year, which could indicate a potential plateau or decline in our income in the future. Therefore, we should consider diversifying our income sources and exploring new opportunities for income growth.\n2. Our expenses have fluctuated significantly over the past five years, due to seasonal and unexpected factors. We observed that our expenses tend to spike in the months of December and January, due to the holiday season and the winter heating costs. We also noticed that our expenses have increased in the last two years, due to some major life events, such as buying a new car, renovating our house, and having a baby. These factors have impacted our budget balance and our ability to save and invest. Therefore, we should review our spending habits and prioritize our needs and wants. We should also create a realistic and flexible budget that can accommodate our changing needs and circumstances.\n3. Our savings rate has improved over time, but we still need to work on reducing our debt and increasing our emergency fund. We found that our savings rate has increased from 10% to 15% of our income over the past five years, which is above the average savings rate of 8.8% in the US. This shows that we have been disciplined and consistent in saving and investing our money. However, we also found that our debt-to-income ratio has increased from 25% to 35% over the same period, which is above the recommended ratio of 20% or less. This means that we are spending more than we can afford on debt payments, which can affect our credit score and our financial security. Therefore, we should pay off our high-interest debt as soon as possible and avoid taking on new debt. We should also increase our emergency fund to cover at least six months of our living expenses, in case of any unforeseen events or emergencies.\"\n- Use visual aids to support your summary. Visual aids, such as charts, graphs, tables, and diagrams, can help you present your budget data and findings in a clear and engaging way. They can also help you highlight the trends, patterns, and outliers in your budget data, and compare and contrast your budget performance and projections. You should use visual aids that are appropriate for your budget data and analysis, and that can convey your message effectively. For example, you could use a line chart to show the changes in your income and expenses over time, a pie chart to show the distribution of your expenses by category, or a bar chart to show the comparison of your budget performance and projections by month or year. You should also label your visual aids properly and provide a brief explanation or interpretation of what they show. For example, you could say: \"The following line chart shows the changes in our income and expenses over the past five years. As you can see, our income has increased steadily, while our expenses have fluctuated significantly. The gap between our income and expenses represents our budget surplus or deficit, which indicates our budget balance and our ability to save and invest.\"\n```markdown\n![Line chart of income and expenses over time](line_chart.\n6. How to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis?\nData and Information\nOne of the most important aspects of writing a budget trend analysis is to properly cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your analysis. This not only shows respect for the original authors and their work, but also enhances the credibility and reliability of your analysis. Moreover, citing and acknowledging sources helps you avoid plagiarism, which is a serious academic and professional offense. In this section, we will discuss how to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis, following some general guidelines and best practices. We will also provide some examples of common citation styles and formats that you can use in your analysis.\nHere are some steps that you can follow to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis:\n1. Identify the type and format of the source. Different types of sources, such as books, journals, websites, reports, etc., may have different citation requirements and formats. For example, a book citation usually includes the author's name, the title of the book, the publisher, the year of publication, and the page number. A website citation usually includes the author's name, the title of the web page, the URL, and the date of access. You should also consider the format of the source, such as print, online, PDF, etc., as this may affect the citation style and format as well.\n2. Choose a citation style and format that suits your purpose and audience. There are many citation styles and formats that you can use in your budget trend analysis, such as APA, MLA, Chicago, Harvard, etc. Each citation style and format has its own rules and conventions for citing and acknowledging sources. You should choose a citation style and format that suits your purpose and audience, and that is consistent with the standards and expectations of your field or discipline. For example, if you are writing a budget trend analysis for a business or management course, you may want to use the APA style, which is commonly used in social sciences. If you are writing a budget trend analysis for a history or humanities course, you may want to use the Chicago style, which is commonly used in history and humanities. You should also check with your instructor, supervisor, or publisher for any specific citation requirements or preferences that they may have.\n3. Follow the citation rules and conventions of your chosen citation style and format. Once you have chosen a citation style and format, you should follow the citation rules and conventions of that style and format throughout your budget trend analysis. You should pay attention to the details and nuances of the citation style and format, such as punctuation, capitalization, indentation, spacing, etc. You should also make sure that your citations are accurate, complete, and consistent. You should avoid mixing different citation styles and formats, as this may confuse your readers and undermine your credibility. You should also avoid using outdated or unreliable sources, as this may compromise the quality and validity of your analysis.\n4. Provide a list of references or a bibliography at the end of your budget trend analysis. In addition to citing and acknowledging the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis within the text, you should also provide a list of references or a bibliography at the end of your budget trend analysis. A list of references or a bibliography is a comprehensive and alphabetical list of all the sources that you have cited and acknowledged in your analysis. It provides the full details and information of each source, such as the author's name, the title of the source, the publisher, the year of publication, the URL, etc. A list of references or a bibliography helps your readers to locate and access the sources that you have used in your analysis, and to verify and evaluate the information and data that you have presented. You should follow the same citation style and format that you have used in your analysis for your list of references or a bibliography, and make sure that it is consistent and error-free.\nHere are some examples of common citation styles and formats that you can use in your budget trend analysis:\n- APA style: This is a citation style and format that is commonly used in social sciences, such as psychology, education, business, etc. It uses the author-date system for in-text citations, and provides a list of references at the end of the analysis. For example:\nIn-text citation: (Smith, 2020, p. 15)\nReference list entry: Smith, J. (2020). Budget trends and patterns in the retail industry. ABC Publishing.\n- MLA style: This is a citation style and format that is commonly used in humanities, such as literature, language, art, etc. It uses the author-page system for in-text citations, and provides a works cited list at the end of the analysis. For example:\nIn-text citation: (Smith 15)\nWorks cited list entry: Smith, John. Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry. ABC Publishing, 2020.\n- Chicago style: This is a citation style and format that is commonly used in history and humanities. It uses the notes-bibliography system or the author-date system for in-text citations, and provides a bibliography or a list of references at the end of the analysis. For example:\nNotes-bibliography system:\nIn-text citation: 1. John Smith, Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry (ABC Publishing, 2020), 15.\nBibliography entry: Smith, John. Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry. ABC Publishing, 2020.\nAuthor-date system:\nIn-text citation: (Smith 2020, 15)\nReference list entry: Smith, John. 2020. Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry. ABC Publishing.\nThese are some of the general guidelines and best practices for citing and acknowledging the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis. By following these steps and examples, you can ensure that your budget trend analysis is well-researched, well-written, and well-referenced. You can also avoid plagiarism, enhance your credibility, and respect the original authors and their work.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family. It\u2019s devastating to the nurses. It\u2019s devastating to the physicians. It\u2019s just not a normal thing we\u2019re used to doing. And it\u2019s so impersonal, for something that\u2019s so personal.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore that experience, he said, it wouldn\u2019t even register when he heard an ambulance siren.\u00a0\n\u201cNow when I hear an ambulance go by, I feel this heaviness in the pit of my stomach of like, \u2018Is that another coronavirus patient that\u2019s going to be going into the hospital?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m emotionally exhausted by it, even though we\u2019re just getting going.\u201d\u00a0\nCalMatters COVID-19 coverage, translation and distribution is supported by generous grants from the Penner Family Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation and the California Health Care Foundation.\nRead more from CalMatters\nText\nGet breaking news on your phone.\nDownload\nKeep up with the latest via our app.\nSubscribe\nReceive updates in your inbox.\nMaricela, Montrose\nFeatured CalMatters Member\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel BeckerWater Reporter \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Becker is a journalist reporting on California\u2019s complex water challenges and water policy issues for CalMatters.

It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family. It\u2019s devastating to the nurses. It\u2019s devastating to the physicians. It\u2019s just not a normal thing we\u2019re used to doing. And it\u2019s so impersonal, for something that\u2019s so personal.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore that experience, he said, it wouldn\u2019t even register when he heard an ambulance siren.\u00a0\n\u201cNow when I hear an ambulance go by, I feel this heaviness in the pit of my stomach of like, \u2018Is that another coronavirus patient that\u2019s going to be going into the hospital?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m emotionally exhausted by it, even though we\u2019re just getting going.\u201d\u00a0\nCalMatters COVID-19 coverage, translation and distribution is supported by generous grants from the Penner Family Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation and the California Health Care Foundation.\nRead more from CalMatters\nText\nGet breaking news on your phone.\nDownload\nKeep up with the latest via our app.\nSubscribe\nReceive updates in your inbox.\nMaricela, Montrose\nFeatured CalMatters Member\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel BeckerWater Reporter \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Becker is a journalist reporting on California\u2019s complex water challenges and water policy issues for CalMatters.

      "L.A. County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day \u2014 breaking the previous record set Sunday \u2014 and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n\u201cI do think that we\u2019re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,\u201d L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week \u2014 breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n\u201cLike a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,\u201d Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county\u2019s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 \u2014 the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state\u2019s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state\u2019s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients \u2014 by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but \u201cat a certain point, you run out of options, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d Simon said. \n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that\u2019s beyond a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we can\u2019t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.\u201d\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated \u201cthan just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,\u201d said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, \u201cthey make a downward adjustment \u2014 sort of, you get a penalty.\u201d\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: \u201cIf a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.\u201d\n\u201cThe ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,\u201d the department statement continued. \u201cIf a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.\u201d\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region\u2019s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That\u2019s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we\u2019re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,\u201d Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that\u2019s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders \u2014 which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining \u2014 are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n\u201cTo be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,\u201d San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. \u201cBut our window is narrowing and closing fast.\u201d\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n\u201cVaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA authorization will mean that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.\u201d\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that \u201cthe worst is not yet behind us.\u201d\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n \u2018A huge burden\u2019: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

PinhoStaff Writer\u00a0\nDec. 11, 2020 Updated\u00a012:53 PM PT\n\nShare\n\nShare via Close extra sharing options\n\nEmail\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nThreads\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nCopy Link URLCopied!\nPrint\n\nCoronavirus cases are surging, hospitalizations are rising and public health officials are increasingly watching an important metric: intensive care unit capacity.\nThe new stay-at-home order that hit 36 million Californians recently was triggered when several regions\u2019 ICU availability slipped under 15%.\nPublic health officials fear that as the surge continues, hospitals could be overwhelmed \u2014 including the most vulnerable patients in the hospitals\u2019 highest level care units. Staying home and preventing coronavirus infections will help hospitals manage the influx of patients. As officials wait and hope for the stay-at-home order to tame the surge, they are anxiously tracking ICU capacity.\nAdvertisement\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about ICU capacity and why it\u2019s important at this stage of the pandemic.\nFive things you need to know about COVID-19\nUPDATED\u00a0Oct. 2, 2020 | 5:15 PM\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\nA lot of them are the same as symptoms of a cold or the flu: cough, sore throat, congestion or a runny nose, fatigue, muscle or body aches, fever or chills, and shortness of breath. A person with COVID-19 may also experience diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, or a new loss of taste or smell. In cases of serious illness, it can take time for symptoms to worsen.\nHow long does it take for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed to the coronavirus?\nThe first symptoms can appear in as few as two days, but it can also take as long as two weeks, according to the CDC. An incubation period of four or five days is more typical. However, a significant proportion of people who are infected \u2014 perhaps as much as 45% \u2014 never develop any symptoms, researchers say.\nWhat should I do if I think I'm infected?\nIf you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you\u2019ve been in close contact with someone who has it, the CDC recommends that you get a coronavirus test. Until you get your test results, you should assume you are infected. That means staying at home as much as possible so that you don\u2019t risk infecting others. Of course, if you\u2019re having a medical emergency, don\u2019t be afraid to call 911.  \nSome diagnostic tests look for genetic evidence of the virus in a sample of saliva or a specimen collected from the nose or throat. Others can detect specific coronavirus molecules that prompt the immune system to produce infection-fighting antibodies.\nHow can I reduce my risk of infection?\nLimit contact with people outside of your household. When you do go out, wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth and stay at least six feet away from others whenever possible. Clean your hands frequently by using soap and water for 20 seconds or a sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are dirty. At home, clean and disinfect tables, doorknobs, faucets and other frequently touched surfaces once a day.\nHow did the pandemic start?\nScientists think it began with a close relative of the novel coronavirus that has been circulating in bats and other animals for so long that it no longer makes them sick. That virus must have gained a key mutation that allowed it to infect humans. Health officials in China reported the first cases of the respiratory illness that came to be known as COVID-19 in December 2019. The first known case in Los Angeles was in January. California has had more than 800,000 confirmed cases since.\nWhat is an ICU?\nAn ICU, or intensive care unit, is a specialized hospital department that cares for people in the most critical health situations, such as those with life-threatening injuries or severe illnesses. ICUs are equipped with specialized equipment, such as ventilators.\nMost important, ICUs are staffed with highly trained nurses and physicians who provide round-the-clock care to their patients \u2014 checking their breathing, blood pressure, fluids and other vital signs. Dr. Shruti Gohil, an infectious disease specialist at UCI Health, said there is a 1-to-1 ratio of nurses to patients in ICUs.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThat kind of minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour care requires a level of training on the nurses to ... recognize problems quickly and address them quickly and then know what needs to be done while waiting,\u201d Gohil said.\nA COVID-19 patient with severe difficulty breathing may require ventilator support in an ICU.\n\u201cWe are responding at the moment to a tsunami of COVID-19 patients in the hospital,\u201d said Carmela Coyle, president and chief executive of the California Hospital Assn. \u201cBut that does not stop the heart attacks, the strokes, the cancer patients with serious, immediate needs.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhat is ICU capacity?\nCapacity is the number of staffed beds available at a point in time.\nDetermining whether capacity has been reached is more nebulous.\nThe state determines a region\u2019s ICU capacity with a weighted formula to ensure that some ICU beds remain open for non-COVID patients. When the state says a region has reached 0%, it may actually still have some beds available. Individual counties, such as Fresno, have reported having no open ICU beds.\nCapacity also fluctuates as patients exit the ICU and others enter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always sort of this movement that\u2019s not always quite captured by the snapshots that we get,\u201d said Dr. Rais Vohra, interim health officer for Fresno County. \u201cOverall, the capacity is severely impacted.\u201d\nWhat happens when an ICU reaches 0% capacity?\nHospitals will likely place patients in open beds elsewhere in the hospital, such as emergency department rooms.\nHaving open beds in other parts of the hospital does not mean a hospital is equipped to handle more intensive care patients. Dr. Bill Stringer, chief pulmonologist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, said the \u201climiting step is not going to be space or equipment. It\u2019s going to be staff.\u201d\nBecause of their specialized training in high-intensity situations, ICU medical professionals are scarce resources.\n\nCalifornia\nHere\u2019s what the ICU ward looks like with 0% availability\nICU availability in Southern California at 0%, and the crisis is expected to get worse, officials warn.\nDec. 21, 2020\n\u201cThe problem is, we\u2019ve got a nationwide shortage of critical care nurses,\u201d Coyle said. \u201cIt is not the case where you can pull any nurse into the ICU to provide that level of care.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAnd when ICUs are stretched beyond capacity, the quality of care can decline and mortality rates can rise.\nAs ICU capacity shrinks, a hospital is likely to scale back elective procedures, freeing up staff. Some healthcare workers \u2014 such as those who work in trauma, surgery and anesthesia \u2014 are already trained for high-stress scenarios, so they would be \u201cnatural pivots\u201d to the ICU, Gohil said. A critical care professional would supervise.\n\u201cIn a poor, catastrophic state, it would be an all-hands-on-deck approach,\u201d Gohil said.\nIf a hospital\u2019s beds fill, some patients may be transferred to neighboring hospitals. But moving ICU patients is risky, Stringer said.\n\u201cJust imagine somebody who is just completely inert, that is sedated, that is being supported at least with a ventilator,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most fragile and vulnerable patient being transferred. That\u2019s a very difficult decision.\u201d\nHow do I find out the ICU capacity where I live?\nThe state keeps an updated list of ICU bed availability by county.\nHospitals report their capacities daily, and the state tallies them.\nHere are the regional numbers as of Thursday afternoon:\n\nSouthern California: 7.7%, down from 9% Wednesday\nSan Joaquin Valley: 1.9%, down from 4.2%\nGreater Sacramento: 13.3%, down from 14.3%\nBay Area: 17.8%, down from 20.9%\nNorthern California: 30.3%, an improvement from 27.1%\n\nI live in a region where ICU space is at capacity, but I have a medical emergency. What do I do?\nYou should still seek help. If you\u2019re in a serious emergency, call 911.\nAdvertisement\nOtherwise, Stringer said, call the hospital emergency departments near you to check their capacity. Then wear a mask and go.\n\u201cThe hospital, even though we have plenty of COVID patients, is still a safe place to get care,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not as safe as being on a backpacking trip in the Rockies. But if you\u2019ve got an emergency, you need to call.\u201d\nMore to Read\n\n\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new coronavirus wave is disrupting lives, even with less severe illness\nJune 1, 2022\n*    \nAnother bummer coronavirus summer for California?

Seven state hospitals were given \"D\" grades and one hospital earned an \"F\" rating. \nHospitals are ranked based on the number of infections, problems with surgeries, safety issues, staffing and measures aimed at preventing errors. \nThe \"F\" was given to South Shore Hospital in Chicago. \nThe hospital did not respond to NBC Chicago's requests, but was given low marks in some infection categories, hospital falls, error prevention strategies, and staffing and communication. \nSouth Shore CEO Leslie Rogers told the Chicago Tribune after stepping into a leadership role this summer, that the not-for-profit hospital was striving to have a \"C\" or better in the next ranking.\nLocal\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman shot and killed in northwest suburbs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's what changes are coming to Social Security in 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMeanwhile, more than half a dozen other facilities got \"D\" grades on the list. \nThat includes Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Gateway Regional Medical Center in Granite City, Javon Bae Hospital in Rockford, Roseland Community Hospital in Chicago, Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center in Mattoon, Vista Medical Center East in Waukegan and Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. \nWeiss Hospital told NBC Chicago in a statement that its low ranking was \"due to an increase in hospital acquired infections\" during earlier reporting periods. \n\"Since then, we have improved our processes and expect future scores, specifically Fall, to reflect those improvements,\" a spokesperson said. \"Patient safety is our highest priority, and our physicians and staff are fully committed to quality in our patient care activities.\" \nVista Health System said it \"improved during this rating period and continuously focuses on safety, quality, and our patients\u2019 experience\" but noted that data used in its grade \"is more than three years old in some cases and does not reflect the dedication and clinical performance of Vista\u2019s physicians, nurses, and staff.\"\n\"Several national and state agencies acknowledge Vista\u2019s commitment to quality and safety, including U.S. News and World Report, which recently recognized Vista as a high-performing hospital in stroke and COPD care for 2022-2023, and the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, which recognized Vista with a 'Get with The Guidelines Stroke Gold Plus' achievement award with Target: Type 2 Diabetes Honor Roll,\" the healthcare company said. \nAdvocate Aurora Health said it has a \"robust plan in place to drive continued improvement in both safety and health outcomes for our patients.\"\n\"We firmly believe that meaningful quality and safety data should be transparent to the public. However, accurately measuring this data can be challenging, and some organizations use limited methodologies that don\u2019t always reflect the quality of care or the varied factors that contribute to patient outcomes,\" the hospital system said in a statement.\nNBC Chicago reached out to a number of other hospitals listed in the ranking but did not receive a response. \nSome prominent Chicago-area hospitals were also among the \"C\" ratings on the list, including Northwestern Medicine's Lake Forest Hospital, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System, a number of OSF HealthCare facilities, Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and more.  \nNorthwestern Medicine said its Lake Forest Hospital \"is committed to providing high quality, safe, patient-centered care.\" \n\"Our physicians, nurses and staff are driven by their dedication and passion for delivering outstanding care while always striving to do what is better for our patients,\" the hospital said in a statement. \"We believe that quality and safety data should be meaningful, informative and transparent to the public.

      "Open Access ISSN: 2573-0347 Advanced Practices in Nursing Mini Review Volume 09:03, 2024 Abstract The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. This review explores the relationship between nurse-patient ratios and various outcomes in healthcare settings, including patient morbidity and mortality, nurse job satisfaction, and overall care quality. By synthesizing current literature, the review highlights the impact of staffing levels on patient care and nurse well-being, and discusses potential strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to enhance healthcare delivery. This involves regular assessment of healthcare outcomes, patient satisfaction, and compliance with clinical guidelines. Healthcare organizations often use quality improvement methodologies, such as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles and Six Sigma, to identify areas for improvement, implement changes, and measure the impact of those changes. These methodologies provide a structured approach to problem-solving and facilitate the systematic improvement of healthcare processes.\nKeywords: Healthcare quality \u2022 Patient safety \u2022 Nurse job satisfaction \u2022 Healthcare delivery *Address for Correspondence: Christmal Dela, Department of Health Sciences, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa; E-mail: christmal.\nchristmals23@nwu.ac.za Copyright: \u00a9 2024 Dela C.

Adequate staffing levels ensure that nurses can provide thorough and attentive care, which is essential for positive patient outcomes. Conversely, inadequate nurse-patient ratios can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality, nurse burnout, and reduced quality of care. As healthcare systems globally grapple with resource constraints and increasing patient demands, understanding the impact of nurse-patient ratios is paramount for policy-making and healthcare management. This paper reviews existing literature on nurse-patient ratios, examining their influence on healthcare quality and patient safety. The goal is to identify the key outcomes associated with varying staffing levels and propose strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to improve healthcare delivery [1].\nLiterature Review Research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between nurse-patient ratios and patient outcomes. Studies have shown that lower nurse-patient ratios are associated with decreased patient morbidity and mortality. That improved nurse staffing levels significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers, and patient falls. Nurse Job satisfaction and retention are also influenced by nurse-patient ratios. High patient loads can lead to increased stress, burnout, and job dissatisfaction among nurses. This not only affects the well-being of nurses but also impacts patient care, as high turnover rates can disrupt continuity and quality of care. Healthcare quality, as measured by patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, is closely tied to nurse staffing levels. Hospitals with adequate nurse-patient ratios tend to have higher patient satisfaction scores, as patients receive more personalized and timely care. Additionally, better-staffed units often experience fewer medical errors and higher adherence to clinical guidelines [2].\nDiscussion Optimizing nurse-patient ratios is essential for enhancing healthcare quality and patient safety. Several strategies can be employed to achieve this goal. First, implementing mandated staffing ratios, as seen in California, where legislation requires specific nurse-to-patient ratios in hospitals, can ensure a baseline standard for staffing levels. Research indicates that these regulations have led to improved patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction. Second, employing flexible staffing models that adjust to patient acuity and census can help manage workload more effectively. Utilizing data-driven tools to predict patient needs and adjust staffing accordingly ensures that resources are allocated efficiently. Third, investing in nurse workforce development is crucial. Providing ongoing education, career development opportunities, and supportive work environments can enhance nurse retention and attract new entrants to the profession. This, in turn, can help maintain adequate staffing levels [3].\nFinally, leveraging technology to support nursing practice can alleviate some of the burdens associated with high patient loads. Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telehealth, and other digital tools can streamline documentation, facilitate communication, and enhance care coordination, allowing nurses to focus more on direct patient care. Healthcare quality and safety are fundamental aspects of healthcare delivery that ensure patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Quality in healthcare refers to the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes consistent with current professional knowledge. Safety, a crucial component of quality, involves minimizing risks, errors, and harm to patients during the provision of healthcare services. Together, healthcare quality and safety form the bedrock of effective medical practice and patient care. A key element of healthcare quality is the implementation of evidence-based practices. These practices are rooted in the best available scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values. By adhering to evidence-based guidelines, healthcare providers can ensure that the treatments and interventions they offer are both effective and efficient. For instance, the use of standardized protocols for managing chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension has been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications. Similarly, adherence to surgical checklists has been proven to significantly decrease surgical errors and infections [4].\nPatient safety initiatives aim to create a safe healthcare environment by preventing and reducing risks, errors, and harm that can occur during patient care. These initiatives encompass a range of strategies, including the development of safety protocols, the use of technology to prevent errors, and the promotion of a culture of safety within healthcare organizations. For example, the implementation of Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems has been instrumental in reducing medication errors by ensuring accurate and legible prescriptions. Additionally, the use of barcoding systems Adv Practice Nurs, Volume 09:03, 2024 Page 2 of 2 Dela C.\nfor medication administration ensures that patients receive the correct medications at the appropriate dosages. A critical aspect of healthcare quality and safety is the continuous monitoring and improvement of healthcare processes [5].\nAnother vital component of healthcare quality is patient-centered care. This approach involves respecting patients' preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that they guide all clinical decisions. Patient-centered care emphasizes the importance of effective communication, shared decision-making, and providing compassionate and respectful care. By involving patients in their care, healthcare providers can improve patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment plans, and overall health outcomes. Healthcare quality and safety are also influenced by the work environment and culture within healthcare organizations. A supportive work environment that promotes teamwork, open communication, and continuous learning is essential for ensuring high-quality and safe patient care. Organizations that prioritize staff well-being, provide ongoing education and training, and encourage reporting and learning from errors is better positioned to deliver safe and effective care. Moreover, regulatory bodies and accreditation organizations play a significant role in promoting healthcare quality and safety. These entities establish standards and guidelines that healthcare organizations must adhere to and conduct regular inspections and evaluations to ensure compliance. Accreditation by organizations such as The Joint Commission signifies that a healthcare facility meets high standards of care and safety [6]. Conclusion The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. Adequate staffing levels are associated with better patient outcomes, higher nurse job satisfaction, and overall improved healthcare delivery. By implementing mandated staffing ratios, employing flexible staffing models, investing in workforce development, and leveraging technology, healthcare organizations can optimize nurse-patient ratios to enhance patient care and nurse well-being. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, prioritizing adequate nurse staffing will remain essential for ensuring high-quality, safe, and effective patient care.\nAcknowledgement None.\nConflict of Interest None.\nHow to cite this article: Dela, Christmal. \u201cThe Impact of Nurse-patient Ratios on Healthcare Quality and Safety.\u201d Adv Practice Nurs 9 (2024): 387.\nReferences 1.

      "International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products Statistics Explained Source : Statistics Explained (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statisticsexplained/) - 15/11/2024 1 Data from April 2024 Planned article update: April 2025 \" In 2023 compared with 2022, imports (+6.1%) grew but exports (-3.5%) fell, shrinking the trade surplus from C 174 billion to C 158 billion.\" \" The United States and Switzerland were the EU\u2019s main trading partners for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023. \" \" Among the EU countries, Germany was the largest exporter of medicinal and pharmaceutical products to countries outside the EU, in 2023. \" This article is part of an online publication providing recent statistics on international trade in goods, covering information on the EU\u2019s main partners, main products traded, speci\ufb01c characteristics of trade as well as background information.\nStrong growth of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 Figure 1 shows that extra-EU exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products have decreased for the \ufb01rst time since 2008, dropping C 10 billion compared to 2022, while imports continued to increase. Even the \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008, which affected trade in many other products, did not cause a fall in exports or imports. With exports increasing more than imports, the trade surplus increased from C 18 billion in 2002 to a record high of C 174 billion in 2022 but fell to C 158 billion in 2023.\nFigure 1: EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Increasing share in total trade In 2023, the share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade was 7.8% with the share for imports (4.7%) much smaller than the share for exports (10.8%). Between 2002 and 2008 these shares remained fairly stable (Figure 2). In 2009, the share of imports increased by 1.3 percentage points (pp) and exports by 1.6 pp.\nThis was not caused by an increase in trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products but rather by the decline in total trade. Since 2009, the shares have been \ufb02uctuating but there is a clear overall growth.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 2 Figure 2: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade, 2002-2023 (% in total trade) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) United States and Switzerland remain the top EU partners The United States stands out as the EU\u2019s main trading partner for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 (Figure 3). Exports to the United States (33 %) were almost a third of all EU exports and were followed at some distance by Switzerland (15 %) and China (8 %). Imports to the EU were dominated even more by the United States (39 %) and Switzerland (32 %) followed by the United Kingdom (7 %). Since the United States and Switzerland are by far the two largest trade partners, the development of their trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products with the EU is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 3 Figure 3: Main EU partners for trade of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade with the United States and Switzerland between 2002 and 2023 Figure 4 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and the United States from 2002 to 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, imports from the United States increased by 19.3% while exports decreased by 1.5%. This caused the trade balance to fall from C 54 billion in 2022 to C 45 billion in 2023.\nMeasured as average annual growth between 2002 and 2023, exports increased by 8.8 % per year and imports increased by 7.2 % per year. During the whole period the EU has had a trade surplus with the United States, peaking at C 54 billion in 2022.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 4 Figure 4: EU trade with the United States in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Figure 5 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and Switzerland from 2002 to 2023. In 2023, for the \ufb01rst time in the period under investigation, exports (C 43 billion) were larger than imports (C 38 billion), causing the trade de\ufb01cit of C 1 billion in 2022 to turn into a surplus of C 4 billion in 2023. Over the whole period between 2002 and 2023, measured as average annual growth, exports increased by 10.0 % per year, while imports increased by 7.3 % per year.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 5 Figure 5: EU trade with Switzerland in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products by EU Member State The share of intra EU imports in total (intra + extra) imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 6). For Luxembourg, Lithua-nia and Estonia it was above 93 %, while for Slovenia and Malta it was below 40 %. The average for the EU was 68 %.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 6 Figure 6: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in intra and extra EU imports, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) The share of intra EU exports in total (intra + extra) exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products also varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 7). For Luxembourg, Slovakia, Czechia and Estonia it was above 80 %, while for Portugal, Finland, Denmark and Slovenia it was below 40 %. The average for the EU was 48 %.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 7 Figure 7: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in intra and extra EU exports, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Table 1 shows that in 2023, amongst the EU countries, Germany had the highest extra-EU exports (C 62 billion) followed by Belgium (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 37 billion). Four countries had shares higher than 20 % for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU exports. These were Slovenia (59 %), Ireland (33 %), Denmark (27 %) and Belgium (25 %).\nBelgium (C 26 billion), Germany (C 20 billion) and the Netherlands (C 16 billion) were the largest importers of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from countries outside the EU, in 20231. In 2023, Slovenia (18 %), Belgium (14 %) and Austria (13 %) had the highest shares for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU imports.\nGermany (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 31 billion) had the largest extra-EU trade surpluses for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023. Only Romania, Slovakia, Malta, Estonia and Czechia had trade de\ufb01cits.\n1Dutch and Belgian imports can be overestimated due to the so-called \"Rotterdam effect\" (See sectionData sources for more details) International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 8 Table 1: Extra EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (C million and %) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Source data for tables and graphs \u2022 International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products: tables and \ufb01gures Data sources This article is based on data available in the Eurostat COMEXT database for EU EU countries and in the United Nations COMTRADE database for non-EU countries.\nA code (such as \u2019DS_018995\u2019) is inserted as part of the source. This code allows the reader to easily access the most recent EU data on the Eurostat website. Note that data on the website is frequently updated and may also be more detailed or have a different measurement unit. It should also be noted that European statistics on international trade in goods are compiled according to the EU concepts and de\ufb01nitions and may, therefore, differ from national data published by EU countries.\nProduct classi\ufb01cation Division 54 \u2019Medicinal and pharmaceutical products\u2019 of the Standard international trade classi\ufb01cation revision 4 (SITC Rev. 4), is made up of the sub-groups: \u2022 5411 \u2019Provitamins and vitamins (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5413 \u2019Antibiotics (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5414 \u2019Vegetable alkaloids (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5415 \u2019Hormones, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes\u2019; \u2022 5416 \u2019Glycosides; glands or other organs; antisera, vaccines; International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 9 \u2022 5419 \u2019Pharmaceutical goods, other than medicaments\u2019; \u2022 5421 \u2019Medicaments containing antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5422 \u2019Medicaments containing hormones, etc., but not antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5423 \u2019Medicaments containing alkaloids, but not containing hormones etc. or antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5429 \u2019Medicaments not elsewhere speci\ufb01ed\u2019.\nUnit of measure Trade values are expressed in millions (106) or billions (109) of euros. They correspond to the statistical value, i.e.\nto the amount which would be invoiced in case of sale or purchase at the national border of the reporting country. It is called a FOB value (free on board) for exports and a CIF value (cost, insurance, freight) for imports.\nA bias in the geographical allocation of extra-EU \ufb02ows Extra-EU imports and exports are reported by the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged, usually the place where the goods cross the EU external frontier (here referred to as the exit/entry Member State). This is not necessarily the Member State of actual import or export. The geographical allocation of an extra-EU \ufb02ow is biased in the case where the entry/exit Member State is not the actual importing/exporting Member State. In such a case, the extra-EU trade will be allocated to the entry/exit Member State and the actual importing/exporting Member State will report only intra-EU \ufb02ows with the exit/entry Member State. This issue particularly impacts the extra-EU imports of EU countries having important ports for transshipment of goods like Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This is why it is known as the \u2019Rotterdam effect\u2019.\nThe United Kingdom is considered as an extra-EU partner country for the EU for the whole period covered by this article. However, the United Kingdom was still part of the internal market until the end of the transitory period (31 December 2020), meaning that data on trade with the United Kingdom are still based on statistical concepts applicable to trade between the EU countries. Consequently, while imports from any other extra-EU trade partner are grouped by country of origin, the United Kingdom data re\ufb02ect the country of consignment. In practice this means that the goods imported by the EU from the United Kingdom were physically transported from the United Kingdom but part of these goods could have been of other origin than the United Kingdom. For this reason, data on trade with the United Kingdom are not fully comparable with data on trade with other extra-EU trade partners.\nContext Pharmaceutical products are among the most important products within the chemicals sector (SITC section 5).\nToday, the pharmaceutical sector is extensively regulated at EU level in the dual interest of ensuring the highest possible level of public health and patient con\ufb01dence in safe, effective and high-quality medicinal products, while continuing to develop a single EU market for pharmaceuticals in order to strengthen the European pharmaceutical industry\u2019s competitiveness and research capability.\nThe most common trade impediments faced by pharmaceutical exporters are a range of burdensome and costly registration, licensing and certi\ufb01cation procedures. The EU aims to redress these through its bilateral trade agreements or by tackling individual barriers as part of its market access partnership.\nOther articles \u2022 International trade in goods - other articles International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 10 Dedicated section International trade in goods - dedicated section Database International trade in goods - database Data visualisations \u2022 International trade in goods - visualisations Methodology International trade in goods - methodology Legislation \u2022 International trade in goods - legislation External links \u2022 European Commission - DG Trade Notes International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 11",

Collectively, that leading cohort of international buyers paid for 43.9% of globally imported drugs and medicines during 2023. That percentage indicates a relatively concentrated market of buyers worldwide.From a continental perspective, European countries were responsible for over half (53.8%) of spending on drugs and medicines imported during 2023 with pharmaceutical purchases valued at $268 billion. In second place were North American importers at 20.7% while another 17.4% of imported pharmaceuticals was delivered to customers in Asia.Smaller percentages were delivered to Latin America (3.9%) excluding Mexico but including the Caribbean, Africa (2.7%), then Oceania (1.5%) led by Australia and New Zealand.The metrics below combine subtotals for two 4-digit Harmonized Tariff System code prefixes for drugs and medicine subcategories, specifically prefixes 3003 (consisting of 2 or more constituents mixed together) and 3004 (other).Drugs and Medicines: Top 15 Importer CountriesBelow are the 15 countries that imported the highest dollar value worth of drugs and medicines during 2023.United States: US$89.8 billion (18% of imported prescription drugs and medicines)Switzerland: $40.5 billion (8.1%)Germany: $32.5 billion (6.5%)Belgium: $31.3 billion (6.3%)mainland China: $24.5 billion (4.9%)Italy: $20.6 billion (4.1%)France: $18.4 billion (3.7%)United Kingdom: $16.8 billion (3.4%)Japan: $15.9 billion (3.2%)Netherlands: $15.8 billion (3.2%)Spain: $14.9 billion (3%)Canada: $11.5 billion (2.3%)Russia: $8.7 billion (1.7%)Slovenia: $7.5 billion (1.5%)Poland: $6.9 billion (1.4%)By value, the listed 15 countries purchased 71.4% of all prescription drugs and medicines imports in 2023.Among the above countries, the fastest-growing markets for prescription drugs and medicines since 2019 were: Slovenia (up 92.6%), Switzerland (up 90.4%), Netherlands (up 55.9%) and Spain (up 38.5%).Three major markets that posted declines in their imported prescription drugs and medicines purchases were: Russia (down -16.9% from 2022), United Kingdom (down -10.6%) and Japan (down -6.4%).Drugs and Medicines: All Importer Countries in 2023By value, the 100 key countries showcased in the following automated database bought 98.5% of imported pharmaceutical drugs and medicines purchased in 2023.RankImporterDrugs & Medicines%2019-231.United States$89,784,868,000+13.3%2.Switzerland$40,508,742,000+90.4%3.Germany$32,470,160,000+4.7%4.Belgium$31,341,161,000+33%5.mainland China$24,543,916,000+14.1%6.Italy$20,578,736,000+20.4%7.France$18,352,469,000+15.5%8.United Kingdom$16,789,558,000-10.6%9.Japan$15,874,455,000-6.4%10.Netherlands$15,846,137,000+55.9%11.Spain$14,915,496,000+38.5%12.Canada$11,528,660,000+35.5%13.Russia$8,677,211,000-16.9%14.Slovenia$7,547,471,000+92.6%15.Poland$6,943,402,000+33.5%16.Australia$6,060,842,000+13.3%17.Ireland$5,971,430,000+39.2%18.Czech Republic$5,412,484,000+26.1%19.South Korea$5,334,372,000+30.1%20.Brazil$5,073,335,000+31.7%21.Austria$4,648,764,000+22.6%22.Mexico$4,533,840,000+60.3%23.Romania$4,300,172,000+40.3%24.Taiwan$4,166,141,000+35%25.Denmark$3,872,409,000+17.6%26.Saudi Arabia$3,666,414,000-11.9%27.Sweden$3,346,424,000+17.1%28.Egypt$3,275,554,000+51.4%29.Hungary$3,074,217,000+6.7%30.Greece$2,987,559,000+35.3%31.Hong Kong$2,983,988,000+34.1%32.Portugal$2,755,852,000+20.3%33.United Arab Emirates$2,429,182,000-25.6%34.T\u00fcrkiye$2,344,378,000-13.2%35.Colombia$2,301,768,000+46.5%36.Panama$2,119,079,000+26%37.Thailand$2,088,829,000+20.6%38.Slovakia$2,068,323,000+29.7%39.Singapore$1,923,068,000+20%40.Israel$1,897,285,000+9.4%41.Finland$1,870,201,000+17.1%42.Vietnam$1,819,464,000-32.6%43.Bulgaria$1,763,585,000+37.7%44.Ukraine$1,733,174,000+1%45.South Africa$1,731,505,000-3%46.Norway$1,705,741,000+10.1%47.Philippines$1,705,359,000+23.8%48.Kazakhstan$1,447,313,000+63.6%49.Chile$1,444,123,000+33.2%50.Lithuania$1,375,341,000+32.5%51.India$1,360,321,000-0.6%52.Argentina$1,266,289,000+10.1%53.Serbia$1,258,935,000+56.6%54.Malaysia$1,236,736,000-10.2%55.Croatia$1,157,943,000+30.7%56.New Zealand$1,021,456,000+58.8%57.Ecuador$1,009,529,000+40.5%58.Dominican Republic$903,093,000+50.5%59.Algeria$890,666,000-26.8%60.Indonesia$824,449,000+32.5%61.Guatemala$823,646,000+50.9%62.Latvia$793,096,000+30%63.Iraq$781,840,000-22.3%64.Uzbekistan$725,626,000-12.1%65.Costa Rica$676,671,000+16%66.Peru$670,747,000+15.8%67.Estonia$653,465,000+34.8%68.Luxembourg$627,835,000+39.8%69.Nigeria$616,888,000-31%70.Morocco$590,242,000+28.4%71.Jordan$549,354,000+23.2%72.Kuwait$524,991,000-49.5%73.Honduras$524,968,000+20.4%74.Sri Lanka$518,445,000+32.9%75.El Salvador$503,492,000+28.6%76.Tunisia$480,237,000+9.7%77.Iran$472,615,000-46.3%78.Azerbaijan$461,973,000+76.6%79.Ethiopia$460,848,000-17.4%80.Kenya$452,729,000-4.2%81.Belarus$448,584,000-24.7%82.Cyprus$431,955,000+61%83.Georgia$427,490,000+32.2%84.Nicaragua$419,879,000+30%85.Ivory Coast$403,719,000+16.7%86.Macao$378,970,000+63.3%87.Malta$371,918,000+50.8%88.Pakistan$365,901,000-22.4%89.Bosnia/Herzegovina$363,769,000+26.8%90.Myanmar$353,747,000-21.1%91.Qatar$352,935,000-23.8%92.Tanzania$328,493,000+31.2%93.Cambodia$268,915,000+39.6%94.Democratic Rep.

Collectively, that leading cohort of international buyers paid for 43.9% of globally imported drugs and medicines during 2023. That percentage indicates a relatively concentrated market of buyers worldwide.From a continental perspective, European countries were responsible for over half (53.8%) of spending on drugs and medicines imported during 2023 with pharmaceutical purchases valued at $268 billion. In second place were North American importers at 20.7% while another 17.4% of imported pharmaceuticals was delivered to customers in Asia.Smaller percentages were delivered to Latin America (3.9%) excluding Mexico but including the Caribbean, Africa (2.7%), then Oceania (1.5%) led by Australia and New Zealand.The metrics below combine subtotals for two 4-digit Harmonized Tariff System code prefixes for drugs and medicine subcategories, specifically prefixes 3003 (consisting of 2 or more constituents mixed together) and 3004 (other).Drugs and Medicines: Top 15 Importer CountriesBelow are the 15 countries that imported the highest dollar value worth of drugs and medicines during 2023.United States: US$89.8 billion (18% of imported prescription drugs and medicines)Switzerland: $40.5 billion (8.1%)Germany: $32.5 billion (6.5%)Belgium: $31.3 billion (6.3%)mainland China: $24.5 billion (4.9%)Italy: $20.6 billion (4.1%)France: $18.4 billion (3.7%)United Kingdom: $16.8 billion (3.4%)Japan: $15.9 billion (3.2%)Netherlands: $15.8 billion (3.2%)Spain: $14.9 billion (3%)Canada: $11.5 billion (2.3%)Russia: $8.7 billion (1.7%)Slovenia: $7.5 billion (1.5%)Poland: $6.9 billion (1.4%)By value, the listed 15 countries purchased 71.4% of all prescription drugs and medicines imports in 2023.Among the above countries, the fastest-growing markets for prescription drugs and medicines since 2019 were: Slovenia (up 92.6%), Switzerland (up 90.4%), Netherlands (up 55.9%) and Spain (up 38.5%).Three major markets that posted declines in their imported prescription drugs and medicines purchases were: Russia (down -16.9% from 2022), United Kingdom (down -10.6%) and Japan (down -6.4%).Drugs and Medicines: All Importer Countries in 2023By value, the 100 key countries showcased in the following automated database bought 98.5% of imported pharmaceutical drugs and medicines purchased in 2023.RankImporterDrugs & Medicines%2019-231.United States$89,784,868,000+13.3%2.Switzerland$40,508,742,000+90.4%3.Germany$32,470,160,000+4.7%4.Belgium$31,341,161,000+33%5.mainland China$24,543,916,000+14.1%6.Italy$20,578,736,000+20.4%7.France$18,352,469,000+15.5%8.United Kingdom$16,789,558,000-10.6%9.Japan$15,874,455,000-6.4%10.Netherlands$15,846,137,000+55.9%11.Spain$14,915,496,000+38.5%12.Canada$11,528,660,000+35.5%13.Russia$8,677,211,000-16.9%14.Slovenia$7,547,471,000+92.6%15.Poland$6,943,402,000+33.5%16.Australia$6,060,842,000+13.3%17.Ireland$5,971,430,000+39.2%18.Czech Republic$5,412,484,000+26.1%19.South Korea$5,334,372,000+30.1%20.Brazil$5,073,335,000+31.7%21.Austria$4,648,764,000+22.6%22.Mexico$4,533,840,000+60.3%23.Romania$4,300,172,000+40.3%24.Taiwan$4,166,141,000+35%25.Denmark$3,872,409,000+17.6%26.Saudi Arabia$3,666,414,000-11.9%27.Sweden$3,346,424,000+17.1%28.Egypt$3,275,554,000+51.4%29.Hungary$3,074,217,000+6.7%30.Greece$2,987,559,000+35.3%31.Hong Kong$2,983,988,000+34.1%32.Portugal$2,755,852,000+20.3%33.United Arab Emirates$2,429,182,000-25.6%34.T\u00fcrkiye$2,344,378,000-13.2%35.Colombia$2,301,768,000+46.5%36.Panama$2,119,079,000+26%37.Thailand$2,088,829,000+20.6%38.Slovakia$2,068,323,000+29.7%39.Singapore$1,923,068,000+20%40.Israel$1,897,285,000+9.4%41.Finland$1,870,201,000+17.1%42.Vietnam$1,819,464,000-32.6%43.Bulgaria$1,763,585,000+37.7%44.Ukraine$1,733,174,000+1%45.South Africa$1,731,505,000-3%46.Norway$1,705,741,000+10.1%47.Philippines$1,705,359,000+23.8%48.Kazakhstan$1,447,313,000+63.6%49.Chile$1,444,123,000+33.2%50.Lithuania$1,375,341,000+32.5%51.India$1,360,321,000-0.6%52.Argentina$1,266,289,000+10.1%53.Serbia$1,258,935,000+56.6%54.Malaysia$1,236,736,000-10.2%55.Croatia$1,157,943,000+30.7%56.New Zealand$1,021,456,000+58.8%57.Ecuador$1,009,529,000+40.5%58.Dominican Republic$903,093,000+50.5%59.Algeria$890,666,000-26.8%60.Indonesia$824,449,000+32.5%61.Guatemala$823,646,000+50.9%62.Latvia$793,096,000+30%63.Iraq$781,840,000-22.3%64.Uzbekistan$725,626,000-12.1%65.Costa Rica$676,671,000+16%66.Peru$670,747,000+15.8%67.Estonia$653,465,000+34.8%68.Luxembourg$627,835,000+39.8%69.Nigeria$616,888,000-31%70.Morocco$590,242,000+28.4%71.Jordan$549,354,000+23.2%72.Kuwait$524,991,000-49.5%73.Honduras$524,968,000+20.4%74.Sri Lanka$518,445,000+32.9%75.El Salvador$503,492,000+28.6%76.Tunisia$480,237,000+9.7%77.Iran$472,615,000-46.3%78.Azerbaijan$461,973,000+76.6%79.Ethiopia$460,848,000-17.4%80.Kenya$452,729,000-4.2%81.Belarus$448,584,000-24.7%82.Cyprus$431,955,000+61%83.Georgia$427,490,000+32.2%84.Nicaragua$419,879,000+30%85.Ivory Coast$403,719,000+16.7%86.Macao$378,970,000+63.3%87.Malta$371,918,000+50.8%88.Pakistan$365,901,000-22.4%89.Bosnia/Herzegovina$363,769,000+26.8%90.Myanmar$353,747,000-21.1%91.Qatar$352,935,000-23.8%92.Tanzania$328,493,000+31.2%93.Cambodia$268,915,000+39.6%94.Democratic Rep.

      "Medicare Drug Prices Are Changing: What to Know\nMedicare released its new drug prices for 2026, and many of the costliest prescriptions are set to be lowered for Americans who rely on the government health insurance.\nPresident Joe Biden has approved deals with drug companies to lower the costs of 10 of Medicare's most common and expensive drugs.\nThe Biden administration said that the new prices would save taxpayers about $6 billion, while the seniors on Medicare could save $1.5 billion on their prescriptions.\n\"For years, millions of Americans were forced to choose between paying for medications or putting food on the table, while Big Pharma blocked Medicare from being able to negotiate prices on behalf of seniors and people with disabilities. But we fought back\u2014and won,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\"Today, for the first time in history, my Administration is announcing that Medicare has reached agreements on new, lower prices with the manufacturers of all 10 drugs selected for the first round of drug price negotiation.\"\nThe affected medications include those Americans use to manage diabetes, cancer and heart disease, which affect millions each year.\nFor the 10 medications, Medicare recipients will save between 38 and 79 percent starting in 2026. The drugs include Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp.\nBlood clot medications Eliquis and Xarelto went down to $231 and $197, while diabetes medications got major savings too.\nJardiance, Januvia, Farxiga and Fiasp shaved hundreds off their list prices for 2026, now costing between $100 and $200 compared to previous costs above $500 for a 30-day supply.\nThe full list of price changes was announced on the White House website.\nAltogether, more than 67 million Americans rely on Medicare for their health coverage, but high drug prices and premiums have made health care unaffordable for many.\n\"It's a relief for the millions of seniors that take these drugs to treat everything from heart failure, blood clots, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn's disease, and more\u2014and it's a relief for American taxpayers,\" Biden said.\nMedicare previously said blood thinners Xarelto and Eliquis would see lower prices because of the new deals, alongside diabetes medications Jardiance and Januvia.\nPreviously, the U.S. government was not permitted to negotiate with Big Pharma over drug prices, though private insurers always had this ability.\n\"This meant that drug companies could basically charge whatever they want for lifesaving treatments people rely on, and all Americans paid the price,\" White House adviser Neera Tanden said in a media call on Wednesday evening.\nPharmaceutical companies have not been pleased with Biden's price negotiations and pushed against the Inflation Reduction Act, which made the negotiations law.\nWhile the first 10 selected drug prices aren't set to change until 2026, the U.S. government can pick another 15 medications to negotiate on next year.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the negotiations would save the government $25 billion in the next seven years.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also instituted a cap on out-of-pocket drug costs, which is set to start in 2025. Next year, seniors can expect to pay a maximum of $2,000 for their prescriptions.\n\"As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare Part D has become a stronger safety net for Medicare beneficiaries who need expensive medications,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for medicareresources.org, told Newsweek. \"This will provide significant financial relief to enrollees who used to spend far more than that for their medications.\"\nWith the lower costs on prescriptions, there is some concern that those costs could be passed on to Medicare premium prices. Likely in an effort to mitigate some of those issues, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is paying an extra $15 per member per month to insurers.\n\"Some Republican lawmakers are challenging the premium stabilization program, alleging that it should have required congressional approval,\" Norris said. \"But the implementation of this program should ensure that people with Medicare Part D continue to have multiple affordable options for 2025.\"\nOpen enrollment for Medicare begins October 15 and runs to December 7, with all plan selections taking effect in January.\n\"It's a big win for Medicare recipients. One of the concerns going into these negotiations was that a deal wouldn't be reached, and a few of these drugs wouldn't have the same amount of coverage many need,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\n\"Even if you don't use one of the drugs covered, it's an encouraging sign,\" he added. \"With an increasing older population in America, more taxpayers are going to join Medicare in the coming years. The government taking a more proactive approach to negotiations to cover drug prices is one current and future recipients will be thankful for.\"\nUpdate 8/15/24, 10:18 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nTop stories\n\nTrump Is Picking the 'Avenger Squad' for Cabinet, Charlie Kirk Says\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nTrump Allies React to Biden Allowing Ukraine to Hit Russia With US ATACMS\n\nTrump Picks FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr To Lead the Agency\nAbout the writer\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

      "Telemedicine Statistics \u2013 The Latest Telehealth Statistics in 2024\nIn this guide, we cover the main regional telemedicine markets, the most important telehealth use cases, and the key current and future trends in the field.\nTelemedicine statistics give us information about providing support and healthcare through electronic communication channels, like telephones and the internet. It\u2019s part of the digital transformation of healthcare and has been on the rise for the last few decades.\nIt was COVID-19, however, that really pushed telemedicine and remote clinical services into the spotlight. Around the world, medical professionals and patients relied on telehealth and virtual care to mitigate the risks of infection and optimize the resources of healthcare systems.\nAfter the pandemic, many facilities continued to offer remote healthcare services, and the market has been growing ever since.\nGiven these advancements and the considerable potential impact of telemedicine on healthcare, it\u2019s important to pay attention to telemedicine statistics and trends. Let\u2019s dive in.\nKey Telemedicine Statistics\nTelemedicine Market Size & Forecast\nAccording to Grand View Research, the telemedicine market was valued at almost $115 billion in 2023. The report forecasts it to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.96% between 2023 and 2030. Fortune Business Insights concurs with that assessment, predicting that the telemedicine market will reach $286.22 billion by 2030.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to the growth of the telemedicine market and the popularity of digital health solutions. Social distancing measures and the overwhelming impact on medical personnel meant that many routine appointments were canceled. Here\u2019s a quick overview of COVID-19\u2019s impact on telemedicine.\nTelemedicine and Covid-19\nA 2022 study by Kaiser Permanente tells us that before the start of the pandemic, telemedicine integration in the US was rudimentary, although 76% of American hospital systems did have some form of telehealth. However, in the first three months of the pandemic, telehealth insurance claims grew by 766%, and over 20% of all US medical appointments in 2020 were remote.\nMoreover, before COVID-19, 65% of American medical professionals had never used telemedicine, and 23% used it rarely.\nDuring the pandemic\u2019s peak, more than 97% of healthcare experts were using telemedicine. For 43%, half of their appointments were telehealth appointments. In terms of outlook, 44% of US doctors predict that between 10% and 49% of their future appointments will be through telehealth.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Region\nAs with most emerging technologies, regions use and develop telemedicine at different rates. In this section, we look at key telemedicine statistics in different parts of the world, including popularity and uptake, number of users, and consumer attitudes.\nNorth America\nNorth America is the largest telemedicine market in the world, with a share of 33.5%. That\u2019s hardly surprising since many telehealth companies have a presence in the region. Moreover, as of 2022, 22% of global telemedicine companies were looking to expand to Canada and 17% to the US.\nIn 2023, Canada\u2019s telehealth market revenue (including digital treatment and digital wellbeing) reached $2.42 billion,\u00a0roughly ~$100 million more than the year before. That revenue is forecast to hit $3.58 billion by 2028, as the significant growth is largely due to Canada\u2019s high telehealth literacy.\nAs of 2021, over 80% of physicians in the country had the expertise to provide virtual care, and 78% were satisfied by the level of patient support they could provide through this channel.\nIn the US, the telemedicine market was valued at $38.04 billion in 2022\u00a0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.1% until 2030. In 2023, 44% of physicians used it at least weekly\u00a0and 40% daily. For 65% of American physicians, 25% of all their appointments in 2022 were telehealth appointments.\nEurope\nThe European telemedicine market is almost on par with North America in terms of development and growth. As of 2022, 77% of European countries frequently used telemedicine, with COVID-19 contributing to its use. As our infographic shows, the Spanish telemedicine market had a significant boost during COVID-19.\nSpain is the largest telemedicine market in the EU. Almost 72% of Spanish residents had a telemedicine appointment during the pandemic. The market revenue was $270.2 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $351.5 million by 2027.\nGiven that the number of telemedicine users in the country increased from 1.18 million in 2020 to 1.32 million in 2021 and is forecast to reach 1.41 million in 2027, such exponential growth isn\u2019t surprising. The average revenue per user (ARPU) in telemedicine is also forecast to grow from $209.5 in 2022 to $250 by 2027.\nThe UK isn\u2019t far behind. For instance, over 80% of patients in the UK\u00a0 had a telephone (22%) or a video consultation (59%) with their doctor during COVID-19. And in 2022, 28% of physicians saw at least 75% of their patients via telemedicine. In comparison, this was 2% in Germany and Sweden, and 1% in France.\nIn 2022, the British telehealth market was valued at $1.58 billion and is forecast to reach $16.2 billion by 2030. The main reasons are the ongoing healthcare crisis in the UK and the government\u2019s digitization efforts.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America (LATAM), Brazil has the largest telehealth market, which is not surprising, considering it\u2019s one of the most populated countries in the world. In 2020, there were around 2.46 million users of online medical consultations.\nThe number grew to 3.49 million in 2023 and is forecast to reach 4.25 million by 2028. The ARPU has been growing steadily since 2021 and is predicted to reach $292.81 in 2028.\nOther LATAM countries have somewhat smaller telemedicine markets. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the region\u2019s 2023 telemedicine market revenue and its forecast growth.\nAsia-Pacific\nThe Asia-Pacific (APAC) telemedicine market is experiencing significant growth. Before the pandemic, the region\u2019s telemedicine adoption rate was low: 5% in Australia, 29% in India, and non-existent in Malaysia. However, in 2024, the adoption rate is predicted to grow exponentially: 70% in Malaysia, 76% in China, and 56% in Australia.\nAPAC\u2019s telemedicine market size was approximately $16.8 billion in 2020, and it\u2019s forecast to more than double by 2025 ($37.1 billion). Japan is expected to see some of the largest growth, from $5.1 billion in 2023 to $7.1 billion in 2028.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Audience\nNow, let\u2019s look at two user groups in these global telemedicine markets: the patients and the medical professionals.\nWho Uses Telemedicine?\nAccording to 2021 research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, 37% of adults used telemedicine, with slightly more females using it (42%) than males (31.7%). Regarding age, patients aged 65 and over used telemedicine the most (43.3%) and\u00a0Gen Z (18\u201325-year-olds) the least (29.4%) in 2021 .\nAn ASPE (a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services) study conducted a year later\u00a0shed more light on telemedicine users in 2022. It shows that 22.5% of adults and 18.1% of children in the US used telemedicine that year.\nLike the CDC study, the ASPE report found that Gen Z use telemedicine the least (17.6%)\u00a0and baby boomers (those aged 65+) the most (24.6%). In terms of income split, the highest percentage of telemedicine users in 2022 had an annual income of less than $25,000 (26.4%).\nBut what about other countries?\nIn Spain\u00a0more women used telemedicine (63.2%) than men (47.4%) in 2022, like the US. Again, similar to the US, Gen Z had the lowest rate of telemedicine use (49.1%). However, it was the millennials (aged 26\u201340) who used telemedicine most frequently (58%). For\u00a0baby boomers, the rate was 54.1%.\nAttitudes Towards Telemedicine\nAs with all innovations, people have varying opinions about telemedicine. In this section, we look at the statistics related to the opinions and attitudes of medical professionals and patients towards telemedicine.\nAs the above graph shows,\u00a0Australia had the highest percentage of physicians worldwide who were satisfied with telehealth in 2022. The potential for time saved using telemedicine was also highest in Australia in 2023 \u2013 up to six hours each year.\nIn fact, many physicians worldwide consider telemedicine a convenient solution. Almost 70% of American healthcare professionals perceived telemedicine as \u2018convenient\u2019 in 2021, and 35% as \u2018efficient.\u2019 Moreover, the lion\u2019s share of these physicians believe that ease of use is the key to ensuring patients\u2019 access to telemedicine.\nConvenience is also the prevalent factor among physicians in other countries. For instance, in Canada, 70% of healthcare professionals found providing video appointments very convenient, and 77% had the same opinion about telephone appointments. And 84% of physicians confirmed that telehealth made it easier for patients to access their care.\nPatients\u2019 attitudes towards telemedicine is moving in a positive direction. Before COVID-19, 66% of adults in the US had concerns about the quality of telemedicine. However, this changed after the pandemic, and as of 2021, 88% preferred to use telemedicine.\nMoreover, studies tell us that during COVID-19, patients\u2019 experiences with telehealth appointments were just as positive as or more positive than face-to-face healthcare appointments in the US.\nOf these appointments, patients tended to prefer video calls to telephone appointments. One study found that women preferred telehealth appointments for certain reproductive health issues.\nPatients in Mexico seem to concur. According to statistics from 2021, almost 80% of telemedicine users said telehealth appointments were just as good as in-person appointments. About one-third of people (27%) in Great Britain were skeptical of telemedicine before trying it.\nTop Telemedicine Use Case Statistics\nNow, let\u2019s take a closer look at why people use telemedicine. In this section, we\u2019ll delve into the most common use cases for telehealth appointments.\nDiagnostics & Follow-up Appointments\nThe most common reason people in the US used telemedicine in 2023 was follow-up appointments, which made up around 47% of all US telehealth appointments. It seems to be the convenience that people find attractive.\nIndeed, in a paper published in The American Journal of Managed Care, researchers stipulate that 52.5% of follow-up patients found telemedicine appointments more efficient.\nMental Health Support\nAnother common purpose of telehealth appointments is mental health support, used by over one-third of American telemedicine users between 2021 and 2023. These telemental health services improve access to mental healthcare for certain groups of people, but it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all solution, as it requires some technological literacy.\nChronic Conditions Support\nTelemedicine has been a game-changer for patients with chronic conditions. During COVID-19, telehealth was used by almost 50% of Europeans living with such conditions. In the US, physicians reported that 72% of their telehealth appointments were related to chronic care in 2021.\nIn addition to improving patients\u2019 quality of life, telemedicine is a significant time-saver for people with chronic illnesses. For instance, Italians with chronic pain could save up to 9.5 hours per year with telemedicine, more than in any other country. Germans and Australians with chronic conditions could save up to 7.4 hours.\nFuture Telemedicine Trends\nWhat is the future of telemedicine? Given that it\u2019s already making a huge difference to millions of people\u2019s lives, it\u2019s no surprise that the only way for telehealth is up.\nBut what are the trends shaping its development?\nIntegration With AI\nThe applications of AI in healthcare are boundless, and telemedicine is no exception. AI-powered apps can analyze huge amounts of patient data to help identify patterns and offer invaluable insights.\nChatbots and virtual assistants can enhance patient engagement by providing real-time responses to queries, helping schedule appointments, and setting reminders to take medication. Also, the diagnostics applications of AI can help save time and optimize physicians\u2019 workload.\nAugmented Reality & Virtual Reality\nTelemedicine doesn\u2019t just support patients, it can transform the day-to-day work of medical professionals. AR and VR can help professionals, especially those being trained, to engage in realistic medical simulations, such as surgeries and procedures.\nThese simulations can provide a valuable learning experience, boosting physicians\u2019 competence.\nRemote Patient Monitoring\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) is a big deal in telemedicine, especially for patients with chronic illnesses. For example, integrating RPM with wearable technologies allows healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely and access up-to-date data, enabling them to provide the best patient care. It also allows real-time responses to help prevent complications.\nClosing Thoughts\nLike any other medtech innovation, telehealth\u2019s primary goal is to help people. During COVID-19, we were shown how well telemedicine can work on an unprecedented scale, leading to accelerated digital transformation in medical technologies. As of 2023, that market was worth more than $100 billion, and it continues to grow.\nIn this guide, we reviewed the key telemedicine markets, how they are growing, how patients and medical professionals perceive telemedicine, and the most common use cases.\nWe feel optimistic about the future of telemedicine, telehealth, and other medtech advancements. However, we also know that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution, and we look forward to seeing how innovators will bridge the gap that restricts access to telemedicine and other healthcare to various population groups.\nSources\nQuestion & Answers (0)\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

      "\n    California Health Care Foundation\n  \n\n    Utility menu\n  \nThe Prognosis for Telehealth\nThe future of primary care could be a hybrid model of in-person and telehealth care, including both phone and video visits\nOne of the biggest shifts in health care that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t about vaccines or masks or monoclonal antibodies. In fact, it wasn\u2019t really about the SARS-CoV-2 virus at all. It was the dramatic growth of telehealth.\nBetween February and April 2020, telehealth visits for primary care, conducted either by phone or video, increased from zero to 148 visits per 1,000 patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in California, according to new research from the Santa Monica\u2013based RAND Corporation. In contrast, in-person care dropped from about 230 to 65 visits per 1,000 patients during that time, RAND found.\nBy the summer of 2021, the number of in-person visits at California FQHCs had rebounded to 66% of primary care appointments, but telehealth still composed about one-third of visits. Telehealth is even more prevalent in the behavioral health care realm, with 72% of appointments conducted either by phone or video as of August 2021.\n\u201cWe joke that a decade of telemedicine implementation happened in a week or two,\u201d said Lori Uscher-Pines, a RAND senior policy researcher. \u201cIt was amazing how quickly health systems and individual providers were able to start offering telehealth visits.\u201d\nThis rapid shift to telehealth is unsurprising, given the urgency of keeping patients and staff members safe during the pandemic. What remains to be seen is whether, once the dust settles and COVID-19 is deemed less of a threat, telehealth will be here to stay.\nThe findings of the RAND report suggest that while telehealth has a valuable role in increasing access to care, it should not serve as a blanket replacement for in-person visits. There were concerns over the efficacy of audio-only appointments, the difficulties in implementing video visits, and whether patients might be at risk of receiving inadequate care because of these technological challenges. As a result, a hybrid model, including in-person, video, and occasionally audio visits that caters to patients\u2019 individual needs, would likely be the best approach, the researchers said.\nOvercoming Barriers to Care\nA strong argument in favor of telehealth is that virtual visits, both audio and video, enhance equity by increasing accessibility and flexibility for patients. \u201cWe look at the many barriers that patients face in getting care \u2014 geography, transportation, childcare, getting time off work, language,\u201d said Chris Perrone, director of CHCF\u2019s Improving Access team, which funded RAND\u2019s research. \u201cTelehealth makes it easier to see or talk with a physician without having to find childcare, take a day off work, or travel long distances.\u201d\nThat expands access to care, Perrone said.\nHowever, there are questions about whether the level of care offered in telehealth visits is as effective and as high quality as in-person visits. Also, some visits must be conducted in person because of the need for a physical examination or the collection of lab samples and biometric information.\nBefore the pandemic, one of the biggest concerns about telehealth services was the rising costs of that approach to providing care. \u201cTelemedicine use was very restricted prior to the pandemic, both at the federal level and at the state level across the US,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cA big concern was that offering telehealth would increase costs without necessarily improving population health. That\u2019s because telehealth is so easy to access and it\u2019s so convenient that it would lead to extra utilization that was not necessary.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, Medicare and state Medicaid programs did not pay for telehealth visits except in specified situations. In March 2020, that policy quickly changed out of necessity. In March of this year, federal reimbursements for telehealth services were extended until at least the end of 2022 \u2014 and possibly longer \u2014 with the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In California, the Department of Health Care Services is committed to continue paying FQHCs for video and audio telehealth visits after the pandemic \u2014 covering all Medi-Cal covered benefits and services.\nPerceptions of Telehealth\nFacing this inflection point, CHCF commissioned several reports to assess the state of telehealth during the pandemic at California FQHCs, which serve people with low incomes and are primarily funded through reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.\nAn assessment (PDF)\u00a0of 23 FQHCs\u2019 implementation of telehealth during the height of COVID-19, found that 86% of providers were satisfied with the work they performed via telehealth and 84% would continue providing telehealth after the pandemic subsides.\nA second report from RAND surveyed staff and providers at 45 FQHCs, public hospitals, and community health centers across the state, which serve a combined 1.7 million patients. It found that, overall, \u201cPerceptions of whether telehealth provided an acceptable level of care were relatively positive, but perceptions of its sustainability \u2014 as well as perceptions of equity and quality of care \u2014 were nuanced.\u201d\nWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\n\u2014Lori Uscher-Pines, RAND Corporation\nTelehealth provided important access to care during the pandemic and helped patients overcome \u201cbarriers to in-person care, such as transportation,\u201d the report found. However, there were concerns about \u201cinequities in access, particularly for patients who were most affected by the digital divide.\u201d\nCHCF also funded other research that documents patient views on telehealth. A 2020 CHCF survey of people with low incomes found their telehealth visits compared favorably to in-person visits. Seventy-two percent of respondents who received care by phone were as satisfied or more satisfied. Of those who received care by video, 65% were as satisfied or more satisfied than with their last in-person visit.\nAudio-Only Versus Video Visits\nHealth care workers\u2019 biggest worry centered around phone versus video visits. Among the FQHCs that were part of RAND\u2019s recent analysis, less than 5% of telehealth visits were conducted via video, despite their advantages over audio-only visits in many cases. As a result, a major emphasis has been on how clinics can expand access to video visits for their patients.\n\u201cSurveys suggest that providers generally prefer video visits,\u201d said Uscher-Pines. \u201cThey get additional information \u2014 for example, just being able to see and visually examine the patient. Providers say they really like being able to see a patient\u2019s home environment and for the patient to open up their medicine cabinet and show what\u2019s in it.\u201d\nHowever, it\u2019s also true that many patients don\u2019t like video for this very reason \u2014 they don\u2019t want to let providers into their homes, particularly if they haven\u2019t developed a trusting relationship with the provider.\nNeighborhood Healthcare in San Diego County and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) were two FQHCs that invested in video telehealth early in the pandemic. They reported that there were considerable growing pains in getting both patients and physicians to use the technology.\nIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is.\n\u2014Amanda Churape, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital\n\u201cWhat comes with integrating a new workflow is a lot of hesitancy, so our numbers were pretty low in the beginning,\u201d said Amanda Churape, a specialty care program manager at ZSFG. \u201cA lot of our providers and staff had actually never used Zoom or had never really had experience doing video, so there was a lot of training that needed to be done.\u201d\nSignificant numbers of patients and providers did not have a Zoom-compatible device at all, she said.\n\u201cWe started pushing very early on to go to video, and that was a challenge simply because those platforms, at that time, were just poorly developed,\u201d said Jeffrey Glenn, chief operating officer at Neighborhood. \u201cOur visits are 15 minutes apiece, so the providers would tell us, \u2018I can\u2019t spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to connect the patient.\u2019 And so early on, they would give up quickly and they would say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to call you.\u2019\u201d\nRamping Up Capabilities\nTo assist with the transition to remote provider visits, CHCF \u2014 which had funded projects working to expand use of the model even before the pandemic \u2014 launched the $6 million Tipping Point for Telehealth Initiative to help FQHCs ramp up their digital capabilities. The initiative included a learning collaborative on how to provide telehealth most effectively, dubbed the Connected Care Accelerator, as well as grants to enable clinics to invest in training and equipment.\nClinics were given flexibility in how they used the money as long as they applied it to expanding their telehealth capacity. Some of the clinics used the money to hire a specialized coordinator, like Churape, who oversees a team of telehealth ambassadors who help set up patients for video visits. First, the ambassadors screen patients to see if they have a device with a camera and access to Wi-Fi or an unlimited data plan. Then the ambassadors teach the patient how to download the application, join the meeting, and troubleshoot audio and video issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is,\u201d Churape said. \u201cWhat took the most time is actually getting the patient onto the application, teaching them how to download the application, teaching them how to join a meeting.\u201d\nOther FQHCs, including Neighborhood, used the grant money to buy equipment like iPads and rolling workstations to provide virtual visits at their clinics. Medical assistants move the rolling video displays between exam rooms and queue up patient calls, allowing physicians to transition seamlessly back and forth between in-person and telehealth visits.\n\u201cA provider may be in Exam Room A seeing a patient in person, but then when they get done and walk into the next room, there may be a virtual patient sitting on the iPad,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIn the very beginning we felt like we need to have dedicated providers, like 100% telehealth or 100% in-person. Then we graduated to this hybrid model, which we are still employing today.\u201d\nLooking Ahead: A Hybrid Model of Care\nEven with all the work they\u2019ve put in, Neighborhood and ZSFG say most of their telehealth visits are still conducted via telephone. That may be because many of the populations the clinics serve face the greatest barriers to accessing care: the elderly, people experiencing homelessness, and people with limited English proficiency. Uscher-Pines worries that those patients, who are only able to obtain audio telehealth services, may be receiving lower quality care as a result.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a little bit concerning is that [these] patients are getting an untested service,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cIt may be that audio-only visits are appropriate for many different use cases, but the literature just isn\u2019t there yet to support when it\u2019s appropriate and when it\u2019s not.\u201d\nGiven the advantages and drawbacks of telehealth, audio, and video, many providers are now calling for a hybrid model of care, offering a mix of in-person and virtual appointments depending on the patient and purpose of the visit.\n\u201cTelehealth quality is really complicated. The question is not \u2018Does telehealth work?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Does telehealth work for this patient population with this condition served in this setting?\u2019\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s clear from the RAND report is that the flexibility of telehealth is valuable for many patients and providers, with one-third of visits conducted virtually over a year into the pandemic. Making sure that these appointments, whether they are conducted by phone or video, are accessible, and are of the highest quality, will be critical in ensuring equitable care for patients who face barriers to in-person visits, even after the COVID-19 public health emergency is over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDana G.

      "\n    California Health Care Foundation\n  \n\n    Utility menu\n  \nThe Prognosis for Telehealth\nThe future of primary care could be a hybrid model of in-person and telehealth care, including both phone and video visits\nOne of the biggest shifts in health care that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t about vaccines or masks or monoclonal antibodies. In fact, it wasn\u2019t really about the SARS-CoV-2 virus at all. It was the dramatic growth of telehealth.\nBetween February and April 2020, telehealth visits for primary care, conducted either by phone or video, increased from zero to 148 visits per 1,000 patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in California, according to new research from the Santa Monica\u2013based RAND Corporation. In contrast, in-person care dropped from about 230 to 65 visits per 1,000 patients during that time, RAND found.\nBy the summer of 2021, the number of in-person visits at California FQHCs had rebounded to 66% of primary care appointments, but telehealth still composed about one-third of visits. Telehealth is even more prevalent in the behavioral health care realm, with 72% of appointments conducted either by phone or video as of August 2021.\n\u201cWe joke that a decade of telemedicine implementation happened in a week or two,\u201d said Lori Uscher-Pines, a RAND senior policy researcher. \u201cIt was amazing how quickly health systems and individual providers were able to start offering telehealth visits.\u201d\nThis rapid shift to telehealth is unsurprising, given the urgency of keeping patients and staff members safe during the pandemic. What remains to be seen is whether, once the dust settles and COVID-19 is deemed less of a threat, telehealth will be here to stay.\nThe findings of the RAND report suggest that while telehealth has a valuable role in increasing access to care, it should not serve as a blanket replacement for in-person visits. There were concerns over the efficacy of audio-only appointments, the difficulties in implementing video visits, and whether patients might be at risk of receiving inadequate care because of these technological challenges. As a result, a hybrid model, including in-person, video, and occasionally audio visits that caters to patients\u2019 individual needs, would likely be the best approach, the researchers said.\nOvercoming Barriers to Care\nA strong argument in favor of telehealth is that virtual visits, both audio and video, enhance equity by increasing accessibility and flexibility for patients. \u201cWe look at the many barriers that patients face in getting care \u2014 geography, transportation, childcare, getting time off work, language,\u201d said Chris Perrone, director of CHCF\u2019s Improving Access team, which funded RAND\u2019s research. \u201cTelehealth makes it easier to see or talk with a physician without having to find childcare, take a day off work, or travel long distances.\u201d\nThat expands access to care, Perrone said.\nHowever, there are questions about whether the level of care offered in telehealth visits is as effective and as high quality as in-person visits. Also, some visits must be conducted in person because of the need for a physical examination or the collection of lab samples and biometric information.\nBefore the pandemic, one of the biggest concerns about telehealth services was the rising costs of that approach to providing care. \u201cTelemedicine use was very restricted prior to the pandemic, both at the federal level and at the state level across the US,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cA big concern was that offering telehealth would increase costs without necessarily improving population health. That\u2019s because telehealth is so easy to access and it\u2019s so convenient that it would lead to extra utilization that was not necessary.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, Medicare and state Medicaid programs did not pay for telehealth visits except in specified situations. In March 2020, that policy quickly changed out of necessity. In March of this year, federal reimbursements for telehealth services were extended until at least the end of 2022 \u2014 and possibly longer \u2014 with the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In California, the Department of Health Care Services is committed to continue paying FQHCs for video and audio telehealth visits after the pandemic \u2014 covering all Medi-Cal covered benefits and services.\nPerceptions of Telehealth\nFacing this inflection point, CHCF commissioned several reports to assess the state of telehealth during the pandemic at California FQHCs, which serve people with low incomes and are primarily funded through reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.\nAn assessment (PDF)\u00a0of 23 FQHCs\u2019 implementation of telehealth during the height of COVID-19, found that 86% of providers were satisfied with the work they performed via telehealth and 84% would continue providing telehealth after the pandemic subsides.\nA second report from RAND surveyed staff and providers at 45 FQHCs, public hospitals, and community health centers across the state, which serve a combined 1.7 million patients. It found that, overall, \u201cPerceptions of whether telehealth provided an acceptable level of care were relatively positive, but perceptions of its sustainability \u2014 as well as perceptions of equity and quality of care \u2014 were nuanced.\u201d\nWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\n\u2014Lori Uscher-Pines, RAND Corporation\nTelehealth provided important access to care during the pandemic and helped patients overcome \u201cbarriers to in-person care, such as transportation,\u201d the report found. However, there were concerns about \u201cinequities in access, particularly for patients who were most affected by the digital divide.\u201d\nCHCF also funded other research that documents patient views on telehealth. A 2020 CHCF survey of people with low incomes found their telehealth visits compared favorably to in-person visits. Seventy-two percent of respondents who received care by phone were as satisfied or more satisfied. Of those who received care by video, 65% were as satisfied or more satisfied than with their last in-person visit.\nAudio-Only Versus Video Visits\nHealth care workers\u2019 biggest worry centered around phone versus video visits. Among the FQHCs that were part of RAND\u2019s recent analysis, less than 5% of telehealth visits were conducted via video, despite their advantages over audio-only visits in many cases. As a result, a major emphasis has been on how clinics can expand access to video visits for their patients.\n\u201cSurveys suggest that providers generally prefer video visits,\u201d said Uscher-Pines. \u201cThey get additional information \u2014 for example, just being able to see and visually examine the patient. Providers say they really like being able to see a patient\u2019s home environment and for the patient to open up their medicine cabinet and show what\u2019s in it.\u201d\nHowever, it\u2019s also true that many patients don\u2019t like video for this very reason \u2014 they don\u2019t want to let providers into their homes, particularly if they haven\u2019t developed a trusting relationship with the provider.\nNeighborhood Healthcare in San Diego County and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) were two FQHCs that invested in video telehealth early in the pandemic. They reported that there were considerable growing pains in getting both patients and physicians to use the technology.\nIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is.\n\u2014Amanda Churape, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital\n\u201cWhat comes with integrating a new workflow is a lot of hesitancy, so our numbers were pretty low in the beginning,\u201d said Amanda Churape, a specialty care program manager at ZSFG. \u201cA lot of our providers and staff had actually never used Zoom or had never really had experience doing video, so there was a lot of training that needed to be done.\u201d\nSignificant numbers of patients and providers did not have a Zoom-compatible device at all, she said.\n\u201cWe started pushing very early on to go to video, and that was a challenge simply because those platforms, at that time, were just poorly developed,\u201d said Jeffrey Glenn, chief operating officer at Neighborhood. \u201cOur visits are 15 minutes apiece, so the providers would tell us, \u2018I can\u2019t spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to connect the patient.\u2019 And so early on, they would give up quickly and they would say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to call you.\u2019\u201d\nRamping Up Capabilities\nTo assist with the transition to remote provider visits, CHCF \u2014 which had funded projects working to expand use of the model even before the pandemic \u2014 launched the $6 million Tipping Point for Telehealth Initiative to help FQHCs ramp up their digital capabilities. The initiative included a learning collaborative on how to provide telehealth most effectively, dubbed the Connected Care Accelerator, as well as grants to enable clinics to invest in training and equipment.\nClinics were given flexibility in how they used the money as long as they applied it to expanding their telehealth capacity. Some of the clinics used the money to hire a specialized coordinator, like Churape, who oversees a team of telehealth ambassadors who help set up patients for video visits. First, the ambassadors screen patients to see if they have a device with a camera and access to Wi-Fi or an unlimited data plan. Then the ambassadors teach the patient how to download the application, join the meeting, and troubleshoot audio and video issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is,\u201d Churape said. \u201cWhat took the most time is actually getting the patient onto the application, teaching them how to download the application, teaching them how to join a meeting.\u201d\nOther FQHCs, including Neighborhood, used the grant money to buy equipment like iPads and rolling workstations to provide virtual visits at their clinics. Medical assistants move the rolling video displays between exam rooms and queue up patient calls, allowing physicians to transition seamlessly back and forth between in-person and telehealth visits.\n\u201cA provider may be in Exam Room A seeing a patient in person, but then when they get done and walk into the next room, there may be a virtual patient sitting on the iPad,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIn the very beginning we felt like we need to have dedicated providers, like 100% telehealth or 100% in-person. Then we graduated to this hybrid model, which we are still employing today.\u201d\nLooking Ahead: A Hybrid Model of Care\nEven with all the work they\u2019ve put in, Neighborhood and ZSFG say most of their telehealth visits are still conducted via telephone. That may be because many of the populations the clinics serve face the greatest barriers to accessing care: the elderly, people experiencing homelessness, and people with limited English proficiency. Uscher-Pines worries that those patients, who are only able to obtain audio telehealth services, may be receiving lower quality care as a result.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a little bit concerning is that [these] patients are getting an untested service,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cIt may be that audio-only visits are appropriate for many different use cases, but the literature just isn\u2019t there yet to support when it\u2019s appropriate and when it\u2019s not.\u201d\nGiven the advantages and drawbacks of telehealth, audio, and video, many providers are now calling for a hybrid model of care, offering a mix of in-person and virtual appointments depending on the patient and purpose of the visit.\n\u201cTelehealth quality is really complicated. The question is not \u2018Does telehealth work?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Does telehealth work for this patient population with this condition served in this setting?\u2019\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s clear from the RAND report is that the flexibility of telehealth is valuable for many patients and providers, with one-third of visits conducted virtually over a year into the pandemic. Making sure that these appointments, whether they are conducted by phone or video, are accessible, and are of the highest quality, will be critical in ensuring equitable care for patients who face barriers to in-person visits, even after the COVID-19 public health emergency is over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDana G.

With telemedicine, patients can now receive medical advice, diagnosis, disease management and treatment from the comfort of their homes, increasing their access to care and eliminating physical barriers created by hospital capacity, distance or transportation.\nThis report examines the continued adoption of telemedicine, its applications across various specialties and health care services, and its effects on physician well-being, patient access, and continuity of care. Study findings show that 88% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, with many reporting reduced wait times, improved adherence to treatment plans, and decreased no-show rates. Additionally, a consider- able portion of physicians surveyed reported that telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules and positively impacted their feelings of autonomy and work-life balance. Beyond expanding access to health care, telemedicine may also be increasing patients\u2019 willingness to seek medical attention. The majority of all patients surveyed (70%) said they may be more likely to consult with a doctor if they can do so virtually, with convenience and efficiency being primary drivers of adoption. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year, 85% said it resulted in equivalent or superior quality of care, with the majority reporting increased satisfaction. As the digitization of health care continues, telemedicine is poised to main- tain a pivotal role in health care delivery. Telemedicine and in-person care are not mutually exclusive, and uniting both can help reduce costs, expand access, and improve care for everyone. With further identification and im- plementation of best practices, telemedicine\u2019s capacity to personalize care models, promote continuity of care, and improve patient outcomes will only get stronger.\nReport Introduction 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Introduction 03 Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 04 An analysis of fee-for-service Medicare telemedicine claims throughout 2022 revealed that nearly 47% of billing physicians were users of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform. In the last quarter of 2022 (October to December) alone, Doximity's telemedicine tools were used by over 375,000 unique clinicians.* To gain a deeper understanding of the progression and sustained utilization of telemedicine, Doximity conducted an analysis of how its physician members, across all specialties and practice areas, used its telemedicine tools throughout 2022. To supplement this data, Doximity conducted a survey of over 1,200 of its physician telemedicine users across nine specialties: cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and psychiatry.\n*As reported on February 9, 2023 during Doximity\u2019s Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter earnings call 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 05 Physician Insights Telemedicine Insights from Doximity's Physician Membership 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 06 The metro areas with the highest physician adoption of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform in 2022 ranged across all regions of the U.S. New York had the highest overall adoption of telemedicine among physicians, followed by Chicago and Boston.\nMetro Areas with the HIGHEST HIGHEST Adoption 1.

This trend may be attributed to telemedicine\u2019s ability to promote continuity of care and long-term patient-physician relationships. Among all physicians surveyed, over 83% reported they found telemedicine useful in enhancing continuity of care for patients with complex or chronic conditions, and nearly two-thirds (65%) said telemedicine improved communication with their patients. 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 08 Adoption by Specialty Adoption of Telemedicine Highest in Specialties that Manage Chronic Illness 1.

Psychiatry Top Specialty by Adoption Rate \"I\u2019m an advanced heart failure cardiologist, and there are not many of us in the state. With telemedicine, patients now have access to subspecialists which may not be available in their area. In addition, follow ups for things like adjusting a heart failure therapy can be done via telemedicine, eliminating the need for patients to drive long distances for a short office visit. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve learned telemedicine is not a replacement, but a complement to our practices. \u2013 Munir Janmohamed, MD, Medical Director Heart Failure, Dignity Health Medical Foundation 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 09 As health care becomes more digitized, physicians across specialties are integrating telemedicine into their practices. In a survey of Doximity's telemedicine users, nearly 84% of physicians reported using telemedicine at least weekly, with 40% incorporating it into their daily clinical practice. The highest reports of daily use were among psych- iatrists at 84%, followed by endocrinologists at 57%. Looking ahead, the increasing popularity of mobile medicine and remote patient monitoring devices \u2014 estimated to reach 60.6 million U.S. patients by 20243 \u2014\u00ad is likely to drive further demand for reliable and complementary telemedicine solutions.\nFrequency of Use Many Physicians Incorporating Telemedicine into Daily, Weekly Practice *May not sum to 100 due to rounding numbers.\nHow often do you use telemedicine (via voice, video, text, etc.) in your practice?* Monthly 11% Quarterly 3% None of the Above 3% Participant None of the Ab Quarterly Monthly Daily Weekly 44% 40% 11% 3% 3% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 1 Daily 40% Weekly 44% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine As physicians lean into digital, they are embracing multiple telemedicine modalities, with video emerging as the most predominant among physicians surveyed. Audio-only phone visits are also widely employed, demonstrating the need for telemedicine tools that are versatile and adaptable to patients\u2019 needs. According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, Medicare patients with less technology access, lack of video experience, Latinx ethnicity, or limited English pro- ficiency, were all more likely to be offered telephone visits compared to video visits.4 These findings underscore the importance of audio-only options and the ongoing need for inclusive, flexible, and accessible telemedicine and product features that meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population.

While one of the most predominant applications among physicians is routine follow-up visits (92% of physicians surveyed), the majority of physicians surveyed (57%) use telemedicine to discuss lab and test results and treatment options with their patients, and this is even higher among oncologists (70%). Telemedicine also offers an important channel for prescription refills and timely follow-ups after a missed in-person visit, while playing a non-trivial role in remote patient monitoring, patient triage and urgent care. Notably, a recent study conducted by Epic Research found that most patients who had a telemedicine visit did not require an in-person follow-up appointment within the same specialty for three months. These findings suggest that telemedicine can provide effective medical attention without the need for additional in-person visits.5 Adoption by Use Case Telemedicine's Role Extends Beyond Routine Care How Physicians Apply Telemedicine in Clinical Practice: Routine Follow-Up Patient Visits Patient Consults Patient Triage Remote Patient Monitoring Test Results and Treatment Options Follow-Ups After Missed In-Person Visits Medication Management Urgent Care 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 12 While the pandemic certainly increased telemedicine use, the opportunity for better time management could help explain its continued adoption. Two-thirds of all physicians surveyed (66%) reported at least one time management benefit, such as greater autonomy and work-life balance, increased productivity, and easier schedule management. In fact, the majority of physicians surveyed reported telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules. As physicians continue to navigate burnout and overwork, these benefits could drive even greater adoption of telemedicine in the future.\nEffects on Productivity, Work-Life Balance Physicians Report Better Time Management \"Telemedicine has made it easier to manage my schedule.\" \"Telemedicine helps me be more productive and better serve my patients.\" \"Telemedicine has provided me with greater autonomy and work-life balance.\" \"Telemedicine helps me to provide care to more patients per day.\" Physician-Reported Benefits of Telemedicine Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 13 Telemedicine is also instrumental in addressing the costly and disruptive issue of patient no-shows for doctor visits. Approximately 61% of physicians surveyed reported a reduction in their patient no-show rates as a result of telemedicine, likely due to the increased convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of virtual care visits. Importantly, 77% of physicians said they have observed either equivalent or improved patient adherence to treatment plans through telemedicine, with less than 2% reporting decreased adherence.\nEffects on Patient Visit, Treatment Adherence Reduces No-Show Rates, Improves or Maintains Adherence to Treatment Plans How has telemedicine affected your patients' adherence to treatment plans?* Not applicable 1 Not applicable 1% Decreased adherence 2% Unsure 21% Increased adherence 37% No change 40% 1 Decreased adherence 2% No change in adherence 40% Increased adherence 37% *May not sum to 100, due to rounding numbers.\nUnsure 21% Not applicable 1% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 14 Patient access also appears to be a leading contributor to telemedicine adoption. Nearly 88% of physicians surveyed said telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, particularly among populations that may have faced barriers to care previously. Similarly, 87% of physicians reported telemedicine has enabled them to provide care to patients who face obstacles visiting their office in person. As additional benefits, nearly 44% of physicians found that telemedicine has actually reduced wait times for their patients, while 41% said telemedicine has expanded their community reach and referral networks.\nEffects on Patient Access Physicians Report Improved Access, Reduced Wait Times for Patients Physicians Who Agree Telemedicine Has Increased Patient Access to Health Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree 88 Neutral 10 Disagree 3 Disagree 3% Neutral 10% Agree 87% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Approximately 92% of physicians surveyed identified ease of use as a key factor in promoting patient access, followed by cross-device compatibility, allowing access from both desktop and mobile devices. Notably, the majority of physicians surveyed identified the ability to avoid application downloads and login-protected patient portals as important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine.\nFactors Influencing Patient Access Ease of Use, Cross-Device Compatibility Key Attributes for Patient Access Which of the following features are important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine?\nEase of use Accessibility across desktop and mobile No application download required No patient portal log-in required Ability to add family member or care partner Language support (translation or interpreter service) 0 100 75 50 25 92% 81% 71% 56% 55% 42% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 16 As telemedicine\u2019s role in U.S. health care continues to evolve, pay parity and the ability to offer telemedicine services across state lines will continue to be two issues that can greatly impact patient access. Among all physicians surveyed, over 78% indicated they believe there should be pay parity between telemedicine and in-person visits, and nearly 84% said the ability to practice telemedicine across state lines is critical to improving patient access to specialists and other timely care. With a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034,1 telemedicine is likely to play a significant role in promoting patient access to care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.\nPolicies to Preserve Patient Access Pay Parity, Licensing Across State Lines Critical to Patient Access Percentage of Physicians Who Agree There Should Be Pay Parity Between Telemedicine and In-Person Visits Percentage of Physicians Who Agree Ability to Practice Telemedicine Across State Lines is Critical to Improving Patient Access to Specialists, Other Timely Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree Neutral Disagree Disagree 4% Neutral 12% Agree 84% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Survey respondents included 1,200 patients who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 patients who did not. Among all respondents surveyed, the majority reported participating in a telemedicine visit within the last year (between March 2022 to March 2023). The following analyses examine these patients' direct experiences with telemedicine, as well as broader trends and preferences among the full patient cohort.\nPatient Insights Tracking Patient Perception and Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 19 In 2022, telemedicine reached the 80% adoption mark overall, becoming the preferred channel for prescription care and minor illness.6 While this is a significant milestone, the frequency of telemedicine use is also noteworthy. Based on survey results, nearly 60% of patients who had a telemedicine visit in the past year participated in a minimum of three virtual visits. Over one in five (21%) participated in six or more visits, and this frequency was similar among patients with and without chronic illnesses. Further, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported it improved their access to health care services.\nTelemedicine Use Among Patients Patients Report Recurring Use of Telemedicine Within One-Year Period In the past year, how many times did you meet with a doctor virtually?* Has virtual care improved your access to health care services?* *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nFundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold 6+ times 21 3-5 times 38 1-2 times 41 41% 38% 21% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundrais Participant Unsure No No Change Yes 76% 17% 5% 2% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 3-5 Times 38% No 5% Unsure 2% 1-2 Times 41% Yes 76% 6+ Times 21% No Change 17% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 20 Patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year identified a number of reasons for adoption, with efficiency and convenience being primary drivers. Telemedicine enables patients to consult with their doctors from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to interrupt their daily routines or commute to a doctor's office. Importantly, more than one in four patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year reported opting for a virtual visit because they did not believe their situation warranted an in-person appointment. This suggests that telemedicine could play a vital role in ensuring patients less inclined to visit a doctor's office still receive timely medical evaluation. In fact, the majority of all patients surveyed (70%) indicated they may be more likely to consult with a doctor in a non-emergency situation if the visit could be conducted virtually.\nFactors Driving Telemedicine Adoption Efficiency, Convenience Leading Drivers of Patient Adoption *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nWhy did you see your doctor virtually within the past year?* Easier than in-person visit (more convenient) Faster than in-person visit Concerns about COVID-19 and other infections Didn't feel in-person was needed (didn't feel bad enough) Difficulty getting to doctors office Couldn't miss work 0 60 45 30 15 53% 43% 31% 27% 26% 16% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 21 Over the past year, patients participated in telemedicine visits to receive a number of health care services, ranging from routine check-ups to appointments to discuss test results and treatment options. While follow-up appointments appear to be one of the primary applications of telemedicine use, this is likely due to the comprehensive nature of these visits, which can encompass various health care services. Among all patients who had a virtual care visit in the past year, approximately one in three patients (34%) used telemedicine to discuss their medications with their doctor or to refill their prescriptions, while roughly one in five used telemedicine to review test or treatment options. Notably, some of the highest use of telemedicine for these services was among patients with chronic illnesses.\nAdoption by Health Care Service Strong Telemedicine Adoption for Routine Visits, Medication Management What type(s) of care have you received virtually in the past year?\nFollow-ups after an in-person visit Regular check-ups Medication management and refills Review of test or lab results Mental health appointments Review of test or treatment options Same-day appointments (non-emergency) Urgent or emergency care Remote monitoring device check-up 0 50 38 25 13 46% 36% 34% 32% 25% 20% 17% 11% 9% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 22 Patients are also embracing a variety of telemedicine modalities to cater to their diverse needs and preferences. These modalities include video consultations, audio-only phone calls, and chat or text messaging. Among all patients surveyed, video emerged as the most preferred modality, with audio- only phone visits closely behind. These relatively strong preferences across modalities underscore the need for adaptable and flexible telemedicine solutions that can promote a positive patient experience for all.\nPreferences by Modality Patients Report Similar Preferences for Video, Audio-Only Visits Which types of virtual care formats do you prefer?\nAll Patients Patients with Telemedicine Visit in Past Year Video Phone (audio only) Chat or text messaging I prefer to meet with my doctor in person 15 0 30 45 60 42% 56% 39% 46% 27% 31% 27% 13% Computer (laptop/desktop) 51% Tablet or iPad 38% Home phone or basic cell phone 20% Wi-Fi or Internet 54% Among all patients surveyed, the majority (77%) reported having regular access to a smartphone, making it the most commonly available device for virtual health care visits. This was followed by computers at 51% and tablets at 38%. Importantly, only 54% of respondents reported having reg- ular access to Wi-Fi, underscoring the need for flexible telemedicine solutions that can easily adapt to meet individual patients\u2019 needs, including adjusting for no or low internet connection. In terms of patient preferences, 60% of respondents indicated a strong preference for using mobile devices for telemedicine visits, with less than one-fourth (24%) reporting a preference for computers.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report 23 Device Access and Preferences Patients Continue to Favor, Depend on Smartphones Which of the following resources do you have regular access to for virtual health care visits?\nSmartphone 0 20 40 60 80 77% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 24 Consistent with prior year findings, patients continue to report equivalent or superior quality of care as the result of their experience with telemedicine. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit within the past year, 85% reported their overall care was better or about the same with virtual care, and over half indicated increased satisfaction. These results underscore telemedicine\u2019s ability to enhance patient experiences and outcomes, making it a valuable tool in modern health care delivery.\nTelemedicine Satisfaction, Quality of Care Patients Report Increased Satisfaction, Equivalent or Superior Quality of Care Which of the following best represents your experience with virtual care overall?* How has virtual care affected your satisfaction with your care?* F Participant My overall care My overall care My overall care same Unsure 9% 46% 39% 6% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold My overall care is worse 7 My overall care is better 34 Increased Satisfaction 54 Unsure 5 5% 54% 34% 7% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Increased satisfaction 54% Unsure 9% Unsure 5% Decreased satisfaction 7% My overall care is worse 6% No change in satisfaction 34% My overall care is about the same 46% My overall care is better 39% *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 25 Expectations for Future Use Patients Emphasize Importance of Virtual Care Options Nearly 67% of patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year emphasized the importance of their doctor providing virtual care options, and this number was even higher among patients who had three or more telemedicine visits (72%). Notably, the large majority of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year (83%) indicated they expect to maintain or increase their usage of telemedicine in the future.\nof patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year indicated they expect to maintain or increase their usage of telemedicine in the future 83% Conclusion, Methodology, & Sources 26 With strong adoption among physicians and patients, telemedicine is poised to maintain an important role in health care delivery, particularly as the U.S. contin- ues to grapple with physician burnout and shortage and an aging population. Moving forward, uniting telemedicine with in-person care will help personalize care models, promote more equitable access to care, and strengthen the overall health care system for all. By leveraging the advantages of both telemedicine and in-person care, physicians as well as care teams can create flexible and adaptable models that better meet the diverse needs of their patients. This flexibility could also provide much- needed support for physicians and other medical professionals, as they continue to navigate a complex and evolving health care landscape.\nConclusion, Methodology & Sources Conclusion 27 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 28 Physician Insights Medicare Telemedicine Insights: Doximity partnered with CareJourney, a health analytics organization, to measure the number of physicians billing a set of Medicare telemedicine codes throughout 2022. The corresponding national provider identifier (NPI) numbers were compared to Doximity user data to assess the rate at which this cohort used Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform. Adoption by Age and Metro Areas: Responses were drawn from physicians who were users of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform in 2022. Data was mapped across metropolitan statistical areas.\nSpecialty Rank: The specialty rank list was drawn from physicians who were users of our telemedicine platform in 2022. Pediatric specialties and some adult subspecialties were folded into their adult general specialty. For example, colorectal surgery was included in general surgery.\nPhysician Survey: Doximity conducted a survey of its physician telemedicine users via SurveyMonkey to supplement its existing physician adoption insights. This survey was completed by over 1,200 U.S. physicians across nine different specialties: cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, oncology, pulmonology, psychiatry, and rheumatology. Doximity conducted the survey in March 2023. Survey participant demographics are not population-based and findings therefore may not be able to be extrapolated to the broader physician population.\nPatient Insights Doximity powered this section from a patient survey conducted via Pollfish. This survey included 2,400 U.S. adults. The survey was distributed to two respondent groups: 1,200 respondents who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 respondents who identified as not having a chronic illness. Doximity conducted the survey in March 2023. Survey participant demographics are not population-based and findings therefore may not be able to be extrapolated to the general population.\nMethodology 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 29 \u00b9 The Complexities of Physician Supply and Demand: Projections From 2019 to 2034.

COVID-19 patients who were isolated and received HBIC were monitored through telephone consultations (TC), in-person TC visits, and a self-reporting application. By evaluating patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC, healthcare providers could gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the HBIC program.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study design enrolled 444 HBIC patients who answered a structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model assessed the association between independent variables and patient satisfaction. The length of stay in HBIC was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. The data collection started on April (1\u201330), 2022, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nResults: The median age was 34, and 247 (55.6%) were females. A greater proportion (313, 70.5%) of the participants had high satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AOR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those who were symptomatic (AOR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were found to be significant factors for high user satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and more in-person visits (>1 visit) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001) had greater chances to reduce the length of stay in the COVID-19 HBIC.\nConclusion: 70.5% of the participants had high satisfaction with the system, and frequent phone call follow-ups on patients\u2019 clinical status can significantly improve their satisfaction and length of recovery. An in-person visit is also an invaluable factor in a patient\u2019s recovery.\n1 Introduction\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on numerous countries, resulting in a staggering number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Specifically, 774,771,942 confirmed cases and 7,035,337 deaths were reported globally. In Africa, approximately 9,576,309 confirmed cases and 175,500 deaths have been recorded, whereas Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths (1). Given the outbreak\u2019s severity and the prevailing epidemiological situation, the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia has taken swift action by developing, approving, and implementing a national guide on home-based isolation and care (HBIC). This guide is tailored for asymptomatic and mildly confirmed COVID-19 cases (2). Consequently, many patients have enrolled in the system, establishing a comprehensive telephone consultation (TC) service. Healthcare workers from health centers have been diligently monitoring the clinical condition of these patients through regular phone calls or in-person visits (2). The national or regional COVID-19 emergency centers are available for assistance to ensure that patients receive the necessary support and information. Patients facing challenges or requiring guidance on the system\u2019s functioning, worsening symptoms, medication advice, or ambulance requests can reach these centers (2). This approach provides comprehensive care and support to individuals affected by COVID-19 in Ethiopia.\nSeveral studies have emphasized the utilization of teleconsultations (TC) in Sub-Saharan Africa amid the COVID-19 outbreak. For instance, a study conducted at the Aga Khan Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, revealed varying frequencies of TC calls over 3\u2009months, with peaks observed at 7\u2009weeks and lows at 13\u2009weeks (3). In Uganda, the Ministry of Health rolled out TC services across multiple health centers simultaneously (4). Similarly, in Cameroon, many physicians resorted to TC consultations during the pandemic, often using WhatsApp applications (5). Despite the progress in telemedicine practices, assessing the quality of care provided through these methods is crucial. Quality indicators for telemedicine outcomes include mortality rates, average length of stay, and complication rates (6). The adoption of telemedicine has played a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of diagnosis and treatment in primary public hospitals (7). This is evident in the reduction of treatment duration, decrease in the average length of hospital stays, and decline in the percentage of critically ill patients (8). Moreover, telemedicine aids in improving personalized care and broadening the accessibility of medical services. Healthcare providers can deliver more efficient and effective patient care by harnessing telemedicine, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (9, 10). Patient satisfaction is a significant indicator of the societal perception of healthcare services, particularly in telemedicine. The practical advantages of telemedicine further underscore its social reputation within primary healthcare facilities. First, Telemedicine plays a crucial role in alleviating the financial burden on patients and their families by eliminating expenses associated with transportation and accommodation (11). Second, the efficient nature of telemedicine expedites disease diagnosis and treatment, thereby mitigating patients\u2019 suffering (11). Lastly, telemedicine\u2019s unique \u201cface-to-face\u201d communication system fosters a novel connection between medical professionals and patients, ultimately enhancing the healthcare experience (12, 13). Despite numerous studies, the findings remain inconclusive and conflicting. Some researchers suggested recruiting adaptable patients who embrace this new technology\u2019s convenience (14). Conversely, others highlight limitations, such as the relative novelty of telehealth in medicine, which makes it challenging to compare its outcomes with those of more traditional interventions (15). In addition, patient satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors. However, the factors influencing patient satisfaction in different settings or conditions remain debated (15).\nPatient satisfaction and length of stay are crucial metrics for assessing the quality of healthcare programs. This study aimed to provide insights into the factors influencing the satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC of COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This study uses traditional care (TC) and hybrid (in-person-TC) approaches in different sub-city areas. By understanding these factors, policymakers can develop strategic plans to improve the quality of healthcare services, thereby ensuring high satisfaction levels and shorter medical residence stays. The findings of this study can also inform the National Public Health Emergency Operation Center and the Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia on how to intervene and strengthen the healthcare system. In addition, the results can contribute to expanding telemedicine services and adopting digital health technologies in the country\u2019s healthcare sector.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Study area\nThis study focuses on Addis Ababa, primarily because of the significant burden of COVID-19 cases. Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths, with nearly 67% of these cases originating in Addis Ababa (1). Moreover, implementing the COVID-19 HBIC model in Addis Ababa surpasses other regions. Furthermore, the HBIC\u2019s self-reporting and follow-up application is exclusively available in Addis Ababa, making it an ideal location for research. Addis Ababa is divided into 11 sub-cities [Addis Ketema, Akaky Kaliti, Arada, Bole, Gullele, Kirkos, Kolfe Keranio, Lideta, Nefas Silk-Lafto, Yeka, Lemi Kura (New)], all of which have adopted the HBIC system for COVID-19 patients since the initial case was identified. The digital follow-up tool was specifically launched in the Bole sub-city (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Addis Ababa district locations. This map of the 11 Addis Ababa sub-cities is included in this study. Lemi Kura is a new district and is not included in this map.\n2.2 Study period\nThe study was conducted from 1 to 30 April 2022 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.3 Telemedicine medical team and technology\nEach sub-city is equipped with two to four health centers that serve as the base for the telemedicine medical team. A well-established system ensures that patient data is promptly transmitted to follow-up teams, enabling healthcare workers to initiate their follow-up procedures without delay. To support this initiative, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Addis Ababa Health Bureau allocated a tablet with complimentary airtime to each sub-city proportionate to the needs of the telemedicine medical team.\n2.4 Population studied\nThis study encompasses all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were isolated, received care at home, and met the criteria for inclusion. The study population consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to HBIC from its inception, aged between 18 and 60, individuals who underwent regular follow-up assessments while at HBIC, and those whose contact information was documented in the registry.\n2.5 Patient\u2019s independent variables\nPatients were classified based on the following criteria: Gender (male, female), Age (<30, 31\u201340, 41\u201350, 51\u201360\u2009years), city of residence, education level (no education and elementary, secondary and diploma, degree and above), occupation (government employee, private employee, self-employee, not working), symptoms (asymptomatic, symptomatic), type of attention (only telephone call\u2014TC, telephone call with in-person visits - in-person-TC), frequency of calls (\u22642 calls, \u22653 calls), and frequency of in-person visits (no visits, \u22642 visits, \u22653 visits).\n2.6 Study design\nA cross-sectional research design assessed two primary variables: patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC in days. The formula for a single population proportion was applied to determine the required population size of 385 (with a Z-score of 1.96, an outcome proportion of 50%, and a marginal error of 5%). The technique of proportionate stratified sampling involved dividing the entire population into 11 strata or sub-cities. The total sample size was then distributed proportionally among each sub-city based on the burden of the disease. Study participants were selected from each stratum or sub-city using systematic probability sampling (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Data collection. Sampling technique from each sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.7 Data collection tools, techniques, and quality assurance\nA validated patient satisfaction survey from the teleneurology program in Chile (13) employed a Likert scale to assess the extent of patient satisfaction. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected, a pretest was conducted on a random sample of 23 (5%) patients. Based on the findings from the pretest, necessary amendments were made to the data collection tool. Additionally, the collected data underwent daily reviews for clarity and completeness checks. Before analysis, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was evaluated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha test (13). The local language was used during data collection to ensure the required information was collected with greater understanding. To facilitate this, the data collection questionnaire was first developed in English and then translated into Amharic, and the data collected were back-translated to English for consistency. The data collectors administered the questionnaire over the telephone, and responses were recorded on the individual datasheets. Training on the basics of the questionnaire and how to use it appropriately was given by the principal investigator for two BSc nurses for 2\u2009days.\n2.8 Patient satisfaction survey\nThe final questionnaire consisted of 17 closed-response questions, each assigned a numerical value ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The questions were categorized into four contextualized areas. The overall score on the questionnaire, with a maximum of 85 points, served as an indicator of patient satisfaction. The scoring system classified satisfaction levels as follows: very low (17 points or below), low (18\u201334 points), moderate (35\u201351 points), high (52\u201368 points), and very high (69\u201385 points). Following completion of the survey, patients were divided into two main groups based on their scores: (i) those with a score below 51 points, indicating moderate or low patient satisfaction, and (ii) those with a score over 52 points, indicating high or very high patient satisfaction (Table 1).\nTable 1. Study questionnaire.\r\n\n2.9 Data and outcomes analysis\nSummary statistics, including frequency, percentage, median, and interquartile range, were utilized to summarize the characteristics of patients and other relevant information. This research aimed to assess the relationship between the independent variables and two primary outcomes: (i) the level of patient satisfaction and (ii) the length of stay in the HBIC. The binary logistic regression (Backwald) model was employed to examine the independent variables associated with patient satisfaction, and the findings were presented as odds ratios (OR). Cox regression (Backwald) analysis was conducted to evaluate the independent variables linked to the length of stay in HBIC, and the results were reported as hazard ratios (HR). To compare the means of length of stay in HBIC, a non-normal distribution, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for independent samples was employed, while the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. The significance level was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 26.\n2.10 Ethical considerations\nThe study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee. Oral informed consent was obtained from the participants before any form of data collection. Participants\u2019 contact information was obtained after a formal request was made to the Addis Ababa Health Bureau. Demographic data of all participants and survey responses were anonymously collected and entered. Access to the collected information was limited to the authors, and confidentiality was maintained throughout the project.\n3 Results\n3.1 Data collection\nA 17-question structured questionnaire was developed by reviewing similar studies (Table 1) (13). Upon completing a reliability assessment of the survey, the internal reliability of the survey was robust, as evidenced by a Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of 0.96 (data not shown). The study included 509 patients, yielding a response rate of 87.2% (n\u2009=\u2009444). Among the non-respondents (n\u2009=\u200965, 12.8%), the reasons provided for their lack of participation were as follows: 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) had incorrect contact information, and another 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) did not receive any follow-up, either in-person or through phone communication. The remaining 60% (n\u2009=\u200939) of participants displayed uncooperative behavior, as their phones were inactive, unreachable, or did not answer (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Patient\u2019s response from telephone calls. Response rate and reasons for non-response include: (i) wrong phone number, (ii) no follow-up, and (iii) other.\n3.2 Population description, patient satisfaction, and length of stay in HBIC\nThe descriptive statistics of the 444 patients who participated in the study are below. The median age was 34\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years, with an age distribution as follows: Age:<30 (n\u2009=\u2009164, 36.9%); 31\u201340 (n\u2009=\u2009141, 31.8%); 41\u201350 (n\u2009=\u200987, 19.6%); and 51\u201360 (n\u2009=\u200952, 11.7%). The gender distribution of the patients was as follows: Female 247 (55.6%) (Table 2). We outline the performance of the HBIC system according to the patient satisfaction parameter. Due to the low frequency obtained in the lower user satisfaction groups (very low, low, and moderate), we grouped patients into two major groups according to the degree of user satisfaction: low or moderate and high or very high. patients with high or very high user satisfaction represent 313 (70.5%). When we break down this group by gender, we see that women have a slightly higher percentage of high or very high user satisfaction than men, with 177 (56.9%) females. However, no statistically significant differences are observed. Analyzing the distribution of patients with high and very high user satisfaction by age, we observe that more than 50% of patients are concentrated in a population under 40\u2009years old (Table 2). The length of stay for patients with high or very high satisfaction varied depending on certain variables. The average length of stay for females was 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, while for males, it was 16\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, and in terms of age groups, patients showed similar lengths between 14 and 16 days (Table 2).\nTable 2. Patient\u2019s demographic variables.\r\n\nThe distribution of patients according to sub-city of residence was found to be quite homogeneous, with some exceptions as detailed below: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200962, 14.0%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Arada (n\u2009=\u200943, 9.7%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200977, 17.3%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200959, 13.3%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u200911, 2.5%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200936, 8.1%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200922, 5.0%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u200916, 3.6%). Patients with high or very high satisfaction were distributed according to sub-city of residence as follows: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200948, 10.8%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200935), Arada (n\u2009=\u200932, 7.2%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200957, 12.8%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%, 7.9%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u20096, 1.4%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200923, 5.2%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200920, 4.5%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200918, 4.1%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u20098, 1.8%) (Table 2). Regarding the city of origin, the average length of stay varied as follows: Addis Ketema (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Akaki Kality (16\u2009\u00b1\u20098), Arada (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Bole (14\u2009\u00b1\u20093), Gulele (17\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Kirkos (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Kolfe Keranyo (16\u2009\u00b1\u20096), Lideta (14\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Nefas Silk Lafto (20\u2009\u00b1\u20097), Yeka (15\u2009\u00b1\u20097), and Lemi Kura (14\u2009\u00b1\u20097) (Table 2).\nThe patient\u2019s satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC can be influenced by various factors, including the patient\u2019s level of education and occupation. The distribution of patients\u2019 education level is as follows: 79 patients (17.8%) had no education or only completed elementary school, 174 patients (39.2%) had completed secondary school or obtained a diploma, and 191 patients (43.0%) had a degree or higher education. The distribution of patients\u2019 occupation is as follows: 121 patients (27.3%) were government employees, 114 patients (25.7%) were private employees, 120 patients (25.0%) were self-employed, and 89 patients (20.0%) were not working (Table 2). The majority of patients who showed high or very high user satisfaction have higher levels of education: Education: No Educ and Elementary (n\u2009=\u200945, 10.1%), Secondary and Diploma (n\u2009=\u2009125, 28.2%), Degree and above (n\u2009=\u2009143, 32.2%); however, the distribution was found to be more symmetrical according to the occupational level of these patients: Government employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.0%), Private employee (n\u2009=\u200985, 19.1%), Self-employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.1%), Not working (n\u2009=\u200968, 15.3%) (Table 2). No significant differences were found in the duration length of stay in HBIC among patients concerning their level of education and occupation type. The respective data for education are as follows: No Education and Elementary 14\u2009\u00b1\u20097, Secondary and Diploma 15\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Degree and above 17\u2009\u00b1\u20095. Similarly, the data for occupation type were: Government employee 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Private employee 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Self-employee 16\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Not working 18\u2009\u00b1\u20097 (Table 2).\nMost patients who participated in this study were symptomatic, accounting for 275 (61.9%) with an average length of stay for HBIC of 16 (\u00b16). Patients who displayed symptoms were more satisfied (n\u2009=\u2009215, 48.5%) than those who were asymptomatic (n\u2009=\u200998, 22.1%). The length of stay in HBIC for asymptomatic patients (14\u2009\u00b1\u20095), was slightly lower than that of Symptomatic patients (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095). However, no statistically significant differences were observed (data not shown).\nNext, we described the frequency of phone call follow-ups for patients during their stay at HBIC. The most common type of care was TC, with 330 patients (74.3%), followed by in-person and TC visits, with 114 patients (25.7%). The overall frequency of in-person visits was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20092 visits, and it can be further broken down as follows: no visits (n\u2009=\u2009330, 48.9%), \u22642 visits (n\u2009=\u200984, 18.9%), and\u2009\u2265\u20093 visits (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%). The average frequency of phone call follow-ups was 3\u2009\u00b1\u20096 calls, and we observe that the distribution of calls appears to be symmetrical: TC was \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009221, 49.8%) and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls (n\u2009=\u2009223, 50.2%).\nIn terms of the mode of care, patients who were exclusively contacted through teleconsultation (TC) 217 (48.9%) were more satisfied than those receiving hybrid care with both TC and in-person visits 96 (21.6%). Consistent with the findings, patients exhibited higher user satisfaction with an increased frequency of calls in TC, as those patients with more than \u22653 calls (n\u2009=\u2009184, 41.4%) expressed greater satisfaction compared to patients with less than or equal to \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009129, 29.1%) (Table 2). Upon analyzing the frequency of in-person visits, patients with fewer visits reported higher user satisfaction: No visits (n\u2009=\u2009217, 69.3%), 1 visit (n\u2009=\u200970, 22.0%), and\u2009\u2265\u20092 visits (n\u2009=\u200926, 8.3%).\nIt is important to mention that differences in patient length of stay were observed according to the type of care, as patients treated through the TC system 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095 stayed for a shorter period than those receiving hybrid care through TC and in-person visits 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). As expected, patients with more calls stayed longer in the HBIC system as described below: Frequency of calls in TC: \u22642 calls 13\u2009\u00b1\u20093, and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Table 2).\n3.3 Statistical analysis associated with patient satisfaction\nA binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to explore the variables associated with high or very high patient satisfaction levels. The results revealed that individuals who placed more than three calls (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those displaying symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were more inclined to report increased satisfaction. Nevertheless, no statistically significant relationships were found between user satisfaction and the other independent variables investigated (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 3).\nTable 3. Relevant demographic variables that influence patient satisfaction.\r\n\n3.4 Statistical analysis associated with patient length of stay in HBIC\nA Cox regression analysis was employed to examine the factors influencing the duration of hospital stays in patients who reported high levels of satisfaction. The findings revealed that patients who made more than three phone calls had a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000), indicating a greater likelihood of reducing their length of stay. Similarly, patients with more in-person visits also exhibited a lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). However, no statistically significant associations were observed between the length of stay and the other independent variables analyzed (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 4).\nTable 4. Cox regression analysis to elucidate the demographic variables associated with the length of stay in HBIC and patients\u2019 satisfaction.\r\n\n3.5 Statistical analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC\nPreviously, we identified the following variables that significantly influence patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC: the presence of symptoms, the number of phone calls, and in-person follow-ups. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between symptoms and patient satisfaction with the number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups (Table 5). It was noted that symptomatic patients with low or moderate satisfaction levels have an OR\u2009=\u20095.7 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and 7.6 times higher likelihood of having in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was notably longer for those with a higher number of phone calls. Conversely, patients with high or very high satisfaction levels have a 2.3 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was significantly longer for those with in-person follow-up. Sig p\u2009<\u20090.05 (Table 5).\nTable 5. Analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC.\r\n\n4 Discussion\nThis study aimed to evaluate the levels of patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC among COVID-19 patients while also examining the different factors that may impact these outcomes. Given the considerable number of COVID-19-positive instances and the limited bed availability at COVID-19-specific hospitals, the HBIC endorsed the practice of home isolation for COVID-19-affected persons. This directive was instituted because most COVID-19 patients were either asymptomatic or displayed mild symptoms. Such cases generally do not necessitate hospitalization at COVID-19-designated medical facilities and can be adequately managed at home with appropriate medical guidance and monitoring. The heightened level of patient satisfaction observed in symptomatic individuals treated by HBIC is supported by an associated investigation conducted through a survey-based study (10, 16\u201318).\nWe identified a noteworthy connection between a high or very high satisfaction level and the frequency of phone call follow-ups in patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Essentially, for each increment of one in the frequency of phone call follow-ups, the chances of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction rose by a factor of 2.8 (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000). This tendency may be attributed to patients encountering difficulties during their healthcare facility stay, and regular communication with the follow-up team assists in addressing some of these challenges. As per the National HBIC Guideline, the frequency of phone call follow-ups escalates as the severity of the COVID-19 illness worsens, with follow-ups occurring once a week, every 3\u2009days until discharge, and daily until discharge (19). Correspondingly, individuals exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms had 2.0 times greater odds of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction than those with asymptomatic disease (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Cox regression analysis uncovered a negative correlation between the length of stay in HBIC patients with high or very high satisfaction and the frequency of phone calls, follow-ups, and in-person visits. Specifically, the number of phone calls and in-person visits (with a minimum of two visits) emerged as significant factors impacting the length of stay. Upon adjusting for other variables, it was observed that with each additional phone call, the length of stay in the hospital-based isolation center (HBIC) decreased by 46.3% (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000). Similarly, after accounting for other covariates, the length of stay among COVID-19 patients who had more than one in-person visit was 50.5% lower compared to patients with no in-person visits (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Finally, this investigation determined that symptomatic patients with Low or Moderate satisfaction had a greater likelihood of experiencing a larger Number of Phone Calls, In-Person follow-ups, and a longer stay at HBIC compared to patients with high or very high satisfaction.\nUser satisfaction and length of stay have shown dissimilar results in different latitudes. A study conducted in general and university hospitals in the Netherlands found no evidence of a correlation between the average length of stay in hospital wards and patient satisfaction (20). Several studies conducted at the Nancy University Hospital Center in France and in training hospitals in Turkey and Japan (21\u201323) have found a connection between prolonged lengths of stay and decreased patient satisfaction. These studies have highlighted the importance of environmental factors in influencing patient satisfaction (24). However, a distinct study carried out in teaching hospitals in Turkey discovered that patients who stayed longer expressed higher satisfaction levels than those with shorter stays (25). Despite these variations, one can speculate about the reasons for higher user satisfaction in patients with greater follow-ups. Among these reasons, it can be argued that it is well-documented that telemedicine technology has the potential to enhance the quality of primary medical care, shorten the duration of treatment, and decrease the number of severe hospitalization cases (17). Telemedicine expands the availability of medical services and broadens the range of medical care, which is particularly crucial in Ethiopia, with a fragmented healthcare system and limited coverage (26, 27). The sharing of medical resources is especially significant for rural or isolated areas, and telemedicine offers a greater abundance of advanced medical resources for primary hospital consultations in these vast rural regions, thereby enhancing the quality of medical and healthcare services (10, 28, 29).\nThe incorporation of telemedicine into the healthcare systems of low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Ethiopia, has the potential to bring about cost savings and resource conservation in the long run. Consequently, this could alleviate the financial burden on individuals and enhance their access to affordable healthcare services (17). It is important to note that in many LMICs, a significant portion of overall health spending comes from out-of-pocket payments, as there is often no general health insurance available (30). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the already fragile healthcare systems in LMICs (10, 31). In this regard, telemedicine services could be crucial in relieving pressure on the healthcare system by saving time and resources and enhancing efficiency and accessibility. Additionally, telemedicine can facilitate social distancing measures and reduce the need for face-to-face interactions in hospitals and clinics, helping prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 through physical contact (10, 32). Furthermore, telemedicine can also be instrumental in providing counseling and specific advice to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as guidance on prevention measures. Overall, the adoption of telemedicine in LMICs holds great potential for addressing healthcare challenges, reducing costs, and improving access to quality care. It can serve as a valuable tool in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthening healthcare systems in these countries (33).\nThroughout the initial three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, most patients seeking medical care were directed to the HBIC. This strategic decision is believed to have effectively alleviated the potential burden of cases and prevented burnout among the existing treatment facilities (2). The HBIC specifically caters to COVID-19 patients and represents our country\u2019s pioneering national telehealth service. Therefore, it is crucial to examine its operational experiences thoroughly. The focus should be on integrating functionalities that encourage community acceptance of this telehealth modality. As COVID-19 patients continue to be enrolled in the HBIC, the findings from this study will serve as a valuable resource for the Ministry of Health and COVID-19 response teams in their efforts to enhance the healthcare system. The HBIC framework offers a practical solution for healthcare providers who aim to extend their services to patients residing in remote areas. Moreover, the growing acceptance and familiarity with telemedicine visits, driven by the pandemic, are likely to shape the future landscape of healthcare delivery for both patients and providers.\nThe study\u2019s findings should be evaluated considering the strengths and limitations identified. The study\u2019s strength lies in the thorough selection process of participants from various sub-cities throughout the entire duration of the service. The research questions were also carefully developed using a validated tool and assessed for internal consistency, ensuring their comprehensibility.\n4.1 Limitations\nIt is important to acknowledge a limitation of the study, which is the potential recall bias introduced by enrolling most patients during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this limitation, this study is expected to pave the way for advancements in telemedical services in Ethiopia. Furthermore, it can potentially expand and incorporate other telemedicine care modalities, such as videoconferencing, in the future.\n5 Conclusion\nThe investigation evaluated patient satisfaction and length of stay in telemedicine services. The findings revealed that most patients, accounting for over 70.5%, reported high or very high satisfaction with these services. Notably, patients who received frequent follow-up phone calls and exhibited symptomatic COVID-19 disease expressed higher satisfaction. Additionally, it was observed that a higher frequency of phone calls and in-person visits resulted in a shorter stay in the Hospital-Based Isolation Center (HBIC). Consequently, it is crucial to consider the aforementioned factors to enhance patient satisfaction and reduce the length of stay in HBIC or other telemedicine services. It is worth mentioning that the HBIC, which caters specifically to COVID-19 patients, represents the first large-scale national telemedicine service implemented in our country. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly examine the experiences gained from this service, with particular attention given to incorporating features that facilitate community acceptance and reimbursement of this mode of healthcare delivery. Meanwhile, as the enrollment of COVID-19 patients in the HBIC continues, the findings of this study will serve as a valuable resource for guiding the Ministry of Health, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, and the COVID-19 response team in their efforts to improve the system.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee.

A qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas. The study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Interview questions were focussed on the planning of COVID-19 vaccination in their area. Other questions were the problem faced during the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program and how it has been tackled.\nResults\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, online digital method of vaccination registration, overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were barriers to vaccination. Fear about vaccine adverse events, even in healthcare workers (HCWs), and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine, and also the fear about post-vaccination side effects have an impact on the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal areas.\nConclusion\nThe successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and capacity building of healthcare staff.\nKeywords: india, vaccination, outreach, barriers, facilitators, covid-19\nIntroduction\nOne of the greatest advancements in public health of the 20th century was the development of vaccines to prevent communicable diseases, which have prevented millions of deaths and saved billions of dollars [1]. Willingness to be vaccinated varies among individuals and groups based on various factors, including individual beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy.\u00a0Every Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccination has been reported to cause reluctance, including delays in or outright rejection of the vaccines by some medical professionals [2,3].\nThe national policy includes a thorough, secure, and effective immunization effort. Successful vaccine awareness campaigns typically employ multiple strategies [4]. India set a goal to vaccinate 300 million people against COVID-19 by August 2021, the largest immunization program\u00a0ever. This challenge was announced on January 16, 2021. The homegrown vaccines made by Bharat Biotech, Covishield and Covaxin have been licensed for limited emergency use by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI)\u00a0[5]. India simultaneously planned COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in both urban and rural areas. The designated manpower, such as midwives, auxiliary nurses, etc., from all the states, who played a significant part in the healthcare of people in rural India, were trained in COVID-19 immunization. Midwives and auxiliary nurse midwives, who have a far broader reach in the interior and rural areas, were included in the first set of health workers educated in vaccination skills because India planned to have COVID-19 immunization programs in the urban and rural areas at the same time. The government utilized allied healthcare personnel, including pharmacists and public health professionals, to scale up a vaccination campaign. Primary health centres are in charge of effectively implementing the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural areas [6]. So, the study was planned to seek insight into the challenges faced by health personnel in the effective implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program.\nMaterials and methods\nA qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Government Medical College Akola (MH). The study was conducted in a rural area of Akola district, which lies in the western parts of Maharashtra State and belongs to the Vidarbha region, and is said to be one of the progressive districts in the region. The district has one municipal corporation (Akola Municipal Corporation), six municipalities (Murtizapur; Akot; Balapur; Patur; Telhara and Barshitakli) and 535 Gram panchayat (Total 864 villages). According to the 2011 Census, the district has a total population of 18,13,906, comprising 10,94,165 persons in rural areas and 7,19,741 persons in urban areas accounting for 1.6 percent of the total population of the State [7].\u00a0In Akola district, there are 30 primary health centres and 178 subcentres.\nThe study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Informed consent was taken from each participant. Each subject gave their informed consent. The Government Medical College (GMC) Akola Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person between September 2021 and December 2021.\u00a0All participants were asked regarding problems faced during the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination in their area.\u00a0Interview questions included: (1) How do you plan for COVID vaccination in your area? (2) What are the problems faced during COVID vaccination?\u00a0(3) What measures had been taken to solve the problems? (4) What measures will you suggest to implement COVID vaccination in your area successfully?\u00a0The interviews lasted 20 to 30 minutes and were conducted in the participants' preferred language (Hindi, Marathi, or English). A brief introduction and explanation of the study goals opened the session. Confidentiality was maintained to all participants. Participants were made aware of the existence of no right or wrong responses. Participants were welcomed to express their opinions on the effective implementation and difficulties encountered with the COVID vaccine.\nTranscripts of all recordings were created. Two researchers independently read the transcripts before using descriptive words or phrases to code them. Then, areas of interest were assigned to the coded transcripts, and developing themes were described. Review and editing were done on these emergent topics as well as sample transcripts that had been coded. A written presentation of the data is used whenever necessary to highlight study findings with quotes.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nA total of 30 medical officers involved in COVID vaccination working at the primary health centres (PHCs) were interviewed.\u00a0Twelve individuals (12 [40%] women; mean [SD] age, 45.04 [6.9] years) participated (Table 1). Twenty-three (76.7%) participants had work experience of more than five years at PHC in a rural area.\u00a0A total of 16 (53.3%) medical officers held MBBS degrees.\nTable 1. Characteristics of study participants.\nBarriers and facilitators in COVID vaccination\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\nHealth system factors\nIn the initial phase of the mass COVID-19 vaccination program, the barrier to implementation was a shortage of vaccine supply. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session, like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. One key respondent mentioned that \u201cPeople unnecessarily argued for the non-availability of vaccine and created a panic situation that was difficult to handle by us. So we took help from the police department.\u201d\nRural or illiterate people did not prefer the online digital method of vaccination registration. Additionally, the network issue for registration was also one of the barriers to vaccination.\n\u201cDue to compulsory online registration for vaccination, people keep postponing for it.\u201d\nThe respondent also mentioned about the inconvenience to the people due to overcrowding highlighting the inadequate infrastructure as a barrier to vaccination.\nHuman resource factors\nRespondent mentioned that initially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers.\n\u201cInitially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers which led to misconception and rejection for vaccination.\u201d\nMost respondents referred to the general shortage of health personnel as a barrier to vaccination. The deficit in human resources affected the vaccination program and overburdened the healthcare workers; it affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal check-ups, Field visits, etc.\u00a0One respondent mentioned that, due to a shortage of manpower in some facilities only one health worker has to perform various tasks in vaccination such as registration, counselling of clients and administration of vaccine.\n\u201cThere should be proactive involvement of other than health department like for registration, teachers from primary school should be involved. Such involvement should not be on paper but actually on the field.\u201d\nThe poor attitude among health care workers and lack of commitment due to everyday daily vaccination sessions also were reported to impact negatively on the implementation of the program. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\nCommunity level factors\nRespondents also discussed the attitude of the community towards vaccination.\u00a0Most respondents viewed the misconception about the vaccine seen to undermine the delivery of COVID vaccine.\u00a0Respondents stated that there was high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine particularly.\u00a0Misconception and superstitious behaviour about the vaccine is present in some communities like Muslims, Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas. In Akola district, there were pockets of tribal populations; these populations were also not ready to take vaccines initially due to fear and mistrust.\nOne respondent said that:\n\u201cIn a few villages, people\u00a0were not ready to take the COVID vaccine, only after involving leaders from villages like Sarpanch and house-to-house counselling by Healthcare staff motivated the people for vaccination.\u201d\nMisconception and myths about the adverse outcome of the vaccine was a major barrier at the community level. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination. Pregnant women were also unwilling to take the COVID vaccination due to fear of side effects.\u00a0One respondent has mentioned that:\n\u201cInitially, people were unaware of the safety of vaccines. People had various misbeliefs about the efficacy and safety of vaccine like an increase in death rate after vaccination.\u201d\nSome respondents stated that vaccination session timing was not feasible, so people didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccine.\n\u201cIn rural areas, in the afternoon, people go to the field, which is more preferred than taking the vaccine, so we can\u2019t cover the total population.\u201d\nPost-vaccination side effects like fever, headache, and myalgia created fear among unvaccinated people.\nDiscussion\nThis qualitative study explored barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal blocks of Akola district.\u00a0The findings highlighted in our study were classified at three levels: health system, human resource and community.\u00a0There were several administrative barriers during the initial phase of the COVID pandemic. India is a big country with disparities in health literacy, access to care, and risk perception among the general public by area [7]. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. In the initial phase, online digital registration for COVID-19 vaccination and internet or mobile network issues in rural areas were critical issues for illiterate people in rural areas. Vaccinating the whole population was challenging even though the country has the largest vaccine-producing units [8]. More than 2.4 billion doses of the vaccine are produced in India each year, in addition to a variety of surgical and medical disposables such as vials, stoppers, syringes, gauze, and alcohol swabs. However, because this necessitates adhering to very strict temperature guidelines, the first barrier was the storage and delivery of the vaccinations until the inoculation sessions [9]. Representatives from the Government of India (GOI) claim that the current healthcare system may not need more personnel to administer the vaccine to healthcare professionals [9].\nIn relation to WHO standards, India's health worker density continues to be low. In addition to the scarcity, it is extremely difficult to keep skilled health workers in rural and neglected areas [7]. In our study, the general shortage of health personnel and overburdening the healthcare workers affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal Care Check-ups, field visits, etc. The frontline HCWs (FLHCWs) were particularly susceptible to increased work stress for a variety of reasons, such as having to work under stressful conditions because of rapidly changing guidelines, the inevitable need to be deployed to new settings and high-risk areas, the lack of adequate technical and human resources, and the worry that they might infect their families after work with COVID-19 [6]. In our study, fear about vaccine\u00a0adverse events even among healthcare workers (HCWs) was also a reason behind the effective implementation of the COVID vaccination program.\nA review by Biswas et al. indicated that 22.51% of 76,471 HCWs\u00a0worldwide reported COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy. Their main concerns with the vaccine were potential side effects (60%), safety (48%), and how well it works (30%). HCWs in this review also found higher vaccine acceptance in Whites and Asians [10]. A study conducted by Fu et al. on Chinese healthcare workers found that about 50% were unwilling to accept COVID-19 vaccination [11]. However, a study by Saudi healthcare workers\u00a0Magadmi and\u00a0Kamel\u00a0displayed hesitancy toward vaccination [12]. Medical professionals showed a high level of vaccine scepticism, according to Dror et al. [2]. Concerns about the safety of a quickly created vaccine were raised by several respondents who did not follow the recommendations for vaccines. In contrast, individuals who believed they had a higher risk of sickness showed greater vaccine acceptance [2].\nThe poor attitude among healthcare workers and lack of commitment due to daily vaccination sessions were also reported to impact the program's implementation negatively. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\u00a0Rao and\u00a0Chowdhury also mentioned that frontline workers across the country were the backbone of the Indian public health system [13]. They were underpaid, undervalued, and alienated without any state support or protection. Workloads were raised during the COVID epidemic. The lack of medical insurance, proper governmental support, decreased physical and mental health, and delayed payments all contributed to the financial vulnerability that the healthcare workforce was experiencing [13].\nIn our study, it was observed that misconception and superstitious behaviour about vaccines were present in some communities like Muslim\u00a0and Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas in the tribal block. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination [14,15]. Dutta et al. mentioned that various studies have identified myriad factors related to vaccination refusal and hesitancy, including refusal for religious, social, and philosophical reasons, lack of trust in vaccine providers and others, and fear of vaccines and adverse outcomes following immunization [16]. At the same time, King et al. mentioned that mandatory vaccination requirements must be planned with great care; there is no reason to think they are incompatible with human rights law [17]. So there is a need to create awareness regarding vaccination in the community. Vaccination session timing was not feasible for some people, so they didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccines.\nThe limitation of our study is that findings cannot be extended to wider area populations with the same degree of certainty as the research findings are not tested statistically. In our study, we focussed on the understanding and explanation of the dynamics of the implementation of COVID vaccination in rural areas, but we haven\u2019t quantified the coverage and issues. This can be better answered with further research with a mixed-method approach.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our findings were enablers and barriers for COVID-19 vaccination programs in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc., online digital method of vaccination registration and overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were a barrier to vaccination.\u00a0Fear about vaccine adverse events even in healthcare workers and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially, misconception about the vaccine, and fear about post-vaccination side effects impact the COVID-19 vaccine program in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0The successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and healthcare staff capacity building.\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nHuman Ethics\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.

Health insurance is compulsory, but people with an income above a fixed threshold or belonging to a particular professional group (e.g. self-employed people or civil servants) can opt out of SHI coverage and enrol in (substitutive) private health insurance (PHI). About 11 % of the population are covered by PHI; 89 % by SHI. Although coverage is universal for all legal residents and only 0.1 % of the population do not have health insurance, there are still gaps due to financial or administrative barriers (see Section 5.2). The multi-payer SHI system currently consists of 103 sickness funds and 41 PHI companies, and the three biggest sickness funds cover more than one third of the German population.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cIn Germany, 88\u00a0percent of the population is covered by statutory health insurance, which is financed by financially and organizationally independent statutory health insurance funds, and 9\u00a0percent of the population is privately insured.15\u00a0The guiding principle of the German statutory health insurance system is solidarity regarding both income and provision of services: All insured people contribute a share of their income, irrespective of their health risk, and people are entitled to benefits according to their health needs, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, ability to pay, or location.16\u00a0All employed people earning less than the opt-out threshold, people receiving welfare benefits, and pensioners have mandatory statutory health insurance, and their nonearning dependents are insured free of charge. People with high income and self-employed people can purchase private health insurance or keep the statutory health insurance. Coverage of services is roughly the same in both systems, apart from certain newly launched drugs, which are paid for by private insurance. There is no restriction on patients\u2019 choice of hospitals, and patient copays for hospital stays do not differ across hospitals.\u201d\nSource: Esra Eren Bayindir\u00a0and\u00a0Jonas Schrey\u00f6gg. Public Reporting Of Hospital Quality Measures Has Not Led To Overall Quality Improvement: Evidence From Germany. Health Affairs\u00a02023\u00a042:4,\u00a0566-574\n\u201cThe German health system has a complex governance structure. The federal government defines only the legal framework, while regulatory details are specified in directives issued by the Federal Joint Committee \u2013 the highest self-governing decision-making body in the country. The Committee consists of representatives of associations of sickness funds, physicians, dentists and hospitals, as well as three independent members (plus patient representatives without voting rights). It takes decisions on SHI benefits, reimbursement systems and quality assurance.\u201cThe states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) supervise the self-governing bodies at the regional level and are responsible for hospital planning and investments, as well as medical education. They are also responsible for public health services and the running of public health offices, which gained in importance during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the crisis revealed the challenges faced by federal systems in coordinating and managing the pandemic. Governance mechanisms have been put in place to enable rapid, cross-state measures to respond to the crisis through ordinance authorisations, particularly by the Federal Ministry of Health (Box 1).\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cThe German system provides universal population coverage either through social health insurance (SHI) (almost 90% of the population) or substitutive VHI [Voluntary Health Insurance]. As OOP [Out-Of-Pocket] policies of substitutive VHI vary widely (and data is largely unavailable), we focus on SHI. OOP spending in Germany is related to both direct payments for services not covered by SHI (e.g., over-the-counter drugs) and cost-sharing for SHI covered services, but the relative importance of cost-sharing versus direct payments is not known because of the health system\u2019s accounting methods. OOP spending above reference prices for dental care and medical aids can be substantial; for example, reference prices for dental care cover only about 50% of the costs of standard care. Cost-sharing requirements increased in 2004 for such things as prescription drugs, inpatient care, and physician and dental care, while at the same time adult eyeglasses were excluded from coverage. Since these increased requirements became effective in 2004 they do not affect the average growth rate in the 2004\u20132014 period and therefore do not contradict the observed drop in average growth in 2004\u20132014 compared to the 1994\u20132004 period. The most plausible explanation for the low growth in this period is the fact that in 2013, co-payments for physician visits were discontinued. The most important protection mechanism against OOPs is the exemption of children under 18\u00a0years of age and a maximum cost-sharing limit of 2% of annual income (or 1% for patients with severe chronic conditions). This has remained largely unchanged over the study period.\u201d\nRice, Thomas et al. \u201cRevisiting out-of-pocket requirements: trends in spending, financial access barriers, and policy in ten high-income countries.\u201d BMC health services research vol. 18,1 371. 18 May. 2018, doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3185-8.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government recently orchestrated a fundamental change to its public health infrastructure. This reconstruction centers around the founding of a National Institute for Prevention and Education in Medicine (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4vention und Aufkl\u00e4rung in der Medizin, BIPAM) at the cost of two federal institutions, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the Federal Center for Health Education (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, BzGA). Thus, the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, BMG) plans to dissolve the BzGA and integrate its personnel into the future BIPAM. Further, all RKI research and surveillance activities related to non-communicable diseases, including AI methods development will be transferred into the BIPAM. The RKI responsibilities will solely focus on infectious diseases. According to announced plans of the BMG the primary objective for establishing the BIPAM is to address non-communicable diseases and enhance overall population health. However, the medical specialist training for public health remains non-academic at a state institution. Simultaneously the BMG already replaced two thirds of experts of the permanent commission on vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission, STIKO) and determined new procedures for appointing future expert commissioners. With these changes, Germany embarks on an extraordinary reshuffling of its national public health organizations and responsibilities, by fundamentally separating all issues around non-communicable diseases from those of infectious diseases. Germany\u2019s unraveled research tasks of public health authorities however remains unmet. Thus, 2024 marks a pivotal caesura for public health in the modern history of Germany.\u201d\nSource: Savaskan N, Lampl BMJ, Yavuz M, Tinnemann P. Germany\u2019s national public health gets reorganized: A new institute shall take center stage.\u00a0Health Policy. 2024;145:105084. doi:10.1016/j.healthpol.2024.105084\n\u201cThe German health system and its governance is highly complex. It is the only country in Europe with coexisting SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] and substitutive PHI [Private Health Insurance]. Both schemes are separated along different organizational, regulative and financial lines (Figure 2.1). Care sectors are also separated in terms of organization, governance and financing. Due to separate legislation for individual sectors within public health, ambulatory and inpatient care, as well as in long-term care, there is strong fragmentation of service provision (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).\u201cHealth insurance is compulsory for all citizens and permanent residents, with SHI constituting the main source of financing health care. The multi-payer SHI insurance scheme covered 72.8 million people or 87.7% of the population in 2018. Employees above an opt-out threshold of income, \u20ac 62 550 in 2020, and certain professional groups, e.g. self-employed or civil servants, can opt to enroll in substitutive PHI. Thus, 8.7 million people (or 10.5% of the population) were covered by substitutive PHI (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2019d; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2019b; Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung, 2019a) (see Section 3.3.1 Coverage for more detail). Another unique feature of the German health care system is that the vast majority of providers serve both insured populations. The few exemptions that are accessible only to those insured under substitutive PHI represent less than 1% of total hospitals in 2018 (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2020g).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cHealth insurance coverage is mandatory for the entire population. Coverage is virtually universal and less than 1% of the population is not insured. Some groups of people can choose between publicly financed coverage provided through the statutory health insurance scheme and privately financed substitutive coverage provided by private insurers. Access to substitutive private coverage is restricted to civil servants, self-employed individuals and high-income employees (the annual earnings threshold was \u20ac50,850 in 2012). These groups may opt out of the statutory scheme, but once they do so the return options are limited. For example, employees may only return to the statutory scheme when their earnings fall below the threshold. Individuals with substitutive private coverage who are older than 55 years are prohibited from returning to the statutory scheme.\u201d\nSource: Stefan Gre\u00df. \u201cGermany.\u201d In Voluntary health insurance in Europe: Country experience [Internet].

SHI and PHI (as well as the two long-term care insurance systems) use the same providers\u2014that is, hospitals and physicians treat both statutorily and privately insured patients, unlike those in many other countries.\u201cWithin the legal framework set by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Joint Committee has wide-ranging regulatory power to determine the services to be covered by sickness funds and to set quality measures for providers (see below). To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from health technology assessments and comparative-effectiveness reviews. The Federal Joint Committee is supported by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency (IQWiG), a foundation legally charged with evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drugs with added therapeutic benefits, and the Institute for Quality and Transparency (IQTiG), which is responsible for intersectoral quality assurance. It has 13 voting members: five from the Federal Association of Sickness Funds, two each from the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation, one from the Federal Association of SHI Dentists, and three who are unaffiliated. Five patient representatives have an advisory role but no vote. Representatives of patient organizations have the right to participate in different decision-making bodies\u2014for example, the subcommittees of the Federal Joint Committee.\u201cThe Federal Association of Sickness Funds works with the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation to develop the SHI ambulatory care fee schedule and the DRG catalogue, which are then adopted by bilateral joint committees.\u201d\nSource: Commonwealth Fund.

Its tasks include developing laws and drawing up administrative guidelines for the self-governing activities within the health care system. The Ministry of Health directs a number of institutions and agencies responsible for dealing with higher-level issues of public health, such as the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (\u201cBundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte\u201d \u2013 BfArM) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices makes decisions concerning the approval of pharmaceuticals. The Paul Ehrlich Institute is responsible for approving vaccines.\u201cWhen it comes to matters concerning statutory health insurance, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the highest decision-making body within the self-governing health care system. It includes members representing doctors, dentists, psychotherapists, the statutory insurers, hospitals and patients. As the central entity of federal-level self-governance, the Federal Joint Committee makes decisions concerning which medical services will be covered by the statutory insurers and what form that coverage will take.\u201d\nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

In addition to these four pillar organizations, patient representatives also participate in all sessions; they are entitled to put topics on the agenda, but not to vote.\u201d\nSource: The Federal Joint Committee: Who we are and what we do. Gemeinsame Bundesausschuss (Federal Joint Committee). Last accessed September 30, 2019.\n\u201cThe framework for health care in Germany is based on central decision making:\u201c1) Legislation established by the parliament,\u201c2) Decrees issued by the Ministry of Health,\u201c3) Directives issued by the G-BA under supervision of the ministry, and\u201c4) Contracts between self-governing organizations under supervision of the ministry.\u201cThere is no competition on products on services between the funds. All provide the same services as defined by the G-BA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) or the different umbrella organizations of the SHFs (referred to in the following the Statutory Health Insurer\u2019s organizations (SHIs). Private insurance covers nearly the same services but allows additional benefits (e.g. first class service) \u2013 there is competition between private insurers. Since 2004, decision-making in statutory health insurance has been integrated into a trans-sector federal joint committee that is supported by an independent institute for quality and efficiency in health care, the German IQWiG. Since 2008, according to the new Competition Enhancement Act, the IQWiG has to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of pharmaceuticals in Germany based on international accepted guidelines in evidence based medicine and in health economics.\u201d\nSource: ISPOR\u2014The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research. Global Health Technology Assessment Road Map:  Germany \u2013 Pharmaceutical. Updated June 2009. Last accessed Oct. 2, 2019.\n\u201cThe German health care system is divided into three main areas: outpatient care, inpatient care (the hospital sector), and rehabilitation facilities.\u201cThe institutions responsible for running the health care system include the associations and representatives of various providers and professions, health insurers, regulatory bodies, the Federal Ministry of Health, patient organizations and self-help groups.\u201cThe basic principles of the health care system\u201cThe health care system in Germany is based on four basic principles:\u201cCompulsory insurance: Everyone must have statutory health insurance (\u201cgesetzliche Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 GKV) provided that their gross earnings are under a fixed limit (\u201cVersicherungspflichtgrenze\u201d). Anyone who earns more than that can choose to have private insurance (\u201cprivate Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 PKV).\u201cFunding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.\u201cPrinciple of solidarity: In the German health care system, statutory health insurance members jointly carry the individual risks of the costs of medical care in the event of illness. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care and continued payment of wages when ill \u2013 regardless of their income and premium level. The premiums are based on income. This means that the rich can help the poor, and the healthy can help the ill. However, these premiums are only calculated based on a percentage scale up to a certain income level (\u201cBeitragsbemessungsgrenze\u201d). Anyone earning more than this amount pays the same maximum premium.\u201cPrinciple of self-governance: While the German state sets the conditions for medical care, the further organization and financing of individual medical services is the responsibility of the self-governing bodies within the health care system. These are made up of members representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers and the insured people. The Federal Joint Committee (\u201cGemeinsamer Bundesausschuss\u201d or G-BA \u2013 please also see below: \u201cStructure and institutions of the health care system\u201d) is the highest entity of self-governance within the statutory health insurance system.\u201d \nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

Health insurance is compulsory, but people with an income above a fixed threshold or belonging to a particular professional group (e.g. self-employed people or civil servants) can opt out of SHI coverage and enrol in (substitutive) private health insurance (PHI). About 11 % of the population are covered by PHI; 89 % by SHI. Although coverage is universal for all legal residents and only 0.1 % of the population do not have health insurance, there are still gaps due to financial or administrative barriers (see Section 5.2). The multi-payer SHI system currently consists of 103 sickness funds and 41 PHI companies, and the three biggest sickness funds cover more than one third of the German population.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cIn Germany, 88\u00a0percent of the population is covered by statutory health insurance, which is financed by financially and organizationally independent statutory health insurance funds, and 9\u00a0percent of the population is privately insured.15\u00a0The guiding principle of the German statutory health insurance system is solidarity regarding both income and provision of services: All insured people contribute a share of their income, irrespective of their health risk, and people are entitled to benefits according to their health needs, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, ability to pay, or location.16\u00a0All employed people earning less than the opt-out threshold, people receiving welfare benefits, and pensioners have mandatory statutory health insurance, and their nonearning dependents are insured free of charge. People with high income and self-employed people can purchase private health insurance or keep the statutory health insurance. Coverage of services is roughly the same in both systems, apart from certain newly launched drugs, which are paid for by private insurance. There is no restriction on patients\u2019 choice of hospitals, and patient copays for hospital stays do not differ across hospitals.\u201d\nSource: Esra Eren Bayindir\u00a0and\u00a0Jonas Schrey\u00f6gg. Public Reporting Of Hospital Quality Measures Has Not Led To Overall Quality Improvement: Evidence From Germany. Health Affairs\u00a02023\u00a042:4,\u00a0566-574\n\u201cThe German health system has a complex governance structure. The federal government defines only the legal framework, while regulatory details are specified in directives issued by the Federal Joint Committee \u2013 the highest self-governing decision-making body in the country. The Committee consists of representatives of associations of sickness funds, physicians, dentists and hospitals, as well as three independent members (plus patient representatives without voting rights). It takes decisions on SHI benefits, reimbursement systems and quality assurance.\u201cThe states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) supervise the self-governing bodies at the regional level and are responsible for hospital planning and investments, as well as medical education. They are also responsible for public health services and the running of public health offices, which gained in importance during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the crisis revealed the challenges faced by federal systems in coordinating and managing the pandemic. Governance mechanisms have been put in place to enable rapid, cross-state measures to respond to the crisis through ordinance authorisations, particularly by the Federal Ministry of Health (Box 1).\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cThe German system provides universal population coverage either through social health insurance (SHI) (almost 90% of the population) or substitutive VHI [Voluntary Health Insurance]. As OOP [Out-Of-Pocket] policies of substitutive VHI vary widely (and data is largely unavailable), we focus on SHI. OOP spending in Germany is related to both direct payments for services not covered by SHI (e.g., over-the-counter drugs) and cost-sharing for SHI covered services, but the relative importance of cost-sharing versus direct payments is not known because of the health system\u2019s accounting methods. OOP spending above reference prices for dental care and medical aids can be substantial; for example, reference prices for dental care cover only about 50% of the costs of standard care. Cost-sharing requirements increased in 2004 for such things as prescription drugs, inpatient care, and physician and dental care, while at the same time adult eyeglasses were excluded from coverage. Since these increased requirements became effective in 2004 they do not affect the average growth rate in the 2004\u20132014 period and therefore do not contradict the observed drop in average growth in 2004\u20132014 compared to the 1994\u20132004 period. The most plausible explanation for the low growth in this period is the fact that in 2013, co-payments for physician visits were discontinued. The most important protection mechanism against OOPs is the exemption of children under 18\u00a0years of age and a maximum cost-sharing limit of 2% of annual income (or 1% for patients with severe chronic conditions). This has remained largely unchanged over the study period.\u201d\nRice, Thomas et al. \u201cRevisiting out-of-pocket requirements: trends in spending, financial access barriers, and policy in ten high-income countries.\u201d BMC health services research vol. 18,1 371. 18 May. 2018, doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3185-8.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government recently orchestrated a fundamental change to its public health infrastructure. This reconstruction centers around the founding of a National Institute for Prevention and Education in Medicine (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4vention und Aufkl\u00e4rung in der Medizin, BIPAM) at the cost of two federal institutions, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the Federal Center for Health Education (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, BzGA). Thus, the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, BMG) plans to dissolve the BzGA and integrate its personnel into the future BIPAM. Further, all RKI research and surveillance activities related to non-communicable diseases, including AI methods development will be transferred into the BIPAM. The RKI responsibilities will solely focus on infectious diseases. According to announced plans of the BMG the primary objective for establishing the BIPAM is to address non-communicable diseases and enhance overall population health. However, the medical specialist training for public health remains non-academic at a state institution. Simultaneously the BMG already replaced two thirds of experts of the permanent commission on vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission, STIKO) and determined new procedures for appointing future expert commissioners. With these changes, Germany embarks on an extraordinary reshuffling of its national public health organizations and responsibilities, by fundamentally separating all issues around non-communicable diseases from those of infectious diseases. Germany\u2019s unraveled research tasks of public health authorities however remains unmet. Thus, 2024 marks a pivotal caesura for public health in the modern history of Germany.\u201d\nSource: Savaskan N, Lampl BMJ, Yavuz M, Tinnemann P.

It is the only country in Europe with coexisting SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] and substitutive PHI [Private Health Insurance]. Both schemes are separated along different organizational, regulative and financial lines (Figure 2.1). Care sectors are also separated in terms of organization, governance and financing. Due to separate legislation for individual sectors within public health, ambulatory and inpatient care, as well as in long-term care, there is strong fragmentation of service provision (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).\u201cHealth insurance is compulsory for all citizens and permanent residents, with SHI constituting the main source of financing health care. The multi-payer SHI insurance scheme covered 72.8 million people or 87.7% of the population in 2018. Employees above an opt-out threshold of income, \u20ac 62 550 in 2020, and certain professional groups, e.g. self-employed or civil servants, can opt to enroll in substitutive PHI. Thus, 8.7 million people (or 10.5% of the population) were covered by substitutive PHI (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2019d; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2019b; Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung, 2019a) (see Section 3.3.1 Coverage for more detail). Another unique feature of the German health care system is that the vast majority of providers serve both insured populations. The few exemptions that are accessible only to those insured under substitutive PHI represent less than 1% of total hospitals in 2018 (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2020g).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cHealth insurance coverage is mandatory for the entire population. Coverage is virtually universal and less than 1% of the population is not insured. Some groups of people can choose between publicly financed coverage provided through the statutory health insurance scheme and privately financed substitutive coverage provided by private insurers. Access to substitutive private coverage is restricted to civil servants, self-employed individuals and high-income employees (the annual earnings threshold was \u20ac50,850 in 2012). These groups may opt out of the statutory scheme, but once they do so the return options are limited. For example, employees may only return to the statutory scheme when their earnings fall below the threshold. Individuals with substitutive private coverage who are older than 55 years are prohibited from returning to the statutory scheme.\u201d\nSource: Stefan Gre\u00df. \u201cGermany.\u201d In Voluntary health insurance in Europe: Country experience [Internet].

SHI and PHI (as well as the two long-term care insurance systems) use the same providers\u2014that is, hospitals and physicians treat both statutorily and privately insured patients, unlike those in many other countries.\u201cWithin the legal framework set by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Joint Committee has wide-ranging regulatory power to determine the services to be covered by sickness funds and to set quality measures for providers (see below). To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from health technology assessments and comparative-effectiveness reviews. The Federal Joint Committee is supported by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency (IQWiG), a foundation legally charged with evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drugs with added therapeutic benefits, and the Institute for Quality and Transparency (IQTiG), which is responsible for intersectoral quality assurance. It has 13 voting members: five from the Federal Association of Sickness Funds, two each from the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation, one from the Federal Association of SHI Dentists, and three who are unaffiliated. Five patient representatives have an advisory role but no vote. Representatives of patient organizations have the right to participate in different decision-making bodies\u2014for example, the subcommittees of the Federal Joint Committee.\u201cThe Federal Association of Sickness Funds works with the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation to develop the SHI ambulatory care fee schedule and the DRG catalogue, which are then adopted by bilateral joint committees.\u201d\nSource: Commonwealth Fund.

Its tasks include developing laws and drawing up administrative guidelines for the self-governing activities within the health care system. The Ministry of Health directs a number of institutions and agencies responsible for dealing with higher-level issues of public health, such as the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (\u201cBundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte\u201d \u2013 BfArM) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices makes decisions concerning the approval of pharmaceuticals. The Paul Ehrlich Institute is responsible for approving vaccines.\u201cWhen it comes to matters concerning statutory health insurance, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the highest decision-making body within the self-governing health care system. It includes members representing doctors, dentists, psychotherapists, the statutory insurers, hospitals and patients. As the central entity of federal-level self-governance, the Federal Joint Committee makes decisions concerning which medical services will be covered by the statutory insurers and what form that coverage will take.\u201d\nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

In addition to these four pillar organizations, patient representatives also participate in all sessions; they are entitled to put topics on the agenda, but not to vote.\u201d\nSource: The Federal Joint Committee: Who we are and what we do. Gemeinsame Bundesausschuss (Federal Joint Committee). Last accessed September 30, 2019.\n\u201cThe framework for health care in Germany is based on central decision making:\u201c1) Legislation established by the parliament,\u201c2) Decrees issued by the Ministry of Health,\u201c3) Directives issued by the G-BA under supervision of the ministry, and\u201c4) Contracts between self-governing organizations under supervision of the ministry.\u201cThere is no competition on products on services between the funds. All provide the same services as defined by the G-BA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) or the different umbrella organizations of the SHFs (referred to in the following the Statutory Health Insurer\u2019s organizations (SHIs). Private insurance covers nearly the same services but allows additional benefits (e.g. first class service) \u2013 there is competition between private insurers. Since 2004, decision-making in statutory health insurance has been integrated into a trans-sector federal joint committee that is supported by an independent institute for quality and efficiency in health care, the German IQWiG. Since 2008, according to the new Competition Enhancement Act, the IQWiG has to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of pharmaceuticals in Germany based on international accepted guidelines in evidence based medicine and in health economics.\u201d\nSource: ISPOR\u2014The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.

Last accessed Oct. 2, 2019.\n\u201cThe German health care system is divided into three main areas: outpatient care, inpatient care (the hospital sector), and rehabilitation facilities.\u201cThe institutions responsible for running the health care system include the associations and representatives of various providers and professions, health insurers, regulatory bodies, the Federal Ministry of Health, patient organizations and self-help groups.\u201cThe basic principles of the health care system\u201cThe health care system in Germany is based on four basic principles:\u201cCompulsory insurance: Everyone must have statutory health insurance (\u201cgesetzliche Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 GKV) provided that their gross earnings are under a fixed limit (\u201cVersicherungspflichtgrenze\u201d). Anyone who earns more than that can choose to have private insurance (\u201cprivate Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 PKV).\u201cFunding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.\u201cPrinciple of solidarity: In the German health care system, statutory health insurance members jointly carry the individual risks of the costs of medical care in the event of illness. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care and continued payment of wages when ill \u2013 regardless of their income and premium level. The premiums are based on income. This means that the rich can help the poor, and the healthy can help the ill. However, these premiums are only calculated based on a percentage scale up to a certain income level (\u201cBeitragsbemessungsgrenze\u201d). Anyone earning more than this amount pays the same maximum premium.\u201cPrinciple of self-governance: While the German state sets the conditions for medical care, the further organization and financing of individual medical services is the responsibility of the self-governing bodies within the health care system. These are made up of members representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers and the insured people. The Federal Joint Committee (\u201cGemeinsamer Bundesausschuss\u201d or G-BA \u2013 please also see below: \u201cStructure and institutions of the health care system\u201d) is the highest entity of self-governance within the statutory health insurance system.\u201d \nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

The 2017 reform of LTC increased spending as it expanded the benefits package and increased the number of recipients entitled to LTC services.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cGermany spends a substantial amount of its wealth on health. Total expenditure on health amounted to 11.7% of GDP in 2018 according to data of the Federal Statistical Office. According to WHO data, per capita health expenditure more than doubled between 2000 and 2018, from US$ 2687 (adjusted for differences in purchasing power) to US$ 6098, which ranks Germany third in comparison to other WHO Europe countries in 2018 (after Switzerland and Norway) (World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, 2020) (see Section 3.1 Health expenditure). By OECD data, health expenditure in Germany as a share of GDP was the fourth highest share among OECD countries (after the United States, Switzerland and Norway) and per capita spending was way above the OECD36 average of US$ 3994 in 2018 (OECD, 2019).\u201cPer capita expenditure on health in Germany rose by an average of 2.5% per annum in real terms between 2013 and 2018 (up from 2.1% p.a. between 2008 and 2013). In comparison to other OECD countries, this was a relatively large increase during this period, and higher than in the Netherlands (0.5%), France (0.8%), Austria (1.0%), Switzerland (2.1%) and the OECD36 average (2.4%). According to OECD calculations, average per capita health expenditure growth is projected at 1.9% a year between 2015 and 2030, which would reflect a moderate increase compared to other OECD countries (OECD, 2019). The pace of health expenditure growth is partly attributable to the comparatively large human, technical and infrastructural resources in the German health care system and a high level of activity (e.g. in terms of consultations, hospital cases, consumption of pharmaceuticals). In addition, the full implementation of reforms to the long-term care insurance (LTCI) scheme, such as the broadening of eligibility criteria and benefits, and a rapidly ageing population, represent additional pressures on the sustainability of financing (see Section 5.8 Long-term care).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cCost-sharing and out-of-pocket spending: Out-of-pocket spending accounted for 13.2 percent of total health spending in 2014, mostly on nursing homes, pharmaceuticals, and medical aids.9\u201cCopayments include EUR5.00 to EUR10.00 (USD6.36 to USD12.72) per outpatient prescription, EUR10.00 per inpatient day for hospital and rehabilitation stays (for the first 28 days per year), and EUR5.00 to EUR10.00 for prescribed medical devices. Sickness funds offer selectable tariffs with a range of deductibles and no-claims bonuses. Preventive services do not count toward the deductible. SHI-contracted physicians are not allowed to charge above the fee schedule for services in the SHI benefit catalogue. However, a list of \u201cindividual health services\u201d outside the comprehensive range of SHI coverage may be offered to patients paying out of pocket.\u201cSafety nets: Children under 18 years of age are exempt from cost-sharing. For adults, there is an annual cap on cost-sharing equal to 2 percent of household income; part of a household\u2019s income is excluded from this calculation for additional family members. About 0.3 million of those insured under SHI exceeded the 2 percent cap in 2014 and were exempted from further cost-sharing. The cap is lowered to 1 percent of annual gross income for qualifying chronically ill people; to qualify, those people have to demonstrate that they attended recommended counseling or screening procedures prior to becoming ill. Nearly 6.3 million people, or around 9 percent of all the SHI-insured, benefited from this regulation in 2014.10 Unemployed people contribute to SHI in proportion to their unemployment entitlements. For the long-term unemployed, government contributes on their behalf.\u201d \nSource: Commonwealth Fund. International Health System Profiles: Germany. From the web, last accessed Sept. 30, 2019.\n\u201cAllocative efficiency indicates the extent to which an appropriate mix of services or interventions are purchased to maximize population health outcomes. In Germany the allocation of resources at the federal level mostly reflects the bargaining process between corporatist bodies, rather than a restrictive budget plan. Although there are mechanisms in place to secure the (cost-)effectiveness of benefits covered under SHI using tools such as Health Technology Assessment (see Section 2.7 Regulation), there is no priority setting by e.g. formulating goals. Pooled resources are reallocated among the sickness funds according to a morbidity-based risk-adjustment scheme, by which sickness funds have to cover all costs (see Section 3.3 Overview of the statutory financing system). However, the details of care provision and reimbursement are consequently negotiated between corporatist bodies and are not guided by an overarching strategic programme at the national level (instead, budgets are determined by historic spending levels).\u201cInternational comparisons of health expenditure by function show that Germany spent 27.2% on curative and rehabilitative care in inpatient and day care settings in 2018, which is higher than in the Netherlands (24.4%), Denmark (25.1%) and Switzerland (25.3%), but lower than the EU average (30%), France (31.5%) and Austria (33.3%) (OECD, 2020b). In more detail, Germany spent \u20ac 1169 per inhabitant on hospital care in 2018 (up from \u20ac 691 in 2000), \u20ac 428 on inpatient long-term care (up from \u20ac 211 in 2000) and \u20ac 122 on preventive and rehabilitative institutions (up from \u20ac 92 in 2000).\u201cGermany spent considerably less on ambulatory care than other EU countries. For instance, France (27.2%), Austria (29%), the Netherlands (29.2%), Switzerland (33.4%) and Denmark (34.9%) spent a higher share of health expenditure on ambulatory care, and the EU average is 31.4% (OECD, 2020b). In 2018, \u20ac 662 was spent per inhabitant for ambulatory care practices (up from \u20ac 383 in 2000), \u20ac 330 for dental care practices (up from \u20ac 227), \u20ac 257 for ambulatory long-term care (up from \u20ac 83) and \u20ac 206 on other allied health professionals (up from \u20ac 73).\u201cPharmaceuticals and medical devices accounted for another 13.7% of current health expenditures in 2018 (the fourth highest), according to the Federal Statistical Office. OECD data give a higher estimation for this category, with pharmaceuticals and medical devices representing the third highest budget item (19.3%). Under this data source, comparative countries like France (18.4%), Austria (168%), Switzerland (14.8%) and the Netherlands (11.5%) spent less on pharmaceuticals than Germany, while Denmark (10%) recorded almost half of the German costs (OECD, 2020b).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cA large part of health care expenditure in Germany is derived from the SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] system (see Table 3.2). Contributions to the 105 sickness funds constitute the major system of financing health care. The sickness funds are responsible for collecting contributions, which they transfer to a central reallocation pool known as the Gesundheitsfonds, which is responsible for pooling and reallocating the revenues according to a risk-adjustment mechanism (see Section 3.3.3 Pooling and allocation of funds).\u201cGeneral tax revenue is also used for various purposes in the health care system. All tax-based budgets, at federal as well as state level, are determined by legislatures acting on proposals from their governments. In addition, the Hospital Financing Act stipulates that investment costs should be paid from state taxes as well as by owners of public, private not-for-profit and private for-profit hospitals, if listed in the state\u2019s hospital requirement plan. Therefore, states receive tax money for investments in their hospitals (see Section 3.7.1 Paying for health services).\u201cTaxes as a source of health care financing have decreased throughout the last decade, falling from 10.8% of total health expenditure in 1996 to 4.2% in 2018. The most substantial decrease has been observed in spending on long-term care (about 50%), reflecting the unburdening of municipal budgets after the introduction of statutory long-term care insurance (see Section 5.8 Long-term care). Nevertheless, other spending on investments has decreased as well. Altogether, general government and statutory public sources accounted for 73.5% of current expenditure on health. Private sources accounted for a total 26.5% of total current expenditure: this includes direct out-of-pocket payments made by private households (13.6%). Private insurers financed 8.7%, which includes expenditures for substitutive/comprehensive health insurance, complementary health insurance and long-term care insurance.\u201cIt should be noted that the largest tax-financed item \u2013 the subsidies for SHI \u2013 is not declared as such in the fiscal statistics. Sickness funds receive a fixed amount from the federal budget for several benefits relevant to family policies: maternity benefits, sick-pay for parents caring for sick children, in-vitro fertilization, sterilization for contraceptive purposes, and prescription-only contraception up to the age of 21 and legal abortions. The federal government transfers its subsidy to the central reallocation pool (see Section 3.3.3 Pooling and allocation of funds). In 2012 the federal subsidy was \u20ac 14 billion. In order to consolidate the federal budget, the subsidy was temporarily reduced to \u20ac 10.5 billion in 2013 and \u20ac 11.5 billion in 2015. In 2016 it was again at \u20ac 14 billion and from 2017 it has been set at \u20ac 14.5 billion annually (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2020j). Although these funds come from general taxation, these sums are coded as \u201cstatutory health insurance\u201d in health expenditure statistics.* Figure 3.4 shows the main financial flows between the population, purchasers and health care providers in the German health care system in 2018 \u2013 including public health services and long-term care (except the purchasers and providers mentioned in the footnote).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R.

Revenues and outlays alike increased from 2023 totals: Revenues rose by 11 percent, or $479 billion, and outlays increased by 10 percent, or $617 billion. Revenues in all major categories, but notably individual income taxes, were greater than they were in fiscal year 2023. The largest increase in outlays was for education ($309 billion). Net outlays for interest on the public debt rose by $239\u00a0billion (or 34 percent) to a total of $949 billion. Those amounts differ only slightly from the amounts CBO estimated and discussed in last month\u2019s Monthly Budget Review.\nTable 1.Totals, Fiscal Years 2019 to 2024Billions of Dollars\u00a0201920202021202220232024Receipts3,463\u00a03,421\u00a04,047\u00a04,897\u00a04,439\u00a04,919\u00a0Outlays4,447\u00a06,554\u00a06,822\u00a06,273\u00a06,135\u00a06,752\u00a0Deficit (\u2212)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amount\u2212984\u00a0\u22123,132\u00a0\u22122,775\u00a0\u22121,376\u00a0\u22121,695\u00a0\u22121,833\u00a0\u00a0Percentage of Gross Domestic Product\u22124.6\u00a0\u221214.7\u00a0\u221212.1\u00a0\u22125.4\u00a0\u22126.2\u00a0\u22126.4\u00a0Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury; Office of Management and Budget.\u00a0\nIn 2024, the deficit was equal to 6.4 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), an increase from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2023. The 2024 deficit as a share of GDP is greater than the 50\u2011year average of 3.8 percent and has been exceeded only six times since 1946 (from 2009 through 2012 and in 2020 and 2021). Compared with the size of the economy, federal debt held by the public also increased in 2024\u2014rising to 97.8 percent of GDP from 96.0 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal year 2023.\nOutlays in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 were affected because October 1 (the first day of the fiscal year) fell on a weekend in each of those years. As a result, certain payments were shifted into the prior fiscal year\u2014$64 billion from 2023 into 2022 and $75 billion from 2024 into 2023. If not for those shifts, the deficit in 2024 would have been 13 percent larger\u2014instead of 8 percent larger\u2014than it was in 2023.\nThe 2023 deficit of $1.7 trillion would have been larger if not for the recording of budgetary effects related to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn a plan the Administration announced in 2022 to cancel many borrowers\u2019 outstanding student loans.1 If those effects, and the effects of timing shifts, were excluded for fiscal year 2023, the deficit for that year would have been $2.0\u00a0trillion instead of $1.7 trillion. Thus, without the savings related to the unwinding of the proposed debt cancellation (and excluding the effects of timing shifts in 2023 and 2024), CBO estimates that the\u00a0federal deficit would have been $106 billion smaller in 2024 than in 2023.\nThe deficit in 2024 was $82 billion (or 4 percent), smaller than the shortfall estimated in CBO\u2019s most recent baseline budgetary projections, which were issued in June 2024.2 Revenues were greater than CBO projected in that baseline\u2014by $29 billion (or 1\u00a0percent) and outlays were less than projected, by $53 billion (or 1 percent).\nTotal Receipts: Up by 11 Percent in Fiscal Year 2024\nReceipts totaled $4.9 trillion during fiscal year 2024, CBO estimates\u2014$479 billion more than during fiscal year 2023. Receipts increased from 16.2 percent of GDP in 2023 to 17.1 percent in 2024, just below the average of 17.3 percent for the past 50 years. A portion of that increase is the result of the postponement until fiscal year 2024 of various 2023 tax deadlines for some taxpayers in federally declared disaster areas.\n\nReported receipts from individual income taxes, the largest source of revenue, increased by $250 billion (or 11 percent). Such collections increased from 8.0\u00a0percent of GDP in 2023 to 8.4 percent in 2024, remaining close to the average of 8.0 percent over the past 50 years.\nIndividual income taxes withheld from workers\u2019 paychecks increased by $72 billion (or\u00a04\u00a0percent), reflecting increases in wages and salaries.\nNonwithheld income tax payments increased by $104 billion (or 12\u00a0percent), relative to payments in the same period in fiscal year 2023. That increase includes the effects of delayed payments from taxpayers in areas affected by natural disasters for whom, beginning in February 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) postponed some 2023 filing deadlines. Most of those payments were due by November 2023.\nThe increase in nonwithheld income tax payments would have been even larger were it not for an adjustment of $8.5 billion in fuel tax refunds and credits that were recorded originally in fiscal year 2023. In that year, the IRS reported payments of fuel tax refunds and credits that were not actually paid, incorrectly reducing amounts reported for excise tax collections and increasing amounts reported for collections of individual income taxes. A recertification of the fuel tax credit in July\u00a02024 resulted in an increase in the reported amounts of excise tax collections for that year and a reduction in the amount recorded for collections of individual income taxes. As\u00a0a result, the year-over-year change in individual income taxes was reduced by $17\u00a0billion.\nIndividual income tax refunds declined by $74 billion (or 20 percent), in part because of\u00a0a moratorium placed on new claims for the Employee Retention Tax Credit, which increased individual income tax refunds in\u00a02023. The IRS announced the moratorium in September 2023. In August 2024, the IRS began processing claims while continuing efforts to identify improper and ineligible claims.\n\n\n\nTable 2.Total ReceiptsBillions of DollarsMajor SourceFY\u00a02022FY\u00a02023FY\u00a02024Percentage ChangeFrom 2023 to 2024Individual Income Taxes2,632\u00a02,176\u00a02,426\u00a011.5\u00a0Payroll Taxes1,484\u00a01,614\u00a01,710\u00a05.9\u00a0Corporate Income Taxes425\u00a0420\u00a0530\u00a026.3\u00a0Other Receipts357\u00a0229\u00a0253\u00a010.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total4,897\u00a04,439\u00a04,919\u00a010.8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Percentage of Gross Domestic Product19.2\u00a016.2\u00a017.1\u00a0n.a.\u00a0Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury; Office of Management and BudgetFY = fiscal year; n.a. = not applicable.\u00a0\n\nReceipts recorded from payroll (social insurance) taxes, the second-largest revenue source,\u00a0rose by $95 billion (or 6 percent), remaining at 5.9\u00a0percent of GDP and close to the 6.0\u00a0percent average for the past 50 years. Payroll tax collections typically rise or fall with rising or falling wages and salaries, which constitute the largest part of the payroll tax base. Unemployment insurance receipts (one type of payroll tax) declined by $1 billion (or\u00a02\u00a0percent).\nReceipts from corporate income taxes increased by $110 billion (or 26 percent), from 1.5\u00a0percent of GDP in 2023 to 1.8 percent in 2024\u2014equal to the average of the past 50 years. However, a significant part of that increase was caused by the IRS\u2019s postponement until November 2023 of the deadline for payments that ordinarily would have been due in fiscal year 2023 for many corporations in areas affected by natural disasters, particularly in California.\nReported receipts from other sources rose, on net, by $24 billion (or 11 percent). Most of that increase is the result of the recertification of fuel tax refunds and credits; without that effect, receipts from other sources would have shown an increase of only 3 percent in 2024. Regardless of that timing effect, receipts from other sources remained below 1 percent of GDP and below the 50\u2011year average of 1.5 percent of GDP.\nExcise taxes in 2024 increased by $26 billion (or 34 percent), compared with 2023, largely as a result of the recertification of fuel tax credits.\nRemittances from the Federal Reserve increased by $3 billion, from less than $1 billion in 2023. Those amounts represented significantly less than 0.1 percent of GDP. Those amounts are well below the $107 billion remitted in 2022 and also well below the 50\u2011year average of 0.3 percent of GDP. Since 2022, higher short-term interest rates have raised the central bank\u2019s interest expenses above its income, eliminating the profits of most of the Federal Reserve banks.\nMiscellaneous fees and fines increased by $2 billion (or 4 percent).\nCustoms duties declined by $3 billion (or 4 percent).\nEstate and gift taxes declined by $2 billion (or 6 percent).\n\n\n\nTotal Outlays: Up by 10 Percent in Fiscal Year 2024\nOutlays in fiscal year 2024 were $6.8 trillion\u2014$617 billion (or 10\u00a0percent) more than in 2023. In total, outlays were equal to 23.4 percent of GDP in 2024, down from the recent high of 30.7\u00a0percent in 2020, but still above the 50-year average of 21.1 percent.\nTable 3.Total OutlaysBillions of Dollars\u00a0\u00a0Percentage ChangeFrom 2023 to 2024Major Program or CategoryFY\u00a02022FY 2023FY 2024ActualAdjustedaSocial Security Benefits1,206\u00a01,342\u00a01,448\u00a07.9\u00a07.9\u00a0Medicareb752\u00a0844\u00a0870\u00a03.1\u00a09.4\u00a0Medicaid592\u00a0616\u00a0618\u00a00.3\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00a0Subtotal, Largest MandatorySpending Programs2,550\u00a02,802\u00a02,935\u00a04.8\u00a06.7\u00a0\u00a0Department of Education639\u00a0\u221241\u00a0268\u00a0n.m.\u00a0n.m.\u00a0Veterans Affairs274\u00a0301\u00a0325\u00a08.0\u00a013.8\u00a0Refundable Tax Creditsc292\u00a0171\u00a0199\u00a016.2\u00a016.2\u00a0FDIC\u22129\u00a092\u00a037\u00a0\u221259.5\u00a0\u221259.5\u00a0U.S Coronavirus Refundable Credits29\u00a052\u00a01\u00a0\u221298.5\u00a0\u221298.5\u00a0PBGC2\u00a040\u00a012\u00a0\u221270.2\u00a0\u221270.2\u00a0Food and Nutrition Service192\u00a0171\u00a0147\u00a0\u221214.0\u00a0\u221214.0\u00a0DoD\u2014Militaryd726\u00a0776\u00a0826\u00a06.5\u00a07.2\u00a0Net Interest on the Public Debt534\u00a0710\u00a0949\u00a033.7\u00a033.7\u00a0Other1,044\u00a01,061\u00a01,051\u00a0\u22120.9\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total6,273\u00a06,135\u00a06,752\u00a010.1\u00a011.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Percentage of Gross Domestic Product24.6\u00a022.4\u00a023.4\u00a0n.a.\u00a0n.a.\u00a0Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury; Office of Management and Budget.DoD = Department of Defense; FDIC = Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; FY = fiscal year; PBGC = Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; n.a. = not applicable; n.m. = not meaningful.a.

(The discussion below reflects adjustments to exclude the effects of those timing shifts.)\nIf the 2024 savings related to the unwinding of the proposed cancellation of student loans (discussed below) and the effects of timing shifts are excluded, CBO estimates that outlays in 2024 would have been $373\u00a0billion (or 6\u00a0percent) greater than in 2023.\nOutlays by the Department of Education increased by $309 billion, largely because the Administration recorded a decrease of $330\u00a0billion in August 2023 to reflect the June 2023 Supreme Court decision prohibiting the cancellation of outstanding loans for many borrowers. Excluding the reversal of that proposed debt cancellation, net outlays by the department decreased by $21 billion, primarily because increases in the estimated costs of outstanding loans recorded in fiscal year 2023 were larger than the increases recorded for those costs in 2024. Partly offsetting that decrease, the costs recorded for loans originated in 2024 were higher than the costs of loans originated in 2023. The totals do not include the costs of the debt cancellation policy described in a proposed rule published in April 2024; that rule is currently paused by litigation.\nThe next-largest increase in outlays was for net interest on the public debt. Those outlays rose substantially\u2014increasing by $239\u00a0billion (or\u00a034\u00a0percent)\u2014primarily because interest rates were significantly higher in fiscal year 2024 than they were in fiscal year 2023.\nOutlays for the largest mandatory spending programs increased by $186 billion (or\u00a07\u00a0percent):\n\nSpending for Social Security benefits rose by $106 billion (or 8 percent) because of increases in the average benefit payment (stemming mostly from cost-of-living adjustments) and in the number of beneficiaries.\nMedicare outlays increased, on net, by $78 billion (or 9 percent) because of increased enrollment and higher payment rates for services.\nMedicaid outlays increased by $2 billion (or less than 1 percent) because states have largely completed reassessing the eligibility of enrollees who remained in the program for the duration of the coronavirus public health emergency. (The continuous-enrollment requirement ended on March 31, 2023.) Despite millions of disenrollments during the period in which states reassessed eligibility, Medicaid outlays rose in 2024 because per-person costs for enrollees remaining on Medicaid were greater in 2024 than they were in 2023.\n\nOutlays increased in several other areas:\n\nSpending by the Department of Defense was $56 billion (or 7 percent) greater than in fiscal year 2023; the largest increases were for research and development and operation and maintenance.\nSpending by the Department of Veterans Affairs increased by $41 billion (or 14 percent), mostly because of increased spending per person and veterans\u2019 increased use of health care facilities.\nOutlays for certain refundable tax credits increased by $28 billion (or 16\u00a0percent).3 Those outlays include subsidies for health insurance purchased through the marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act, which were boosted by higher enrollments.\nNet outlays by the Department of Energy (included in \u201cOther\u201d in Table 3) increased by $15\u00a0billion (or 43 percent), primarily because in fiscal year 2023 the Administration sold a substantial amount of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. No such receipts were recorded in 2024. From October 2023 through May 2024, the Administration spent $1 billion to purchase oil to replenish the reserve.\n\nOutlays declined in several areas:\n\nOutlays of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) decreased by $55 billion (or\u00a060\u00a0percent). Outlays in fiscal year 2023 were $92 billion as the FDIC began to resolve two major bank failures that occurred in March 2023. The FDIC\u2019s outlays totaled $37 billion during fiscal year 2024 while that agency continued to resolve those failures along with four more that occurred after March 2023. Starting in June 2024, the FDIC began charging special assessments to recover the losses that resulted from covering uninsured depositors at two of the failed institutions. Over the next decade, the FDIC expects to continue to recover much of the amounts spent by liquidating the failed banks\u2019 assets and by collecting higher premiums from FDIC-insured institutions.\nOutlays related to U.S. Coronavirus Refundable Credits, a group of temporary tax credits to help employers cover the costs of sick and family leave, employee retention, and continuation of health insurance for certain workers, decreased by $51 billion (or 98\u00a0percent). That result is attributable in part to the IRS\u2019s moratorium on processing claims for the Employee Retention Tax Credit.\nNet spending by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation decreased by $28\u00a0billion (or\u00a070\u00a0percent) primarily because of a decline in onetime payments to certain multiemployer pension plans under the Special Financial Assistance Program. Such payments amounted to $15\u00a0billion in fiscal year 2024, compared with $46 billion during 2023.\nSpending by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service decreased by $24\u00a0billion (or 14 percent), in part because emergency allotments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ended in March 2023.\nOutlays from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (also in \u201cOther\u201d) declined by $14 billion (or 50 percent), as expenditures decreased for pandemic-related activities.\n\nEstimated Deficit in October 2024: $255 Billion\nThe federal government incurred a deficit of $255 billion in October 2024, CBO estimates\u2014$189\u00a0billion more than the shortfall recorded last October. Revenues were lower this October (the first month of fiscal year 2025) than a year ago and outlays were higher.\nRevenues in October 2024 were $77 billion less than they were last October, when individual and corporate income taxes had been boosted by deferred payments. Outlays in October 2023 were affected by shifts in the timing of certain federal payments that otherwise would have been due on October 1, which fell on a weekend (those payments were made in September 2023, the last month of fiscal year 2023). If not for those shifts, the increase in outlays in October compared with the same month last year would have been smaller\u2014$39 billion rather than $112 billion. Correspondingly, the increase in the deficit for October also would have been smaller\u2014$116\u00a0billion rather than $189 billion.\nActual Surplus in September 2024: $64 Billion\nThe Treasury Department reported a surplus of $64\u00a0billion for September\u2014$1 billion more than CBO estimated last month, on the basis of the Daily Treasury Statements, in the Monthly Budget Review: September 2024.\nEach month, CBO issues an analysis of federal spending and revenues for the previous month and the fiscal year to date.

      "The Cost of Common Surgeries Compared\nUpdated: 13 September 2024\nAustralia\u2019s healthcare system is divided into two distinct sectors. Private and public. With the public system, public patients are covered by Medicare and often do not have many out-of-pocket fees. The downside to Medicare is that they do not cover every procedure. The private system has more freedom in choice and a faster expectation regarding the surgery date. The downside to this system is that it is often expensive and requires a good health insurance policy that will cover all the associated costs that Medicare cannot.\nKey facts\nCompare Health Insurance Quotes\nProtect what\u2019s most important to you. It\u2019s easy, convenient and free!\nBy clicking \u2018Compare & Save Now\u2019, you are accepting our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and consenting to us contacting you about the products and services provided. Please consider the PDS before purchasing any products.\nUnderstanding Surgery Costs in Australia\nSurgeries are classified into three distinct groups. Urgent, elective and cosmetic.\u00a0Understanding each surgery type will assist you in knowing if your health insurance policy covers it.\u00a0Let\u2019s look closely at these surgery types, the difference between each and why they are necessary.\nMedicare and surgery\nMedicare is free health insurance for all Australian residents. Medicare assists in covering most fees at a public hospital and some at a private hospital.\u00a0Medicare\u00a0does not cover the costs of accommodation and theatre at private hospitals. Private health insurance is important because it creates a safety blanket between you and unforeseen costs. Different health insurance policies are tailored to different requirements. Before any procedure, you must speak to your health insurance provider to\u00a0understand the associated coverage and what out-of-pocket costs can be expected.\nPrivate Surgery and Associated Costs\nPrivate health insurance\u00a0covers any costs that Medicare does not. This may include accommodation, theatre and ambulance costs. Private health insurance offers three packages: Hospital, Extras and Combined. Hospital policies cover costs associated with being a private patient in a private hospital. Extras policies cover out-of-hospital costs that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, as well as ambulance cover for those who live in a state that does not provide ambulance cover. Combined cover is an option that merges both hospital and extras policies. Identifying your personal requirements will assist you in choosing the health insurance policy that meets your needs.\nWhen the costs of your procedure are larger than your policy\u2019s coverage, you will often need to pay for it out-of-pocket or as a copayment. The medical gap scheme assists you in this situation. This is usually a result of specialist fees, bulk billing availability and the services you need. The amount owed is referred to as \u2018the gap\u2019. Most private health insurance providers have policies that include coverage for any gaps that may occur.\u00a0The amount of assistance provided for gap costs varies between health insurance providers.\nAdvantages of private health insurance\nAnalysis of Costs for Top 10 Surgical Procedures\nCataract Surgery\nCataract surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of the eye\u2019s lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.\u00a0The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $2000 in specialist fees and $2400 in hospital fees. Private health insurance will typically cover the full hospital fee, depending on your coverage type.\u00a0\nFor private patients requiring cataract surgery with a glaucoma stent in a private hospital, the average out-of-pocket payment is $490 and $370 for private patients needing general cataract surgery. The average expected costs for uninsured patients can range from $1700 to $2500 per eye. The cost may fluctuate depending on the chosen artificial lens, hospital, and location. Medicare provides cover for this procedure.\u00a0Medicare will pay for 80% of the involved costs, with the patient needing to pay the remaining 20%.\nGastroscopy\nGastroscopy is a procedure that utilises a small and thin flexible tube to examine the upper digestive tract.\u00a0This procedure is used to visualise the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and rule out possible conditions such as peptic ulcers and gastritis. The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $940 for specialist fees and $530 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure receive an average out-of-pocket cost of $140.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $370. This out-of-pocket cost will fluctuate based on your policy. Medicare will pay an average of $420 towards the procedure, with the rest being covered by your private health insurer.\nKnee Replacement\nKnee replacement surgery involves the removal and replacement of diseased, worn-out or damaged knee joint areas.\u00a0The replacement is usually an artificial piece that acts just as a knee joint would and lowers the overall pain a patient may feel while restoring movement to the designated area. The average out-of-pocket cost of this procedure in Australia is around $4,800 for specialist fees and $ 18,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $680.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $3900 but fluctuates based on the chosen policy.\nHeart Angiogram with or without Heart Catheterization\nA heart angiogram is a procedure in which an X-ray is used to view the blood supply to the heart.\u00a0This is to check if the patient has any heart-related issues that need rectifying. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2000 for specialist fees and $ 4,200 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $40.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $490.\nCesarean Section\nA cesarean section, also known as a C-section, is a\u00a0pregnancy-related procedure that allows the baby to be delivered through an incision made on the mother\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0This usually occurs when the healthcare provider believes it is safer for the mother, baby, or both. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 3,500 for specialist fees and $ 7,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $450.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $570.\nCholecystectomy\nA cholecystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a patient\u2019s gallbladder.\u00a0This surgery is often done to remove gallstones and any complications they may cause. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2,800 for specialist fees and $4,500 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $400.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,200.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\nA coronary artery bypass graft is a surgical procedure that improves oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart.\u00a0\u00a0This surgery is usually done to assist with coronary artery disease, which causes a buildup of plaque in the heart\u2019s arteries. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $15000 for specialist fees and $ 35,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $470.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,600.\nHip Replacement Surgery\nA hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which\u00a0damaged, diseased or worn-out hip joint areas are removed and replaced with an artificial piece.\u00a0The artificial piece works in the same manner that a healthy hip joint would and aims to reduce pain in the patient\u2019s hip area while also increasing the area\u2019s mobility. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 5,000 for specialist fees and $ 20,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $690.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 4,000.\nBreast Biopsy\nA breast biopsy is a procedure in which\u00a0a sample of the breast tissue is removed and tested for abnormal cells.\u00a0This test rules out the possibility of breast cancer or any other condition. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 2,400 for specialist fees and $1,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $500.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 100.\nVentral Hernia Repair\nA ventral hernia repair is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an\u00a0incision into the abdomen above the hernia and pushes any protruding intestines back into the abdomen to repair the muscle wall.\u00a0The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 800 for specialist fees and $3 300 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $380.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 1,000.\nCompare common surgeries\nSource: Medical Costs Finder (October 2023; The prices above are estimates for specialists fees; Please refer to your medical professional for an accurate cost estimation)\nHow Private Health Insurance Can Assist with Surgery Costs\nPrivate health insurance is designed to assist patients with any fees that they may have during the course of the necessary procedure.\u00a0Depending on the coverage type, this may include ambulance, extras, and hospital cover.\nThere may be an instance in which the total cost of the procedure is higher than the coverage provided by both Medicare and your Private Health Insurance Provider. Depending on your chosen provider, the policy\u00a0will often provide assistance in the form of gap cover that partially or completely lowers the final amount that you will have to\u00a0pay out-of-pocket.\u00a0The assistance amount will vary based on the provider and policy that you have chosen.\nHow Medicare Works with Private Health Insurance\nMedicare typically covers 75% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for procedures performed in private hospitals, but this doesn\u2019t include hospital accommodation or theater fees. Private health insurance helps cover the remaining costs, but the level of coverage depends on your plan. It\u2019s crucial to understand the limits of your policy, including any gaps you might need to pay out of pocket.\nWhat is the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)?\nThe Medicare Benefits Schedule is a list of medical services covered by Medicare, including surgery, and specifies the amount Medicare will pay for each service. When you have surgery, Medicare covers 75% of the MBS fee, and private health insurance typically covers the rest, though you may still have out-of-pocket costs if your specialist charges more than the MBS fee.\nFrequently Asked Questions and Answers\nThree main types of surgeries could occur. Elective, emergency or cosmetic. Depending on the type of surgery needed, the location, the specialist, and the hospital itself, these factors will increase or decrease the overall cost of surgery in Australia.\nMedicare is a free Health Insurance that is provided to all residents of Australia. It covers the costs associated with public hospitals and most general procedures. Medicare also assists in lowering the total out-of-pocket cost that a patient may need to pay after their procedure.\nTalking to your specialist beforehand will assist you in understanding the costs involved. It is also important to speak with your health insurance provider to ensure that the costs are covered and to verify the estimated amount that may be required.\nPrivate health insurers cover the costs that Medicare does not. For private hospitals, this may include ambulance fees, theatre and accommodation. Each policy is tailor-made to fit specific requirements and as such, there may be certain limitations for each policy type. Understanding these limitations will ensure you are not caught off-guard with unexpected fees and out-of-pocket costs.\nPublic hospitals are often cheaper than private hospitals. The downside to a public hospital is that the wait time is often longer and the patient does not have the option to choose their own specialist. Private hospitals are often more expensive but have faster surgery times and grants the patient the ability to choose their own specialist.\nOther Topics\nFind out more with our useful guides\nHave a question?

The average out-of-pocket cost of this procedure in Australia is around $4,800 for specialist fees and $ 18,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $680.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $3900 but fluctuates based on the chosen policy.\nHeart Angiogram with or without Heart Catheterization\nA heart angiogram is a procedure in which an X-ray is used to view the blood supply to the heart.\u00a0This is to check if the patient has any heart-related issues that need rectifying. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2000 for specialist fees and $ 4,200 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $40.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $490.\nCesarean Section\nA cesarean section, also known as a C-section, is a\u00a0pregnancy-related procedure that allows the baby to be delivered through an incision made on the mother\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0This usually occurs when the healthcare provider believes it is safer for the mother, baby, or both. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 3,500 for specialist fees and $ 7,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $450.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $570.\nCholecystectomy\nA cholecystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a patient\u2019s gallbladder.\u00a0This surgery is often done to remove gallstones and any complications they may cause. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2,800 for specialist fees and $4,500 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $400.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,200.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\nA coronary artery bypass graft is a surgical procedure that improves oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart.\u00a0\u00a0This surgery is usually done to assist with coronary artery disease, which causes a buildup of plaque in the heart\u2019s arteries. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $15000 for specialist fees and $ 35,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $470.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,600.\nHip Replacement Surgery\nA hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which\u00a0damaged, diseased or worn-out hip joint areas are removed and replaced with an artificial piece.\u00a0The artificial piece works in the same manner that a healthy hip joint would and aims to reduce pain in the patient\u2019s hip area while also increasing the area\u2019s mobility. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 5,000 for specialist fees and $ 20,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $690.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 4,000.\nBreast Biopsy\nA breast biopsy is a procedure in which\u00a0a sample of the breast tissue is removed and tested for abnormal cells.\u00a0This test rules out the possibility of breast cancer or any other condition. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 2,400 for specialist fees and $1,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $500.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 100.\nVentral Hernia Repair\nA ventral hernia repair is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an\u00a0incision into the abdomen above the hernia and pushes any protruding intestines back into the abdomen to repair the muscle wall.\u00a0The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 800 for specialist fees and $3 300 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $380.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 1,000.\nCompare common surgeries\nSource: Medical Costs Finder (October 2023; The prices above are estimates for specialists fees; Please refer to your medical professional for an accurate cost estimation)\nHow Private Health Insurance Can Assist with Surgery Costs\nPrivate health insurance is designed to assist patients with any fees that they may have during the course of the necessary procedure.\u00a0Depending on the coverage type, this may include ambulance, extras, and hospital cover.\nThere may be an instance in which the total cost of the procedure is higher than the coverage provided by both Medicare and your Private Health Insurance Provider. Depending on your chosen provider, the policy\u00a0will often provide assistance in the form of gap cover that partially or completely lowers the final amount that you will have to\u00a0pay out-of-pocket.\u00a0The assistance amount will vary based on the provider and policy that you have chosen.\nHow Medicare Works with Private Health Insurance\nMedicare typically covers 75% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for procedures performed in private hospitals, but this doesn\u2019t include hospital accommodation or theater fees. Private health insurance helps cover the remaining costs, but the level of coverage depends on your plan. It\u2019s crucial to understand the limits of your policy, including any gaps you might need to pay out of pocket.\nWhat is the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)?\nThe Medicare Benefits Schedule is a list of medical services covered by Medicare, including surgery, and specifies the amount Medicare will pay for each service. When you have surgery, Medicare covers 75% of the MBS fee, and private health insurance typically covers the rest, though you may still have out-of-pocket costs if your specialist charges more than the MBS fee.\nFrequently Asked Questions and Answers\nThree main types of surgeries could occur. Elective, emergency or cosmetic. Depending on the type of surgery needed, the location, the specialist, and the hospital itself, these factors will increase or decrease the overall cost of surgery in Australia.\nMedicare is a free Health Insurance that is provided to all residents of Australia. It covers the costs associated with public hospitals and most general procedures. Medicare also assists in lowering the total out-of-pocket cost that a patient may need to pay after their procedure.\nTalking to your specialist beforehand will assist you in understanding the costs involved. It is also important to speak with your health insurance provider to ensure that the costs are covered and to verify the estimated amount that may be required.\nPrivate health insurers cover the costs that Medicare does not. For private hospitals, this may include ambulance fees, theatre and accommodation. Each policy is tailor-made to fit specific requirements and as such, there may be certain limitations for each policy type. Understanding these limitations will ensure you are not caught off-guard with unexpected fees and out-of-pocket costs.\nPublic hospitals are often cheaper than private hospitals. The downside to a public hospital is that the wait time is often longer and the patient does not have the option to choose their own specialist. Private hospitals are often more expensive but have faster surgery times and grants the patient the ability to choose their own specialist.\nOther Topics\nFind out more with our useful guides\nHave a question?

Costs for all wound types were determined.\nConclusion The cost of treating wounds in Australia was determined and is anticipated to inform a review of equitable reimbursement of wound treatment costs for Australians with wounds.\nIntroduction\nChronic wounds, or wounds that have failed to heal, are a serious public health issue1,2. In Australia, the economic burden arising from chronic wounds was estimated to be around A$3 billion annually based on 2003\u20132004 and 2010\u20132011 datasets3,4. It is estimated that some 450,000 Australians live with a chronic wound4 which impacts on their explicit and implicit costs and their quality of life and wellbeing1,2,4. Furthermore, the management of acute and chronic wounds presents a significant workload and fiscal burden for Australian hospitals, primary healthcare settings, residential aged care facilities (RACFs) and community health services1\u20135. Yet actual data, which is important for planning, budgeting and resourcing purposes, and which informs national benchmarking and activity-based funding6, is limited across all Australian health sectors. More importantly, there is inequitable access to evidence-based wound management services and contemporary treatment consumables for all Australians1,2,4.\nIn response to these challenges the Australian Health Research Alliance (AHRA), which is comprised of 10 National Health and Medical Research Centre-accredited research translation centres across Australia developed and implemented a National Wounds Initiative which comprised four projects:\nCollectively, these four projects aimed to promote a nationally consistent and effective approach to wound care. The initiative was co-led for the AHRA by the Western Australian Health Translation Network (WAHTN) and Health Translation Queensland (HTQ).\nIn developing this National Wounds Initiative, an extensive literature review was undertaken which considered the recommendations and outcomes produced in some key literature such as: the Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation\u2019s Chronic wounds in Australia: an issues paper1; Pacella et\u00a0al\u2019s Solutions to the chronic wounds problems in Australia: a call to action2; the Australian Government\u2019s 2019 Wounds management pilot grant opportunity7; and the Medicare Benefits Schedule Review Taskforce\u2019s Wound Management Working Group Taskforce findings8. In addition, the AHRA hosted a workshop in Brisbane, Queensland which brought together 32 clinical experts, researchers and representatives from the AHRA and Wounds Australia to determine the wound-related research priorities and strategies.\nThis paper reports on the methodology and outcomes for Project\u00a01: Determining the actual cost of wound care, which aimed to determine the number and type of wounds and their treatment costs (consumables and labour) in Australian hospitals, RACFs, general practices (GPs) and community providers, and to provide evidence to inform reimbursement of wound treatment costs for all Australians. This would do much to ensure access to best practice treatments and a consistent standard of wound care for all Australians. This project was initiated and led by WAHTN in partnership with HTQ and in collaboration with the Silver Chain Group Inc (Silverchain), a large Australian community care provider.\nMethodology\nExpressions of interest to participate were sought from the Western Australian (WA) and Queensland (QLD) Health Departments, public hospitals and RACF administrators and GP directors. Unfortunately, the COVID pandemic and associated staffing and access restrictions limited the number of participating facilities and areas. However, two tertiary hospitals (one in WA with 600 beds and the other in QLD with 1,308 beds), one secondary care hospital in WA (290 beds), three WA RACFs (207 beds) and four GPs (two in WA and two in QLD) participated. Approval to conduct the study was obtained from the relevant Human Research Ethics Committees and site-specific Governance Committees.\nData recorded in Silver Chain Group\u2019s (community care provider hereafter) electronic wound module at the point-of-care in 2020/2021 were analysed. They comprised 21,189 clients with 49,234 wounds treated by nurses from this community care provider in WA, QLD and South Australia (SA). The scope included all wounds treated during 2020/2021 irrespective of whether they were healed or discharged unhealed during the year or had ongoing care beyond 2020/2021. A total of 445,400 client visits for wound treatments were recorded. For each of these visits, the following details were collected: the date, the visit duration, the category and type of wound/s treated, and consumables used excluding Goods and Services Tax. The contemporary wound treatment consumables used (dressing packs, solutions, dressings, devices, instruments, bandages/wraps) were provided at no cost to clients by the community care provider.\nEmbedded in the electronic wound module was the cost of these wound consumables, which were automatically allocated to each electronic care plan for each wound treatment performed. These records were linked with details about the attending nurse time spent undertaking each procedure, and labour costs were calculated using the actual direct time taken to perform the wound treatments by each attending community nurse and multiplied by their pay rates. Other indirect costs such as travel and organisational overheads were excluded, as these would have differed across the various health settings.\nIf client visits involved the treatment of multiple wounds, the cost of consumables was ascertained from each care plan for each wound. The labour cost for treating multiple wounds on the same client at the same visit was estimated based on the mean and median time taken to treat the collective different wound types. Since every wound treated had a unique identifier in the wound module database, all the costs of managing a wound across numerous client visits was consolidated into a single total cost to manage each wound treated during 2020/2021.\nAll of the wounds recorded in the wound module were catalogued into wound categories and wound types, the latter being subdivisions of each of the former. The wound categories were acute wounds, amputations, foot ulcers, leg ulcers, pressure injuries, skin tears and tumours and other wounds (primarily open dermatological wounds or abrasions). Although skin tears are in effect acute wounds, they were categorised separately, because skin tears comprised a large cohort of wounds in the community provider\u2019s data for elderly clients9.\nThe client outcomes identified in this same dataset, and reported separately, demonstrated 80% of wounds healed or were discharged to self-care (virtually healed and usually required the client to remove the final protective dressing), during the study period9.\nThe cost to treat the hospital, GP and RACF wounds was estimated by using the mean and median costs for the same wound type as identified in the community care provider 2020/2021 dataset. The rationale for this modelling was that it standardised the cost of wounds to treat across the cohorts and it took into account that many hospital patients are discharged prior to complete wound healing. Therefore, the cost for each study wound type was estimated based on the mean and median costs to treat different wound types in the community care provider\u2019s dataset 2020/2021 for 21,189 clients with 49,234 wounds. The assumption was that the same wound type across the four cohorts would have had similar treatments and all healthcare providers (primarily nurses) would have taken similar times to perform the treatments, and would have used similar consumables (dressing packs, instruments, solutions, dressings, devices, bandages/wraps).\nIn order to determine if this modelling was reasonable, a review of wound costing methods literature was conducted using Medline and Onesearch, with three relevant articles identified10\u201312. The project methodological design and data collection methods were reviewed in light of the literature to confirm that:\nData was then collected during the surveys conducted in WA hospitals, GPs and RACFs on electronic tablets using Qualtrics\u00ae software between 14 December 2020 and 20 August 2021. In Queensland, survey data was collected between 19 May 2021 and 15 October 2021 using hospital survey software or Qualtrics\u00ae for GPs. A 1-day representative survey sample of data for 30 June 2021 was obtained from the community care provider.\nThe following protocol was adopted to carry out the wound surveys in the hospitals and RACFs:\nAs the number of patients who visited a GP with a wound on a daily basis was considered to be low, the following process was adopted to facilitate data collection in the GPs:\nA representative sample of 1 day of community clients who had wound care on 30 June 2021 was obtained from the community care provider and underwent the same costing analysis as the other three cohorts. All statistical analysis was conducted using R (version 4.2.1) with descriptive statistics reported as counts or proportions of the total cohort. Chi-squared tests of proportion were used to determine differences between gender proportions between settings.\nResults\nThe characteristics of each individual and each wound recorded in the respective surveys across each of the four cohorts are summarised in Table\u00a01. Overall, there were 2,505 patients/residents/clients with 3,096 wounds. The relatively low numbers of hospital patients with wounds was influenced by COVID\u201119 access restrictions in some hospital areas. In addition, written consent was required for hospital patients; a large proportion of these were either too ill or cognitively unable to provide written consent, whilst some declined.\nThe four cohorts differed in both demographics such as age and also in wound categories and type of wounds. The median age of individuals in the hospitals, RACFs, GPs and community provider cohorts was 64\u00a0years, 82\u00a0years, 67\u00a0years and 69.5\u00a0years respectively. However, it is to be noted that no paediatric hospital was surveyed. As expected, the RACFs generally cared for older patients as compared to hospitals and GPs. There was an observed difference in the percentage of males between cohorts (\u03c72(3)=18.8, p=0.0003). The GPs treated more females with wounds than males (\u03c72(1)=4.20, 95% CI [0.33, 0.50], p=0.040) and the community care provider treated more males with wounds than females (\u03c72(1)=30.3, 95% CI [0.55, 0.60], p<0.0001).\n\u00a0\n\n\n* Includes some patients/residents/clients treated for multiple wounds\n\u00a0\nOverall, acute wounds were the most common (34.01%), followed by leg ulcers (17.70%), \u2018other wounds\u2019 (13.27%), foot ulcers (11.92%), pressure injuries (9.95%), skin tears (8.14%), and tumours (2.94%). In the hospital cohort, there were 816 patients with 748 wounds, mostly acute wounds (56.82%, including amputations) due to surgical or traumatic aetiologies. The RACF cohort treated 205 residents with 99 wounds, mostly \u2018other wounds\u2019 (34.34%), skin tears (28.28%) and pressure injuries (8.8%). The GP cohort treated 137 patients with 181 wounds, mostly acute wounds (49.72%), leg ulcers (21.55%) and skin tears (11.05%). The community care provider treated 1,347 clients with 2,068 wounds, mostly acute wounds (28.85%, including amputations), leg ulcers (23.74%) and foot ulcers (16.73%).\nEstimates using both the mean and the median costs associated with treating wounds in all four cohorts are shown in Table\u00a02. The distribution of costs was heavily right skewed. While the median is more robust against outliers than the mean, the mean better reflects the real costs expended in clinical practice. There were a significant number of \u2018other wound\u2019 types whose costs could not be estimated because insufficient numbers of these wound types were recorded in the community care provider dataset. Also, some \u2018other wound\u2019 types such as incontinence-associated dermatitis that were identified in the hospital and RACF cohorts were not specifically recorded in the community care provider dataset. Different categorisation schema may also have contributed to low numbers of certain wound types. The wound categories that conveyed the costliest burdens were acute wounds followed by leg ulcers and pressure injuries.\nTable\u00a02 summarises the estimated costs of wounds in the four cohorts, including the standard error (SE) in each estimate. Estimates\u00a0A and B indicate the estimated costs of wound treatment for each wound type based on the mean or median costs, respectively, as extrapolated from the community care provider\u2019s costs in 2020/2021. For example, Estimate\u00a0A for the consumables cost for treating the 95 abscesses observed during this survey was A$16,841\u00b1804, calculated by multiplying 95 by the mean cost of consumables incurred by the community care provider in treating abscesses in 2020/2021. Estimate\u00a0B of the labour cost for the same 95 abscesses was A$17,773\u00b1820, calculated by multiplying 95 by the median cost. Lastly, estimates of the total treatment cost are the sum of the consumables and labour costs.\n\u00a0\nTable 2. Consumables and direct labour costs for wounds across the four cohorts* as estimated using the mean (Estimate A) or median (Estimate B) costs identified in the community provider\u2019s dataset for 2020/2021\n\n\n\n* Four care settings combined: residential aged care, hospital, general practice, and community. Excluded any indirect costs such as organisational overheads, management, administration, travel, systems, training that were additional to direct client contact, and business overheads such as rent, utilities, insurances, vehicles, maintenance and repairs. Consumable costs excluded the goods and services tax.\n\u2020 These wounds were excluded from cost analysis since there were no comparator wounds in the community care provider dataset.\n\u00a0\nDiscussion\nEvaluation of the data collection methods across each site and cost modelling, which was conducted using a modified bottom-up costing method based on the Independent Hospital and Aged Care Pricing Authority (IHACPA) methodology, proved robust15. The results provided valuable insight into the number and type of wounds across a sample of Australian hospitals, RACFs, GPs and a community care provider. Although it was anticipated that hospitals would have a higher number of acute wounds, it was noteworthy that acute wounds also comprised the greater number of wounds managed by GPs and the community care provider. Similar findings were found in a community cross-sectional study conducted in North America16, as well as in a cross-sectional study conducted amongst 18 GPs in Queensland in 2011, which demonstrated 81.5% of the wounds resulted from surgery or trauma17.\nSkin tears, which are common wounds found amongst the elderly, comprised 28.28% of the RACF wounds18,19. They also comprised 12.97% of hospital wounds which was slightly more than the WoundsWest findings obtained from surveys which were conducted across all 86 public hospitals in WA in 2008, 2009, 2011, and which found skin tears to be 11%, 9% and 9.6% respectively20,21. Pressure injuries on the other hand were found to range from 4% in GPs, 9% in RACFs and hospitals, and 10% in the community cohort. Nghiem et\u00a0al22 reported 12.9% of pressure injuries cost Australian public hospitals A$9.11\u00a0billion (95% confidence intervals (CI): 9.02, 9.21) in 2020 and treatment costs attributed to A$3.59\u00a0billion (CI: 3.57, 3.60) of these costs. Whilst there appears to be a dearth of data concerning pressure injuries managed by GPs, Wilson et\u00a0al23 reported projected costs of A$98,489 to care for 20 residents with 23 pressure injuries. However, these modelled costs included wound treatments, pressure off-loading devices, nutritional supplements and labour, whereas the median cost (consumables and labour) to treat pressure injuries in a community cohort in 2020/2021 was A$150.56 (interquartile range: A$71.85\u2013391.12)9. Pressure injuries are costly, and they are considered to be largely preventable wounds; the implementation of preventative strategies is therefore a fundamental tenet of the Australian Commission for Safety and Quality in Health Care Standards24.\nThe Australian Medical Association25 reported challenges in gauging the extent of GP and community wound care costs, although a study in the UK found 81% of total wound care costs to the National Health Scheme were incurred in the community sector26. Access to rigorous data from diverse community healthcare providers in Australia is complicated by the number and variety of community healthcare providers and the potential for duplication of services. An Australian study conducted in Queensland found patients with leg ulcers reported a median of three (range two to seven) healthcare provider organisations involved in their care27. Fortunately, the community care provider whose data was used to determine costs in this study has an enviable and rigorous electronic system for recording wound data at point of care and a commitment to monitoring data entry9.\nAdherence to the principle that wound care should be provided at the lowest appropriate cost without compromising best practice28 is challenged by inequitable access to contemporary wound consumables across Australia1,2. Furthermore, some researchers have employed a top-down costing model using hospital estimated costs4, or in other settings modelled costs for inclusion of adjuvant therapies such as nutritional supplements or pressure off-loading devices5. Although the IHACPA approach uses a bottom-up model for costing direct labour time and therapeutic goods specific to the patient and the diagnosis, they also include additional cost buckets for recurrent costs such as hotel costs, procedure and imaging costs, staff salaries with on-costs and depreciation15.\nHowever, the researchers involved in this study chose to report only actual costs for treatment consumables and direct labour costs to perform the wound treatments in order to provide a more transparent insight into the direct costs of wound care. It was acknowledged that many other costs associated with the delivery of care are covered within alternative funding arrangements of the treating organisation. Nor did the researchers explore additional costs that may have been placed on patients/residents/clients, although these additional costs should be investigated by subsequent research.\nAs outlined, a strength of this study was the use of actual costs made possible by the fact that contemporary treatment consumables were provided at no cost to the community care provider\u2019s clients, and it was these data that were used to model the costs of wound treatments across the four study cohorts. However, treatment costs varied significantly between and within the study wound types due to the variations between the estimates for each wound type (Table\u00a02). This variation emphasises that a standardised average reimbursement price for wound care across all wound types is not feasible. However, determining the cost of reimbursement other than for labour and consumables for each wound type was outside the scope of this study.\nThe wound types associated with highest estimated costs in this study were suture lines, open incisional wounds and venous leg ulcers. The findings for incisional wounds were similar to a review of 2014 data from US Medicare beneficiaries which found surgical wounds and infections were the costliest items, noting that the highest costs were incurred in outpatient settings29. In an earlier study, Fife et\u00a0al30 reported a mean cost to heal per wound of US$3,927, and also noted wide variation in costs for complex wounds such as flaps or grafts which had a mean cost to heal of US$9,358. Guest et\u00a0al31 examined a sample of 2,000 patients which comprised 40% acute wounds, 48% chronic wounds and 12% an unknown diagnosis in the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) and calculated costs of \u00a3698\u20133,998 for healed wounds, and \u00a31,719\u20135,976 for unhealed wounds. The wide variations in costs were again similar to those found in this study.\nPhillips et\u00a0al32 reported that leg and foot ulcers, pressure injuries and postoperative wounds accounted for most of the wound care costs in GP in Wales in 2012/2013, with average costs of \u00a31,727 per patients (for up to 6\u00a0months follow-up). Costs were associated with GP visits, district nurse home visits, outpatient and inpatient care32. Potentially some of these associated costs would have been covered by other NHS funding arrangements, and conglomerate healthcare costs make for difficult comparisons of actual wound treatment costs (consumables and labour). Furthermore, they can negatively influence the argument for national reimbursement of wound consumables.\nNotwithstanding, it is difficult to compare costs across studies as there is inconsistency in methods of cost evaluation, that is discrepancies in use of direct and indirect costs, duration of data collection and outcomes measured. Romanelli et\u00a0al33 reported standard care direct costs were US$2,540 for venous leg ulcers during an 8-week trial in an outpatient setting. While Urwin et\u00a0al34 reported an average 2-week cost per person of \u00a3166.39 (95% CI: 157.78\u2013175.00), with an estimated annual cost per person of \u00a34,585.70 using data from a survey of nine UK NHS community health services in 2015/2016. More recently, venous leg ulcers were demonstrated to be a common wound in an Australian community cohort, with a median cost to treat (consumables and direct labour) of A$495 (range A$198\u20131,162)9.\nConsidering venous leg ulcers are estimated to affect over 300,000 mainly older Australians, and with anticipated increases in the ageing population35 and reports of lengthy healing times and recurrence rates of up to 78%35,36, it would appear feasible and prove cost-effective to fund preventive treatments. Compression therapy in the form of bandages, hosiery or wraps is considered the \u2018gold\u2019 standard treatment for venous leg ulcers34\u201336. However, there is currently no Australian reimbursement scheme for dressings or compression therapies for all Australians. Cheng et\u00a0al35 determined reimbursement of compression therapy for the treatment of venous leg ulcers would cost the Australian health system an additional A$270 million over 5\u00a0years, which they proposed would be substantially offset by anticipated A$1.4 billion in cost savings.\nIn accordance with the results from this study, the researchers debated three options for an Australian Health System reimbursement of wound treatment (product, labour) services and products:\nThe researchers would recommend the last option as it is considered to be more feasible for ensuring equitable access to wound care services and products for all Australians.\nAs previously highlighted, a strength of this study was the use of data for actual wound treatment consumables and direct labour costs for performing the wound dressing procedures. The fact that the consumables were supplied at no charge to clients with wounds recorded in the community care provider dataset, and these data were used to model the costs across the four cohorts, allowed for standardised comparisons.\nA limitation relates to the fact that the community care provider has the capacity to bulk purchase consumables yet these associated cost benefits may not be available to smaller providers. Furthermore, these costs reflect 2020/2021 costs for labour and consumables, and variations in exchange rates and procurement may lead to associated cost increases over time. The community provider labour costs were determined based on nurse salary levels; it could be assumed that health professionals other than nurses may perform the wound dressing procedures in other health settings and therefore this may lead to associated cost differences. Additional limitations were access restrictions associated with the management of the COVID\u201119 pandemic which limited the capacity to survey all wards in the tertiary hospitals and conduct surveys in more health settings, particularly regional hospitals, remote communities and a more diverse range of GPs across all Australian states and territories.\nConclusion\nThis study sought to determine the number and type of wounds and their treatment costs (consumables and labour) in a sample of Australian hospitals, RACFs, GPs and community care providers and provide evidence to inform reimbursement of wound treatment costs for all Australians. Ultimately, every Australian with a wound should expect the same standard of care regardless of their geographic location, type of wound and healthcare provider. The researchers are strongly convinced that best practice wound prevention and management would lead to optimal healing outcomes if services and practitioners who adhere to this thesis and implemented national standards were reimbursed the mean cost of wound treatments and, if not covered by other funding arrangements, the mean cost of direct labour for performing the treatment procedures.\nAcknowledgements\nThe researchers gratefully acknowledge the support of the administrators and staff of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Armadale Hospital, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Third Avenue Surgery, Illawarra Medical Centre, Salisbury Medical Centre, Inala Primary Care, Hall and Prior Aged Care Homes (Belmont, Leighton and Karingal Green), School of Nursing QUT, Silver Chain Group Inc., The University of Western Australia, Queensland University of Technology, Curtin University, University of Notre Dame Australia and all of the surveyors.\nAuthor contribution\nJo Wilkie was involved in the conception, design, acquisition, analysis and interpretation of the data, as well as final approval of the version of the paper to be published.

Some commentators point to widespread supply bottlenecks and adverse geo-political events that caused significant disruption to the production and availability of manufactured goods. Others argue that significant shifts in aggregate demand for manufactured goods were the leading factors underlying these observed price fluctuations, and cite shifts in consumer preferences, unprecedented discretionary fiscal policy, and a change in the monetary policy stance following the pandemic.\nIn this note, we provide new evidence to the debate of how much of the recent run-up and retreat of producer price inflation is driven by supply versus demand factors, which is part of an ongoing area of research that has seen recent contributions by e.g. Shapiro (2022), Benigno and Eggertsson (2023), Kabaca and Tuzcuoglu (2023), Bai, Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde, Li and Zanetti (2024) among others. Quantifying the relative effects of supply and demand shocks is critical to understanding movements in inflation and, thus, to informing appropriate policy responses to changes in inflation.\nFigure 1 (top panel) shows the year-on-year (YoY) inflation rate based on the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) of manufactured goods published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. After a brief decline during the height of the pandemic, prices climbed rapidly in subsequent months, reaching rates above 18%, the highest recorded values since the start of the index in 1987. Then, in 2023, manufacturing producer prices suddenly levelled off, with a rapid decline in the rate of inflation to levels near zero.\nHow much of these fluctuations can be attributed to supply and demand factors? Answering this question has proved very difficult not only because of the complexity of the post-pandemic period, but also because many of the observed outcomes could be consistent with either changes in supply or demand conditions. For new evidence on this topic, we leverage data from the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity (QPC), a U.S. Census Bureau data product primarily designed to gauge capacity and utilization rates in the manufacturing sector.\nThe survey asks establishments to report their full production capabilities (capacity) as well as their operating rate, with plants operating at less than full capacity further asked to identify the reasons. As shown in Figure 1 (bottom left), in normal times the vast majority of establishments cite lack of demand (or, \"insufficient orders\") as the reason for operating at less than capacity. During the pandemic, this share dropped notably, with the fraction of plants citing \"insufficient orders\" reaching an all-time low of just 48.3% in the first quarter of 2022. On the other hand, Figure 1 (bottom right) also shows a spike of manufacturing establishments citing \"insufficient supply of materials\" during the pandemic, with this fraction reaching an all-time high of 42.7% of firms in the fourth quarter of 2021. Both of these spikes in establishment responses have since largely, though not completely, unwound to more typical levels. Taken together, the evidence from the QPC suggests both supply and demand as being important drivers of producer prices over the last few years.\nThe QPC is a useful resource for gauging demand and supply conditions together in one survey. Moreover, the QPC measure of supply bottlenecks is ideal in that it captures the extent to which a firm is constrained from producing a desired quantity. However, the published QPC data only report the share of respondents citing a certain explanation, which has drawbacks in quantifying structural supply and demand factors underlying the manufacturing PPI. Furthermore, even if used as direct explanatory variables for PPI inflation, their high mutual correlation would make it difficult to disentangle their individual contributions.\nNote: Shaded areas indicate periods of recessions as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research where appropriate: March 2001\u2013November 2001, December 2007\u2013June 2009 and February 2020\u2013April 2020.\nSources: Top panel: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Bottom panel: U.S. Census Bureau Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity (Disclosure Review Board (DRB) approval number: CBDRB\u2011FY23\u20110231).\nAccessible version\nIn this FEDS note, we argue for an approach that combines insights from the QPC survey data with bivariate industry-level structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models for industrial production (quantities) and producer prices. These are simple models designed to disentangle producer price fluctuations into supply and demand factors. We then relate these models to industry-level estimates of demand and supply constraints from the QPC survey data to obtain sharper identification. After decomposing changes in PPI into supply and demand factors at a granular level, we then aggregate to obtain a decomposition for the entire manufacturing sector.\nFor our exercise, we collect data at the 3-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) level for industrial production (IP) and producer price indexes, and match those with shares of establishments reporting either insufficient materials or insufficient demand in the QPC data. After extending PPI indexes back in time, the result is monthly data on IP and PPI from 1978 to December 2023, for a total of 18 industries1, and quarterly QPC survey data going back to 2008.\nIn the following, we denote by $$ q_{it} $$ and $$ p_{it} $$ the monthly percentage changes in industry i's industrial production and producer price index, respectively. We consider bivariate industry-level structural VAR (SVAR) models of the form:\n$$$$ q_{it} = \\alpha_i p_{it} + c_{1i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{qq} q_{i,t-j} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{qp} p_{i,t-j} + \\epsilon_{it}^s , \\\\ $$$$\n$$$$ q_{it} = \\beta_i p_{it} + c_{2i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{pq} q_{i,t-j} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{pp} p_{i,t-j} + \\epsilon_{it}^d , $$$$\nwhere the first equation is the supply equation perturbed by supply shocks $$ \\epsilon_{it}^s $$, with $$ \\alpha_i $$ measuring industry i's short-run price elasticity of supply. The second equation represents the demand equation, where $$ \\epsilon_{it}^d $$ are demand shocks and $$ \\beta_i $$ measures the short-run price elasticity of demand. The rest of the coefficients are meant to capture the joint-dynamics of IP and PPI around their average growth rate.\nWithout further assumptions, the bivariate system of equations is not identified, yielding many constellations of $$ \\alpha_i $$ and $$ \\beta_i $$ equally consistent with the data (for a discussion, see e.g., Kilian and L\u00fctkepohl (2017)). To achieve identification, we impose a series of identifying constraints. First, we assume conventional sign restrictions on the short run price elasticities. This includes that the supply curve is upward sloping ($$ \\alpha_i > 0 $$ ), while the demand curve is downward sloping ($$ \\beta_i < 0 $$ ). Second, we postulate that quarterly averages of structural supply and demand shocks should be highly correlated with the change in the QPC survey measure for establishments citing insufficient materials and insufficient demand, respectively.2 Once the model is identified, it is possible to decompose industry i's PPI growth through the lenses of the estimated SVARs as:\n$$$$ p_{it} = \\mu_i + p_{it}^d + p_{it}^s $$$$\nwhere $$\\mu_i $$ is the average growth rate of industry i's PPI index, the term $$p_{it}^s $$ is the variation that can be accounted for by supply shocks, and the term $$ p_{it}^d $$ is the variation driven by demand shocks. Finally, an approximate decomposition of the aggregate PPI's monthly percentage increase $$ p_t $$ is then given by:\n$$$$ p_{t} = \\underbrace{\\sum_i w_{i,t} \\mu_i}_{\\text{deterministic components}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_i w_{i,t} p_{it}^s}_{\\text{supply factors}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_i w_{i,t} p_{it}^d}_{\\text{demand factors}} $$$$\nwhere $$w_{i,t} $$ are industry relative importance weights available from the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production G.17 statistical release.3\nThis methodology is related to the recent work by Shapiro (2022), which disentangles the supply and demand factors driving the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index by leveraging joint fluctuations in quantity and price data of individual PCE goods and services categories. For each month, a category's PCE growth rate is allocated to either the supply or demand component based on sign restrictions equivalent to what we use in our industry level SVARs. We refine this approach by sharpening the identification strategy, i.e. leveraging the additional survey data that is unique to the manufacturing sector. In addition, our approach allows us to decompose each industry's monthly variation into a mix of both demand and supply factors, and historical realizations thereof, instead of only estimating their net effect, as in Shapiro (2022).\nBefore discussing the results of our decomposition, we first conduct an exercise to test the ex-post validity of our methodology. Following Shapiro (2022), we study the dynamic response of the estimated PPI demand and supply factors to well-understood macroeconomic shocks. Specifically, we estimate empirical impulse response functions (IRF) to a monetary policy shock as in Bauer and Swanson (2023), and oil supply shocks as in Kanzig (2021).4 For a credible decomposition, only the demand component of the PPI should respond to a monetary policy shock, and only the supply component to an oil supply shock.\nFigure 2 shows estimates of these IRFs to a monetary policy shock, normalized to increase the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points (top panel), and an oil supply shock normalized to increase the real oil price by 10% (bottom panel). The solid lines show the dynamics of producer prices in percentage deviations from trend, with dashed and dotted lines indicating estimation uncertainty at the 68% confidence interval coming from two econometric procedures.5 As we expect, the demand-driven level of producer prices is estimated to decrease in response to a 25bp tightening in monetary policy, peaking at about -0.5 percent after 18 months. On the other hand, the dynamic effect on the supply factor remains small and is statistically insignificant. Similarly, in the IRFs to a cost-pushing oil supply shock normalized to increase oil prices by 10%, we find strong reactions in supply driven factors, which peak rapidly at around 0.7 percent after 8 months. The demand component is estimated to decrease slightly but remains insignificant.\nThese IRF results validate that the supply and demand shocks we identify act as intended in disentangling the supply and demand driven fluctuations in the producer price index of manufactured goods.6 Next, we show the role these supply and demand factors have played in the evolution of the manufacturing PPI since 2007.\nNote: The solid lines show the dynamics of producer prices in percentage deviations from trend, with dashed and dotted lines indicating estimation uncertainty at the 68% confidence interval. The dashed line corresponds to confidence intervals computed by the block bootstrap of Jentsch and Lunsford (2022), while the dotted line corresponds to weak-identification robust confidence set by Montiel Olea, Stock and Watson (2021).\nAccessible version\nFigure 3 plots the estimated decomposition of the year-on-year PPI inflation rate (black line), adjusted for the deterministic terms. The beige bars capture the fluctuations that are attributed to supply shocks, while the red bars capture demand factors. The gray shaded areas correspond to recessions as reported by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\nNote: Shaded areas indicate periods of recessions as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research: December 2007\u2013June 2009 and February 2020\u2013April 2020.\nAccessible version\nWe focus our discussion of this decomposition on the period of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) as well as the COVID and post-Covid inflation surge more recently.\nGreat Financial Crisis\nThe increase in prices at the onset of the Great Financial Crisis has been well documented. Hamilton (2009) discusses in detail the demand and supply factors leading to the oil price shock in 2007-2008 which contributed significantly to the increase in goods prices. Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (2008) highlight the surge in commodity (in particular oil) prices during the early part of the GFC. The Caballero et al. (2008) model alongside the evidence put forward by Christiano, Eichenbaum, Trabandt (2015) and Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim, Zakrajsek (2017), argues that the main reason for the commodity price volatility and other \"missing disinflation/deflation\" during this time was ultimately due to the scarce supply of liquid financial assets.\nOur decomposition for the Great Financial Crisis suggests that the sharp increase in producer prices was predominantly due to supply factors. This result lends support to research emphasizing the cost pressures on U.S. producers emanating from higher global commodity prices and reduced availability of credit in the initial phase of the crisis. In the second phase, after the severe disruption to financial markets and sharp decline in aggregate activity triggered by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the decomposition intuitively shows that the resulting changes in prices are driven mostly by demand factors.\nCovid and its aftermath\nThe decomposition in Figure 3 also shows features of the Covid period that are both intuitive and revealing. The change in PPIs during the first few months of the pandemic is skewed to changes in demand factors, which aligns with the experience of extensive shutdowns during this period. In subsequent months (from mid-2020 into 2021), however, supply factors quickly moved from being a drag on prices to being a driver of price increases. Indeed, significant jumps in supply factors occur around February 2021, aligning with the so-called Texas Freeze that had dramatic effects on the petrochemical and downstream industries. It was also during this time that semiconductor shortages began to impact prices and delivery times of many manufactured goods including automobiles, computers, household appliances and other consumer electronics.\nNoticeable changes in the demand contributions lag those of supply, with a switch from a drag on prices to supporting price increases in the first half of 2021. Supply contributions to price increases peak in the latter half of 2021, while demand contributions peak in early 2022, very soon (maybe a quarter or two) after U.S. monetary policy tightens.\nMore recently, both supply and demand have moved into negative territory in 2023, with once again supply moving more suddenly and somewhat in advance of the demand contributions. In the last data point, in December 2023, supply factors remain the main drag on goods prices, although in the last five months demand is beginning to exert significant downward pressure as well.\nCombining novel survey evidence with a structural VAR model of quantities and prices, we decompose the role of supply and demand factors in U.S. manufacturing producer price inflation from 2007 to 2023. Such a decomposition is particularly useful in recent years encompassing the post-COVID inflation surge, as policymakers and market participants debate the relative impacts of monetary policy versus supply chain normalization in the rapid disinflationary period observed in 2022 and 2023. Over the last several years, our evidence points to a significant role for supply factors in the run-up and retreat of goods prices, with demand factors contributing to that contour, but with a lag. Looking ahead, this decomposition will further our understanding of the forces behind future inflation developments, while also serving to inspire other ways in which survey evidence can be combined with more traditional tools for identifying the mechanisms underlying economic outcomes.\nBai, Xiwen, Jesus Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde, Yiliang Li and Francesco Zanetti (2024). \"DP18785 The Causal Effects of Global Supply Chain Disruptions on Macroeconomic Outcomes: Evidence and Theory\".

These sample correlations are computed over the period 2008-2023 for which quarterly QPC data is available.

      "Mayors blast 'terrible' rural ambulance response times\nAuditor general report shows poor rural response times masked by urban data\nSocial Sharing\nMayors and community leaders in small\u2013town New Brunswick say they weren't surprised at all by this week's scathing report by the auditor general about ambulance response times.\nThe audit shows that in many rural and remote communities, Ambulance New Brunswick fails to respond to 90 per cent of calls within its target of 22 minutes.\n\"It's terrible,\" said\u00a0Belledune Mayor Joe Noel. \"It shouldn't be allowed and there's no need for it.\"\nBut those shortfalls are obscured, and don't count against ANB's performance payments, because they're combined with better response times in urban centres for measuring performance--which is allowed under the company's contract.\nBlackville Mayor Chris Hennessy said\u00a0the report is a vindication for him.\n\"They basically bury the rural stats in the urban numbers so they never show the bad with the good,\" he said.\n\"I know people thought I was crazy when I was preaching about this for the last five years \u2026 so I'm glad somebody uncovered that.\"\u00a0\nRural vs. urban response\nThe aggregation of the numbers allows Medavie Health Services New Brunswick, which operates the ambulance service, to collect $650,000 a year for hitting the broader 90-percent target in four large zones that include cities and towns.\u00a0\n\"They're meeting them on the backs of the rural areas,\" Noel said.\n\"That's exactly what happens here. When an ambulance goes out in Campbellton or Bathurst, they take the ambulance from Belledune and send it to Bathurst or Campbellton to sit there, whether it gets a call or not...\n\"That's where the calls are and that's why they're doing it: because it makes their numbers look good.\"\u00a0\nHarvey Mayor Winston Gamblin said\u00a0response times in the village are good when the ambulance happens to be at its local station.\u00a0\nBut when it's been shifting elsewhere, paramedics have a hard time reaching some locations within 22 minutes.\n\"We feel that if you live in a rural area, you have to take second best, and that's the way it came out in the report yesterday -- that we're second class citizens and [they say] 'we'll get there when we can,'\" he said.\nAmbulance targets\nUnder Medavie's contract with the province, ambulances must hit response targets 90 per cent of the time for the organization to receive performance payments.\nThe targets are to reach the scene of a call within nine minutes in 16 urban areas and within 22 minutes everywhere else in New Brunswick.\nThe audit found that in 19 out of 67 communities, ANB fell short of the 90 per cent goal.\u00a0\nBut because response times are blended together within four large zones, it \"masked\" the poor numbers in those rural, remote communities, Auditor General Kim Adair-MacPherson said Tuesday.\nHer audit said the system \"has introduced a bias toward achieving high performance in areas of greater population density, to the detriment of rural or remote communities where 911 calls occur less frequently.\"\nRural areas were at a disadvantage because the system is \"reducing the emphasis on improving performance in those areas,\" allowing Medavie \"to focus resources on urban areas while having decreased performance in outlying communities.\"\nIn a statement released Tuesday, Medavie Health Services New Brunswick president Richard Losier agreed the average response time \"varies from community to community.\"\nBut he pointed out what Adair-MacPherson's audit acknowledged: that the contract doesn't rate performance community by community but in four large zones.\n\"MHSNB is always open and willing to work with our government partners to improve the services to the people of New Brunswick,\" he said.\nMedavie mum\nMedavie did not respond to a request Wednesday for an interview with Losier.\nOn Tuesday Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she was talking to Medavie officials about renegotiating the contract, which was renewed in 2017 for another 10 years.\nNoel said\u00a0rural response times should carry more weight in measuring ambulance performance.\n\"When you're 25 minutes away from a hospital to start with, that's where you need the response times,\" he said.\nBelledune had the lowest number of any community measured by the auditor general: ambulances reached their destination within 22 minutes in only 69 per cent of calls.\nMarc Henrie, the former chair of the Saint-Paul local service district north of Moncton, said\u00a0he was not surprised to see the Fords Mills ambulance station with the second-worst rate in the report.\nAmbulances based there reach calls within 22 minutes in only 70 per cent of cases.\n\"The auditor general just released proof that rural citizens are sadly taken as citizens of a second-class,\" he said.\nHenrie chaired the LSD when Ambulance New Brunswick decided to put its bay in Fords Mills rather than in another location closer to Saint-Paul and Route 126, where he says most people in the area live.\n\"The numbers are not surprising at all,\" he said.\nSometimes ambulances responding to calls in the Saint-Paul area are sent from Salisbury, even though Moncton is closer. Henrie believes it's so ambulances based in Moncton can stay there and respond to calls in and around the city.\u00a0\n\"It's clear that it's not strategic and it's not what's for the well-being in an emergency situation,\" he says.\nGamblin says he's glad to see the auditor general put the spotlight on the problem but worries it will discourage people from moving to smaller communities. \"It's not an advertisement for rural areas,\" he says.\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nProvincial Affairs reporter\nJacques Poitras has been CBC's provincial affairs reporter in New Brunswick since 2000.

      "Ambulance wait times endangering patients, doctors say\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nWatch: Injured 10-year-old told ambulance would take hours\nDoctors and paramedics have told the BBC that long waits for ambulances across the UK are having a \"dangerous impact\" on patient safety. \nBBC analysis found a 77% rise in the most serious safety incidents logged by paramedics in England over the past year, compared to before the pandemic. \nIn Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the 999 system is also under \"tremendous pressure\", doctors say.\nNHS England said the safety of patients is its \"absolute priority\".\n'Help should have been there'\nIn October, nine-year-old Willow Clark fell off her bike on a country path in Hertfordshire, cracking her helmet and leaving her with a fractured skull and a nine-inch laceration across her leg.\n\"I could see it was a really bad accident and I was 20 minutes away from home screaming for help,\" said her mother Sam. \"These really nice people who were passing by phoned 999.\n\"They explained she had a severe head injury and her leg was badly hurt but we were told it would be a 10-hour wait for an ambulance and we'd have to get her to hospital ourselves.\"\nSam's husband had to drive through a farmer's field to pick up his daughter. \nWhen they got to A&E, Willow was immediately transferred to the trauma department. Doctors told her family that she should not have been moved because of her back and neck injuries.\n\"It's the first time I've ever had to phone an ambulance and I was so disappointed,\" said Sam. \"When we really needed it, help just wasn't there and it should have been.\"\nShe later found out that Willow had been classified as an \"urgent\" category three case, meaning an ambulance should have arrived within 120 minutes.\nEast of England Ambulance Service said it was under \"significant pressure\" that day because of a high number of 999 calls and was asking some patients to make their own way to hospital. \nIt has apologised, and said Willow - now 10 - should have been dealt with as a more critical category two case.\nSamantha's daughter Willow is still in some pain and has problems with her sight after her accident in October\nWillow's experience, although traumatic for her family, was not recorded as a serious safety incident by the NHS. \nTo reach that threshold, an incident must have potentially led to long-term harm or death. \nBBC research shows there were 551 serious safety reports filed by ambulance staff in England between March 2021 and February 2022, up from 312 in the same period before the pandemic.\nWithin that data, there were 201 unintended or unexpected deaths, up from 78 in 2019/20.\nThe data does depend on staff deciding to report problems, and not all serious incidents will be linked to long ambulance delays. The largest proportion though do relate to the 'access, admission or transfer' of patients.\nCoroners and lawyers have highlighted recent cases including:\nStaffordshire's assistant coroner issued a 'prevention of future deaths' warning, external after a patient in Stoke died after waiting eight hours for an ambulance\nThe family of a man who died after waiting nine hours for treatment has issued a legal challenge against the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service over a \"chronic shortage\" of ambulances\nThe London Ambulance service is investigating after a man died when paramedics took almost 70 minutes to respond to a suspected heart attack\nDr Katherine Henderson, an A&E consultant and president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC's Today programme the problem with ambulance waits was \"more serious than we've ever seen it\".\nShe said: \"We've got big queues - we can't get flow out of our departments. The underlying reason is that emergency departments are absolutely packed.\"\nDr Henderson explained the bottleneck was caused by emergency departments having to wait to move patients into wards.\nLengthy response times\nAll 10 of England's major ambulance trusts have raised their internal alert level to a point indicating they are under severe or extreme pressure, research for the BBC has found. \nThe latest data from NHS England shows that response times are now at their highest since the current system was introduced five years ago.\nIn April, crews were responding to a \"life-threatening\" callout in nine minutes and two seconds on average, significantly above the seven-minute national target. \nThe response time for a category two emergency, such as a heart attack or a stroke, has risen to more than 51 minutes, almost three times longer than the 18-minute target.\nOne paramedic, who often works as a clinical call handler, told the BBC: \"Sitting staring at a screen with over 400 people waiting for an ambulance is soul-destroying.\n\"Do the delays mean people are dying? Absolutely, but we also need to be educating people on when someone really needs an ambulance.\"\nShe said that on one recent shift, the longest wait for a category two emergency was more than 15 hours, for an elderly man with abdominal pain.\nThe patient hadn't phoned again overnight and no welfare calls had taken place. When the crew arrived the next morning, they found the man dead.\nThere are different factors behind the long waiting times.\nThe ambulance service is seeing record levels of demand this year, as Covid restrictions have been lifted. \nMore than 860,000 calls to 999 were answered in England in April, 20% higher than in the same month in 2019.\nThere is a national shortage of paramedics across the UK, and Covid has still been causing disruption - with higher levels of staff sickness over the winter.\nCrucially though, ambulance crews themselves have faced long delays when they pick up patients and then try to deliver them to hospital staff in a busy emergency department.\nIn the first week of April, around one in ten patients had to wait more than an hour for their ambulance to be unloaded in England, far higher than the same week last year, and well above the 15-minute NHS target.\nAnother paramedic told the BBC that those kinds of waits were having a 'dangerous impact' on patient safety. \n\"We are doing the job to provide emergency care and to save lives, but actually now we are just an extended ward of the hospital,\" he said.\n\"I'm meant to care for a patient who had been in the back of my ambulance for 14 hours, but nobody has ever really taught me how to look after someone like that.\"\nThe Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE), which represents services across the whole UK, says handover delays cut the number of hours crews could operate by \"up to one-third\" in some areas in March.\n\"The potential harm... could be impacting thousands of patients every month, with obvious knock-on effects on the morale and wellbeing of staff,\" managing director Martin Flaherty said.\n\"Every possible effort is being made to prioritise those patients whose conditions are most serious. \n\"Sadly, given the loss of capacity associated with handover delays, this is simply not always possible to achieve.\"\nAmbulances waiting outside Royal Stoke University Hospital on 12 April, 2022\nBBC News has spoken to patients in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who have experienced similarly long waits:\nLast week, one in 10 ambulances across Scotland took more than 80 minutes to drop patients at an emergency department\nWelsh Ambulance Service figures show just 51% of immediately life-threatening calls were reached within the target time of eight minutes in March, well below the 65% target\nIn Northern Ireland, ambulance delays could have contributed to 14 deaths in the past year, the service's chief executive told BBC News\nAn NHS England official said it was working closely with ambulance trusts and care homes to free up more capacity in accident and emergency departments.\n\"The safety of patients is our absolute priority and it is a good thing that more staff are being encouraged to report all incidents to help prevent repetition,\" she said. \n\"There's no doubt the last few months have been some of the toughest ever for NHS staff, with ambulances responding to the highest number of 999 calls on record over the past year, while more than a 10th of all hospital beds have been filled by people fit to be discharged to services such as social-care providers.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson in England said \"a record \u00c2\u00a336bn\" from the health and social care levy was being provided over the next three years for the NHS and social care.\nThere is also a plan to tackle the Covid backlog, and additional funding this year to support increased NHS 111 capacity in taking calls, to ensure people only visit A&E when necessary.\n\"We recognise the unprecedented pressure NHS staff are under from the pandemic - especially frontline ambulance workers,\" the spokesperson said.\nAdditional reporting by Victoria Park.\nHave you experienced a long delay, either waiting for an ambulance or at A&E?

      "Contents\n2024 United Kingdom riots\nFar-right protesters:[b]\nGovernment of the United Kingdom[3]\nCounter-protests\nIn late July and August 2024, far-right protesters[b] rioted in various parts of the United Kingdom[a]\nin response to a mass stabbing in Southport, Merseyside on 29 July 2024 which killed three children and injured ten other people.\nThe riots began on 30 July when a crowd, some of whom police believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, gathered outside Southport Mosque. The protesters wrongly believed the suspect in the mass stabbing was a Muslim immigrant, due to the spread of disinformation on social media platforms. They attacked police officers, threw objects at the mosque, and set a police vehicle on fire. The riot left over fifty officers injured, some seriously, three police dogs wounded, and multiple arrests were made. The unrest spread to other parts of the UK in the following days. On 31 July, over 100 protesters were arrested in London and demonstrations occurred in Manchester, Hartlepool and Aldershot. On 2 August, rioting took place in Sunderland. A police station was set on fire, three police officers were injured, and several people arrested. On 3 August, far-right protesters again clashed with police in various locations, as well as with anti-racist counter-protests.\nThe riots have been described as being Islamophobic,[11][12][13] racially charged,[14][15][16] anti-immigration,[17][18][16] and far-right.[b] The fascist National Front party and neo-Nazi group British Movement spread misinformation online,[26][27] and members of the neo-Nazi group Patriotic Alternative took part in and helped organise the Southport riots.[28][2]\nBackground\nSouthport stabbing\nOn 29 July 2024, a knife attack took place at a children's yoga and dance workshop. Three children were killed, and eight other children were injured, with five of them in critical condition. Two adults at the event were also critically injured.[29]\nFalse claims\nFollowing the stabbing, there was incorrect speculation and disinformation online about the suspected attacker.[30] Misinformation, including false claims about the suspect's identity, nationality, religion and immigration status, were circulated on social media by high-profile far-right accounts.[31] The false claim that the perpetrator was named \"Ali Al-Shakati\" is believed to have originated from the X account of an anti-lockdown campaigner and gained a greater audience when repeated by the website Channel 3 Now. Andrew Tate also posted on X that the attacker was an \"illegal immigrant\", and ex-boxer Anthony Fowler shared that it was a \"fellow from Syria\".[32][33] A newly created \"Southport-themed\" Telegram group became inundated with misinformation, including from the far-right National Front, prior to dissemination on social media platforms,[26] as well as disinformation spread on social media by the neo-Nazi group British Movement.[27]\nMerseyside Police attempted to quell speculation by confirming that the name being circulated was not connected to the case and was not the suspect,[34] and it was later reported that the suspect was born in Wales to Rwandan parents and moved to the Southport area in 2013.[35][36] The spread of misinformation has widely been attributed to the cause of the riots.[37][38][39][40]\nProfessor of political communication, Andrew Chadwick, described a viral tweet as being \"deliberately fabricated to generate hostility toward ethnic minorities and immigrants, and it's a potentially Islamophobic piece of propaganda\".[41] Matthew Feldman, an expert on right-wing extremism, commented \"It is difficult to think of a much better example of online harms breaching the real world than a fake story demonising Muslims and people of colour and leading to riots on the streets\".[42] Former security minister, Stephen McPartland, accused Russia and Vladimir Putin's regime of involvement in the campaign of misinformation, describing it as \"part of the Russian playbook\".[43] Guardian columnist Owen Jones blamed X (formerly Twitter) as a \"cesspit of disinformation and far-right talking points\" for the spread of unverified claims.[44]\nTimeline\n30 July\nAt approximately 20:05 BST, hundreds of protesters gathered outside Southport Mosque chanting, \"No surrender!\" and \"English till I die!\"[45] Within several minutes, protesters clashed with police.[46] Protesters barricaded themselves and shouted \"Tommy Robinson,\" a far-right activist who founded the English Defence League (EDL). Robinson had been arrested and then released two days prior.[47] By 20:37, protesters began throwing objects at the mosque and police, leaving one officer injured.[48] A police van was set alight[49] as police deployed smoke canisters.[50] Merseyside Police requested officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Constabulary, Lancashire Police, and North Wales Police.[51] Riot police cleared the area near the mosque by 21:14[52] and protesters began dispersing shortly after that as night fell.[53] By 23:14, the riot had ended.[49] A local convenience store was damaged.[54]\nDuring the riot, The Guardian said that far-right activists had been promoting the protest that started in Southport,[45] prior to involvement in the riot.[19] Huff Post described far-right activists as having \"hijacked\" the vigil for the victims,[55] and Manchester Evening News reported \"far right thugs, fuelled by lies, sought to exploit the tragedy\".[56] Merseyside Police said on the night of the riot that they believed supporters of the English Defence League were involved in and organised the disturbances.[1][57][58] Hope Not Hate described them as supporters of Tommy Robinson.[59] Robinson denied the EDL were involved, while arguing that the anger in Southport was justified.[41] A prominent member of the neo-Nazi group Patriotic Alternative took part in the riot and another member helped to promote the event.[2][28]\nThe following day, the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate warned of the possibility of further demonstrations by far-right groups in several cities across the country.[43] Concerns of further violence were echoed by Merseyside Police.[60]\n31 July\nIn London, the Metropolitan Police established public order conditions for a protest dubbed \"Enough is Enough\",[43] the slogan of Patriotic Alternative,[26] where far-right demonstrators clashed with police on 31 July.[61][62] More than 100 people were arrested.[7]\nOn the evening of 31 July, a group of approximately 40 demonstrators[63] gathered outside a Holiday Inn in Manchester which was purportedly housing asylum seekers. Chants were heard of the group exclaiming \"we want our country back\", a phrase associated with far-right groups in the UK.[64] Two people were arrested.[7]\nDemonstrations also broke out in the County Durham town of Hartlepool on the same evening. Objects including eggs and glass bottles were thrown at the police in response to the latter's riot shields.[65][66] Several police officers were injured and a police car was set alight. Eight people were arrested.[7]\nThere was also a protest outside a hotel housing migrants in Aldershot. Police and crime commissioner, Donna Jones, described \"mob-type\" behaviour, and Hampshire Constabulary reported a crowd of 200 people, with a minority throwing objects and subjecting people to racial abuse.[67]\nThe organiser of a march in Middlesbrough was arrested by Cleveland Police on suspicion of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.[68]\n2 August\nOn the evening of 2 August, protestors gathered in Sunderland's Keel Square for a march around the city centre. Mounted officers from Northumbria Police attended the demonstration along with officers in riot gear. Police and protestors clashed outside a mosque in St Mark's Road after some of the marchers attempted to approach the building. The protestors chanted \"save our kids\" and \"we want our country back\", as well as slogans in support of Tommy Robinson, and Islamophobic slurs.[69][70] An Uber taxi was burnt and shops looted. Sunderland Central police station was set alight, and trains to Sunderland were cancelled or diverted to St Peter's.[71][72] Eight people were subsequently arrested and three police officers hospitalised.[5]\nA hundred protestors shouting anti-immigrant slogans gathered in Liverpool on the same evening.[73][74]\n3 August\nOn 3 August, numerous far-right rallies and counter-protests occurred in England. In Leeds, approximately 150 protesters chanted slogans such as \"paedo Muslims off our street\" and \"stop the boats\", with counter-protesters chanting \"Nazi scum off our streets\". In Manchester, 150 protesters took part in the \"Enough is Enough\" protest. In Nottingham, clashes were reported between opposing groups of protesters, and in Stoke-on-Trent, there appeared to be a stand-off between groups of protesters. In Hull, protesters attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers, throwing bricks and smashing windows,[10] and in Liverpool, far-right protesters threw bricks at police.[6] Police in Bristol made multiple arrests and closed roads after protestors gathered in Castle Park.[75][76]\nIn Liverpool, shops were looted and a library was set on fire.[77]\nA protest also took place in Belfast, where anti-immigration and anti-racism demonstrators were kept apart by police. A shop on the city's Botanic Avenue was damaged when protesters and counter-protesters smashed windows and damaged furniture. Fireworks were also thrown during the march.[78]\nIt was reported that there are discussions about courts in the England and Wales jurisdiction opening overnight to preliminarily rule on suspects of committing crimes arrested by the police. This also happened during the 2011 England riots.[79]\nAftermath\nThe Merseyside Police Federation said that over fifty officers were injured at the Southport incident, with North West Ambulance Service reporting that twenty-seven were hospitalised and twelve were discharged at the scene.[80] Merseyside Police stated that eight officers were seriously injured and three police dogs were wounded.[81]\nOne man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possessing a bladed article.[82] Police put in place a 24-hour Section 60 Order giving officers further stop-and-search authority, and a Section 34 Order, allowing police to direct people who are engaging in certain activities away from the area. Merseyside Police deployed additional officers after the riot, and ambulance resources remained.[80]\nAccording to The Independent, the Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is \"reviewing whether the far-right English Defence League [...] should be made a proscribed terrorist organisation\", after its connection to the riots,[43] a suggestion echoed by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.[83] The Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was criticised for suggesting that the truth was being withheld, and subsequently accused of inciting violence and creating conspiracy theories by a former counter-terrorism police officer,[84] as well as condemned by the husband of the murdered MP Jo Cox, who accused Farage of \"inciting a riot\".[85] Farage was also accused of giving legitimacy to acts of violence by Steve Rotheram, the Mayor of Liverpool City Region, after releasing a video in which he said the protests were \"nothing to what could happen over the course of the next few weeks\".[86]\nResponses\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer wrote that those who had \"hijacked the vigil for the victims\" had \"insulted the community as it grieves\" and that rioters would feel the full force of the law.[87] On 1 August, and following a meeting with senior police officers, Starmer announced the establishment of a national violent disorder programme to facilitate greater cooperation between police forces when dealing with violent disorder.[88]\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the riot as appalling and requested a criminal investigation.[89] The MP for Southport, Patrick Hurley, said on BBC Radio 4's Today on 31 July, that the rioters were not local residents, but were \"thugs who'd got the train in\" and were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children, and [...] the town\".[90] The rioters had broken windows of Southport Mosque; Hurley told Today that people \"were using the horrific incident on Monday, the deaths of three little kiddies, for their own political purposes\".[91]\nThe Liverpool Region Mosque Network and the Muslim Association of Britain released statements condemning the riot.[92] Ahead of anticipated protests the following weekend, the Muslim Council of Britain recommended that mosques \"review and strengthen their security protocols\".[93][94]\nOn 2 August, and with a number of further protests expected to occur over subsequent days, Home Office minister David Hanson said that police were monitoring organisations, and would use face recognition technology to identify anyone involved in violence.[95]\nIn response to the far-right rallies, counter-protests by anti-racists were organised under the banner of \"Stop the far right: Don\u2019t let the racists divide us\", predominantly by Stand Up to Racism.[96]\nChurch leaders in Northern Ireland condemned calls for anti-Islamic protests in the province on the weekend following the stabbing.[13] The Police Service of Northern Ireland have said that they are planning a proportionate response.[97]\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences"

      "Contents\n2024 United Kingdom riots\nFar-right protesters:[b]\nGovernment of the United Kingdom[3]\nCounter-protests\nIn late July and August 2024, far-right protesters[b] rioted in various parts of the United Kingdom[a]\nin response to a mass stabbing in Southport, Merseyside on 29 July 2024 which killed three children and injured ten other people.\nThe riots began on 30 July when a crowd, some of whom police believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, gathered outside Southport Mosque. The protesters wrongly believed the suspect in the mass stabbing was a Muslim immigrant, due to the spread of disinformation on social media platforms. They attacked police officers, threw objects at the mosque, and set a police vehicle on fire. The riot left over fifty officers injured, some seriously, three police dogs wounded, and multiple arrests were made. The unrest spread to other parts of the UK in the following days. On 31 July, over 100 protesters were arrested in London and demonstrations occurred in Manchester, Hartlepool and Aldershot. On 2 August, rioting took place in Sunderland. A police station was set on fire, three police officers were injured, and several people arrested. On 3 August, far-right protesters again clashed with police in various locations, as well as with anti-racist counter-protests.\nThe riots have been described as being Islamophobic,[11][12][13] racially charged,[14][15][16] anti-immigration,[17][18][16] and far-right.[b] The fascist National Front party and neo-Nazi group British Movement spread misinformation online,[26][27] and members of the neo-Nazi group Patriotic Alternative took part in and helped organise the Southport riots.[28][2]\nBackground\nSouthport stabbing\nOn 29 July 2024, a knife attack took place at a children's yoga and dance workshop. Three children were killed, and eight other children were injured, with five of them in critical condition. Two adults at the event were also critically injured.[29]\nFalse claims\nFollowing the stabbing, there was incorrect speculation and disinformation online about the suspected attacker.[30] Misinformation, including false claims about the suspect's identity, nationality, religion and immigration status, were circulated on social media by high-profile far-right accounts.[31] The false claim that the perpetrator was named \"Ali Al-Shakati\" is believed to have originated from the X account of an anti-lockdown campaigner and gained a greater audience when repeated by the website Channel 3 Now. Andrew Tate also posted on X that the attacker was an \"illegal immigrant\", and ex-boxer Anthony Fowler shared that it was a \"fellow from Syria\".[32][33] A newly created \"Southport-themed\" Telegram group became inundated with misinformation, including from the far-right National Front, prior to dissemination on social media platforms,[26] as well as disinformation spread on social media by the neo-Nazi group British Movement.[27]\nMerseyside Police attempted to quell speculation by confirming that the name being circulated was not connected to the case and was not the suspect,[34] and it was later reported that the suspect was born in Wales to Rwandan parents and moved to the Southport area in 2013.[35][36] The spread of misinformation has widely been attributed to the cause of the riots.[37][38][39][40]\nProfessor of political communication, Andrew Chadwick, described a viral tweet as being \"deliberately fabricated to generate hostility toward ethnic minorities and immigrants, and it's a potentially Islamophobic piece of propaganda\".[41] Matthew Feldman, an expert on right-wing extremism, commented \"It is difficult to think of a much better example of online harms breaching the real world than a fake story demonising Muslims and people of colour and leading to riots on the streets\".[42] Former security minister, Stephen McPartland, accused Russia and Vladimir Putin's regime of involvement in the campaign of misinformation, describing it as \"part of the Russian playbook\".[43] Guardian columnist Owen Jones blamed X (formerly Twitter) as a \"cesspit of disinformation and far-right talking points\" for the spread of unverified claims.[44]\nTimeline\n30 July\nAt approximately 20:05 BST, hundreds of protesters gathered outside Southport Mosque chanting, \"No surrender!\" and \"English till I die!\"[45] Within several minutes, protesters clashed with police.[46] Protesters barricaded themselves and shouted \"Tommy Robinson,\" a far-right activist who founded the English Defence League (EDL). Robinson had been arrested and then released two days prior.[47] By 20:37, protesters began throwing objects at the mosque and police, leaving one officer injured.[48] A police van was set alight[49] as police deployed smoke canisters.[50] Merseyside Police requested officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Constabulary, Lancashire Police, and North Wales Police.[51] Riot police cleared the area near the mosque by 21:14[52] and protesters began dispersing shortly after that as night fell.[53] By 23:14, the riot had ended.[49] A local convenience store was damaged.[54]\nDuring the riot, The Guardian said that far-right activists had been promoting the protest that started in Southport,[45] prior to involvement in the riot.[19] Huff Post described far-right activists as having \"hijacked\" the vigil for the victims,[55] and Manchester Evening News reported \"far right thugs, fuelled by lies, sought to exploit the tragedy\".[56] Merseyside Police said on the night of the riot that they believed supporters of the English Defence League were involved in and organised the disturbances.[1][57][58] Hope Not Hate described them as supporters of Tommy Robinson.[59] Robinson denied the EDL were involved, while arguing that the anger in Southport was justified.[41] A prominent member of the neo-Nazi group Patriotic Alternative took part in the riot and another member helped to promote the event.[2][28]\nThe following day, the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate warned of the possibility of further demonstrations by far-right groups in several cities across the country.[43] Concerns of further violence were echoed by Merseyside Police.[60]\n31 July\nIn London, the Metropolitan Police established public order conditions for a protest dubbed \"Enough is Enough\",[43] the slogan of Patriotic Alternative,[26] where far-right demonstrators clashed with police on 31 July.[61][62] More than 100 people were arrested.[7]\nOn the evening of 31 July, a group of approximately 40 demonstrators[63] gathered outside a Holiday Inn in Manchester which was purportedly housing asylum seekers. Chants were heard of the group exclaiming \"we want our country back\", a phrase associated with far-right groups in the UK.[64] Two people were arrested.[7]\nDemonstrations also broke out in the County Durham town of Hartlepool on the same evening. Objects including eggs and glass bottles were thrown at the police in response to the latter's riot shields.[65][66] Several police officers were injured and a police car was set alight. Eight people were arrested.[7]\nThere was also a protest outside a hotel housing migrants in Aldershot. Police and crime commissioner, Donna Jones, described \"mob-type\" behaviour, and Hampshire Constabulary reported a crowd of 200 people, with a minority throwing objects and subjecting people to racial abuse.[67]\nThe organiser of a march in Middlesbrough was arrested by Cleveland Police on suspicion of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.[68]\n2 August\nOn the evening of 2 August, protestors gathered in Sunderland's Keel Square for a march around the city centre. Mounted officers from Northumbria Police attended the demonstration along with officers in riot gear. Police and protestors clashed outside a mosque in St Mark's Road after some of the marchers attempted to approach the building. The protestors chanted \"save our kids\" and \"we want our country back\", as well as slogans in support of Tommy Robinson, and Islamophobic slurs.[69][70] An Uber taxi was burnt and shops looted. Sunderland Central police station was set alight, and trains to Sunderland were cancelled or diverted to St Peter's.[71][72] Eight people were subsequently arrested and three police officers hospitalised.[5]\nA hundred protestors shouting anti-immigrant slogans gathered in Liverpool on the same evening.[73][74]\n3 August\nOn 3 August, numerous far-right rallies and counter-protests occurred in England. In Leeds, approximately 150 protesters chanted slogans such as \"paedo Muslims off our street\" and \"stop the boats\", with counter-protesters chanting \"Nazi scum off our streets\". In Manchester, 150 protesters took part in the \"Enough is Enough\" protest. In Nottingham, clashes were reported between opposing groups of protesters, and in Stoke-on-Trent, there appeared to be a stand-off between groups of protesters. In Hull, protesters attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers, throwing bricks and smashing windows,[10] and in Liverpool, far-right protesters threw bricks at police.[6] Police in Bristol made multiple arrests and closed roads after protestors gathered in Castle Park.[75][76]\nIn Liverpool, shops were looted and a library was set on fire.[77]\nA protest also took place in Belfast, where anti-immigration and anti-racism demonstrators were kept apart by police. A shop on the city's Botanic Avenue was damaged when protesters and counter-protesters smashed windows and damaged furniture. Fireworks were also thrown during the march.[78]\nIt was reported that there are discussions about courts in the England and Wales jurisdiction opening overnight to preliminarily rule on suspects of committing crimes arrested by the police. This also happened during the 2011 England riots.[79]\nAftermath\nThe Merseyside Police Federation said that over fifty officers were injured at the Southport incident, with North West Ambulance Service reporting that twenty-seven were hospitalised and twelve were discharged at the scene.[80] Merseyside Police stated that eight officers were seriously injured and three police dogs were wounded.[81]\nOne man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possessing a bladed article.[82] Police put in place a 24-hour Section 60 Order giving officers further stop-and-search authority, and a Section 34 Order, allowing police to direct people who are engaging in certain activities away from the area. Merseyside Police deployed additional officers after the riot, and ambulance resources remained.[80]\nAccording to The Independent, the Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is \"reviewing whether the far-right English Defence League [...] should be made a proscribed terrorist organisation\", after its connection to the riots,[43] a suggestion echoed by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.[83] The Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was criticised for suggesting that the truth was being withheld, and subsequently accused of inciting violence and creating conspiracy theories by a former counter-terrorism police officer,[84] as well as condemned by the husband of the murdered MP Jo Cox, who accused Farage of \"inciting a riot\".[85] Farage was also accused of giving legitimacy to acts of violence by Steve Rotheram, the Mayor of Liverpool City Region, after releasing a video in which he said the protests were \"nothing to what could happen over the course of the next few weeks\".[86]\nResponses\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer wrote that those who had \"hijacked the vigil for the victims\" had \"insulted the community as it grieves\" and that rioters would feel the full force of the law.[87] On 1 August, and following a meeting with senior police officers, Starmer announced the establishment of a national violent disorder programme to facilitate greater cooperation between police forces when dealing with violent disorder.[88]\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the riot as appalling and requested a criminal investigation.[89] The MP for Southport, Patrick Hurley, said on BBC Radio 4's Today on 31 July, that the rioters were not local residents, but were \"thugs who'd got the train in\" and were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children, and [...] the town\".[90] The rioters had broken windows of Southport Mosque; Hurley told Today that people \"were using the horrific incident on Monday, the deaths of three little kiddies, for their own political purposes\".[91]\nThe Liverpool Region Mosque Network and the Muslim Association of Britain released statements condemning the riot.[92] Ahead of anticipated protests the following weekend, the Muslim Council of Britain recommended that mosques \"review and strengthen their security protocols\".[93][94]\nOn 2 August, and with a number of further protests expected to occur over subsequent days, Home Office minister David Hanson said that police were monitoring organisations, and would use face recognition technology to identify anyone involved in violence.[95]\nIn response to the far-right rallies, counter-protests by anti-racists were organised under the banner of \"Stop the far right: Don\u2019t let the racists divide us\", predominantly by Stand Up to Racism.[96]\nChurch leaders in Northern Ireland condemned calls for anti-Islamic protests in the province on the weekend following the stabbing.[13] The Police Service of Northern Ireland have said that they are planning a proportionate response.[97]\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences",

In the UK there has been a radical shift in how (and whether) many of us travel to and for work, for shopping and for leisure. This shift has had a very visible impact on our towns and cities, with urban centres at times during 2020 appearing virtually empty and at other times hyper-congested as people have sought alternative means of transport in response to the evolving pandemic.\nEach year the London Ambulance Service (LAS) typically attends around 1.1m incidents while the London Fire Brigade 1 (LFB) attends around 100,000 incidents . In many cases the 2 speed of these responses can mean the difference between life and death, so over the years, considerable effort and money has been invested to shave seconds off response times so that first responders are on the scene as soon as possible.\nMuch has been made of this fact during the recent debates over low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and pop-up cycle lanes introduced as part of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, with opponents of the changes - though typically not the emergency services themselves - routinely claiming that measures to reduce traffic could cost lives by causing delays to fire and ambulance response times. It is true that the response times of these emergency services are sensitive to changes in road conditions, and ambulance chiefs have recently reported that their in house SatNav systems have 3 sometimes not kept pace where changes to road layouts were made rapidly.\nBut there remains no evidence that 4 London\u2019s new active travel measures have yet caused any measurable increase in overall emergency response times .\n5 LFB records do show an increase in reported delays due to traffic calming measures in fire crew incident reports in areas where LTNs have been introduced but, crucially, any such impacts experienced and reported by crews were completely 5 London\u2019s Police, Fire Brigade and Ambulance Service have all stated they have no records of increased 999 response times as a result of these measures.\n4 https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/low-traffic-neighbourhoods-ltns-999-calls-lo ndon-ambulance-b953716.html 3 https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/london-ambulances-need-new-live-data -systems-to-beat-traffic-jams-in-emergencies-report-claims-a3875251.html 2 https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/incident-response-times-fire-facts 1 https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-in dicators/ 6 offset by a concomitant decrease in other kinds of delays (likely, reduced overall traffic levels across the areas in question) so that the actual recorded response times in these areas have remained unchanged.6 While the novelty of new and unexpected road layouts and the rapid pace of recent changes have given rise to a mismatch between perceived and actual delays to 999 response times, there is another factor affecting these journeys which may suffer from the opposite effect. Traffic congestion is a daily fact of life in the UK capital - ranked as the 8th most congested city in the world in 2019 - that is so 7 mundane as to be effectively invisible to its residents. Yet the resultant risk of delays to emergency vehicles has the clear potential to have a real impact on the outcomes for critically ill patients and people who are victims of fire and accidents.\nUntil the pandemic hit in 2020 it had been difficult to estimate the extent of the effect that congestion has on emergency service response times, or to separate this effect from other factors.\nBut with traffic levels dropping sharply to unprecedented lows during the various lockdowns, an unplanned, living experiment was thrust upon us, allowing us to gain a fuller picture of how much typical congestion levels delay emergency service vehicles in London for the first time.\n7 https://inrix.com/press-releases/2019-traffic-scorecard-uk/ 6 https://findingspress.org/article/23568-the-impact-of-2020-low-traffic-neighbourh oods-on-fire-service-emergency-response-times-in-london-uk 7 Congestion Levels in London In order to quantify the change in congestion levels experienced in London since the pandemic started, three sources of data on traffic levels in London were accessed.\nThe car navigation platform TomTom uses their satellite 8 navigation systems to gather data on congestion in cities around the world, including London. TomTom quantifies congestion by comparing the actual time taken by vehicle drivers in a given hour against an estimate of the time the same journey would take in the absence of any congestion.\nFor example, a congestion level of 36% means that a trip will take 36% more time than it would have done in uncongested conditions.9 At the time of writing, the TomTom website hosted weekly congestion level data for London for the whole of 2021 to date.\nFor 2020 only monthly data was available on the live TomTom website, however it was possible to access data for the first 41 weeks of 2020 by using archive.org\u2019s Wayback Machine.\nThe 10 gap in the weekly data series from October to December 2020 has been bridged by using the monthly data (dashed lines in the chart below).\nThe TomTom data starts with the normal lull in congestion as Londoners return from their Christmas and New Year holidays, with levels rapidly returning to historical norms for the first two months of the year. It then shows a steep reduction in the level of congestion starting well in advance of the official announcement on 23rd March of the first lockdown.\nCongestion reduced from the peak in week 10 of 2020 (2nd March to 8th March) to a minimum in week 14 (29th March to 5th April) before starting to creep back up again early in the lockdown and gradually returning to levels similar to before the lockdown by November.\nThe monthly data for October to December (dashed lines) suggest a smaller reduction during the shorter second lockdown before a more substantial drop over Christmas and as the country entered the third lockdown. Congestion levels then resumed their upwards trend as the lockdown 10 https://web.archive.org/web/20201115144731/https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic -index/london-traffic/ 9 https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/about/ 8 https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/london-traffic/ 8 progressed and as it was gradually phased out starting in March 2021.\nFigure 1: London congestion levels 2020-21 (Source: TomTom) Another relevant source of data exists in the form of an ongoing programme of traffic counts at locations on major and minor roads across the country managed by the Department for Transport.\n149 of the traffic count points in 11 the London region had one of these 12-hour vehicle counts take place in either 2018 or 2019 (mostly between April and June) and another during the first lockdown (all between April and June 2020). Comparing the count in 2018 or 2019, years which represent recent baseline traffic flows, with the count during the first lockdown gives an indication of how traffic flows changed during the pandemic.\nIn total nearly 2 million vehicles of all kinds were logged passing these 149 points during the counts undertaken in 2018 or 2019. At the same 149 points during the pandemic the number of vehicles logged had reduced by an average of 50%: 11 https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/downloads 9 Table 1: Overall traffic flows in London, 2018/19 vs 2020 covid lockdown (Source: Department for Transport road traffic stats) 2018 or 2019 First Lockdown Change Vehicle Type Count Share Count Share Count % Pedal Cycles 3,541 0.2% 6,354 0.6% +2,813 +79% Two Wheeled Motor Vehicles 6,645 0.3% 3,620 0.4% -3,025 -46% Cars and Taxis 1,481,960 74.4% 612,514 61.3% -869,446 -59% Buses and Coaches 10,188 0.5% 2,940 0.3% -7,248 -71% LGVs 281,344 14.1% 204,977 20.5% -76,367 -27% HGVs 207,715 10.4% 169,162 16.9% -38,553 -19% Total 1,991,393 999,567 -991,826 -50% Total Excluding 2 Wheeled 1,981,207 989,593 -991,614 -50% With the exception of pedal cycles, which saw an increase of nearly 80% as Londoners took to bikes to get around, all vehicle types saw a reduction.\nPassenger cars, which accounted for around 75% of vehicles counted pre-pandemic, saw an average reduction of nearly 60% during the pandemic and nearly 90% of the change in vehicle numbers counted can be attributed to this reduction in car and taxi traffic.\nFinally, Transport for London tracks bus speeds across its network to monitor bus service performance and this 12 provides an indirect measure of congestion in London. The data shows a substantial increase in average bus speeds across London during the first and third lockdowns in particular as congestion dropped: 12 https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/buses-performance-data 10 Figure 2: London bus speeds, 2017-2021 (Source: Transport for London) 11 London Fire Brigade Travel Times The London Fire Brigade responds to nearly 100,000 incidents each year (over 250 per day) and records data about the response times, including the time taken to travel from the station to the incident, for each of these.\nIt is therefore 13 possible to build up a detailed picture of how response times have changed in the last few years, in particular during the pandemic.\nThe Greater London area is divided up into a number of station areas. The inner London stations typically cover an area ranging from under 1 square mile to around 6 square miles, with outer London station areas being typically 14 considerably larger, one of the reasons why average response times in outer London are over 30 seconds higher than response times in inner London.\nFigure 3: London Fire station boundaries15 15 https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/brigade_orders_and_ground_maps#i ncoming-597801 14 https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/242506/response/597801/attach/2/LFB %20station%20boundaries.pdf 13 https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-fire-brigade-mobilisation-records 12 The chart below shows the average travel times between the station and the incident of the first appliance to arrive on the scene in each week from the start of 2019 to the end of June 2021, overlaid with the dates of the three lockdowns which had been imposed during the pandemic: Figure 4: LFB 999 response travel times 2019-2021 (Source: London Fire Brigade, Fire Facts) A pronounced reduction in travel times can be seen in the weeks running up to the first lockdown (starting in around week 10 of 2020) as Londoners started taking steps to reduce their movements and traffic levels reduced. Reductions in travel time were also seen during the second and third lockdowns although as congestion levels did not drop as far as during the first lockdown, these were not as pronounced.\nThe relationship between travel time and congestion level reveals that for each percent increase in congestion, the travel time by fire appliances increases by approximately one second: 13 Figure 5: LFB response travel times vs congestion metric.\nInner London fire stations saw a 44 second reduction (-20%) in mean travel times between week 10 and week 14 of 2020 while outer London fire stations saw a 38 second reduction (-14%) over the same period. Travel times in outer London dropped further as lockdown continued, reaching an 18% reduction in week 18 of 2020 compared with week 10.\nComparing April 2020 travel times with April 2019 shows that some inner London stations saw large improvements: 14 Table 2: London fire stations which saw the biggest reductions in 999 response times during April 2020 lockdown.\nStation Name Apr-19 Response Times (s) Apr-20 Response Times (s) Reduction % Change Soho 250 159 1m31s -37% Greenwich 204 148 0m56s -27% Deptford 228 169 0m59s -26% Shoreditch 211 157 0m54s -26% Tooting 246 189 0m57s -23% Paddington 233 183 0m50s -22% Lambeth 214 168 0m46s -22% Islington 233 187 0m46s -20% Peckham 215 173 0m42s -19% Euston 215 174 0m41s -19% Nationally, 999 response times to serious \u2018primary\u2019 fires have been rising inexorably since the 1990s. This rise is almost exclusively attributable to increases in travel time, since crew turnout times have fallen over this period, while call handling times flatlined or fell for protracted periods in which overall response times continued to increase . Government analysis 16 of the factors behind rising fire response times nationally from 1996-2006 concluded that rising traffic levels was the primary cause.17 Our analysis from the London lockdowns shows that when traffic levels fall, fire response times come down too - and that the most plausible explanation for this correlation is causal. To put it another way, the presence of \u2018normal\u2019 levels of motor traffic on the capital\u2019s streets are causing substantial delays to the London Fire Brigade\u2019s response times to the most serious incidents.\n17 https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20120919173844mp_/http://www.\ncommunities.gov.uk/documents/fire/pdf/frsresponsetimes.pdf 16 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/atta chment_data/file/857924/response-times-fires-england-1819-hosb0120.pdf 15 London Ambulance Service Response Times NHS England publishes monthly data on average response times for each region of England, detailing the number of incidents and mean response times by incident category.18 Unlike the fire brigade data, the ambulance data represents the total response time and not just the travel time to the incident. The clock starts when the call is coded as C1, when the first ambulance resource is assigned or 30 seconds after the emergency call connects, whichever is earliest.\nAs a result of this approach to reporting ambulance response times, and in contrast to London Fire Brigade response time datasets, it is not possible to fully disentangle the impact of congestion on ambulance journey times from other factors such as changes in call volumes (e.g. higher call volumes lead to longer call answer times) or changes in staffing levels, both of which are understood to have had a major impact on response times during the pandemic .\n19 Incidents coded as C1 (Category 1) in the data are those that received a response on scene where life-threatening injuries and illnesses, specifically cardiac arrest, were involved. These incidents have a target mean response time of seven minutes. C1 incidents where any patients were transported by an Ambulance Service emergency vehicle are coded as C1T.\nC1T does not include incidents where an ambulance clinician on scene determines that no conveyance is necessary, or incidents with non-emergency conveyance. The C1T response time for an incident is the response time of the first vehicle which is capable of conveying the patient.\nThe NHS ambulance response data goes back as far as the end of 2017 when the C1 category was introduced, and shows the C1 target time of 7 minutes (420 seconds) being met since the summer of 2018. However, as the pandemic hit there was a substantial spike in total response times (see the dotted lines in Figure 6) as an exceptionally large volume of calls were received and the NHS was put under the immense 19 Snooks et al, 2021: Call volume, triage outcomes, and protocols during the first wave of the COVID\u201019 pandemic in the United Kingdom: Results of a national survey https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328888/ 18 https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-in dicators/ 16 pressure of the pandemic.\nThis peak has since been 20 confirmed as London Ambulance Service\u2019s busiest ever month and during this surge, mean call answer times 21 increased from a pre-pandemic average of around 12 seconds to 200 seconds.\nFigure 6: Mean response times net of mean call answer time (solid lines) for C1 and C1T emergency, 2017-2021. The total response times have also been included along with the mean call answer time.22 By deducting the mean call answer time from the total response times we remove one of the major confounding factors (the time for the call to connect), leaving us with an estimate of the average time from the emergency call connecting to an operator through to the ambulance arriving on scene. However, substantial uncertainties remain in the extent to which the reduction in C1T response times which can be seen in the data can be attributed to reduced 22 https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-in dicators/ 21 https://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/2021/09/06/2021-summer-months-three-of-our-top-five-busiest-months-ever/ 20 https://www.hsj.co.uk/ambulance-waiting-times-soared-in-march-as-calls-hit-rec ord-high/7027368.article 17 congestion (for example call duration, ambulance availability or crew turnout times may also have changed during this period).\nAs the ambulance data covers total response time, other factors beyond the level of congestion experienced travelling to an incident are also at play - as in the periods when surging Covid-19 cases overwhelmed the service, which were subsequently followed by a sustained drops in call volumes compared to the baseline.\nPast NHS reviews of the factors 23 behind geographical disparities in ambulance response times have found that these tend to be dominated by the overall workload in urban areas.\nWe therefore cannot state 24 with complete confidence that reduced congestion explains the drop in response times seen during the Covid-19 lockdowns.\nNevertheless, the general trend in response times closely correlates with the congestion trends over the period in question. Moreover, there is no other plausible explanation for the substantially reduced travel response times experienced by the London Fire Brigade during the lockdown periods, and we therefore contend that it is reasonable to conclude that reduced congestion has played a dominant part in these faster response times.\nLondon\u2019s ambulances and fire appliances are using the same roads, after all.\nThis hypothesis is also supported by other circumstantial evidence. For instance, analysis of NHS England data by the Nuffield Trust has found a similar pattern in C1 response times since 2018 at the national level, with a spike at the start of the pandemic followed by a dip during lockdown; but the 25 national reduction in response time during this period was less pronounced than that seen in London - which in normal times is the most congested city in the UK.26 We were not able to determine why average response times between C1 and C1T calls have historically varied so widely.\nBut we speculate that this may be explained by the fact that C1T includes only vehicles capable of conveying patients to hospital, and therefore excludes cycle and motorcycle paramedics, who are typically dispatched to life threatening incidents in parallel with ambulances, and are often first on the scene since they can \u201ccan get through the traffic faster 26 https://inrix.com/press-releases/2019-traffic-scorecard-uk/ 25 https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/ambulance-response-times#background 24 https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ambulance-response-pr ogramme-review.pdf 23 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328888/ 18 than a large ambulance\u201d.\nThis could also explain why the 27 variance between C1 and C1T response times fell to under 100 seconds during lockdown, when it is typically over 300 seconds; perhaps \u201clarge ambulances\u201d were no longer being held up by traffic? Further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis however.\n27 https://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/calling-us/who-will-treat-you/single-respon der/ 19 Implications Although it is well established that there is a causal relationship between fire and ambulance 999 response times and fatality rates, this relationship is in most cases a highly complex one. For instance, the number and range of factors influencing whether a fire leads to fatalities is very large, and the non-linear relationship between fire spread and time elapsed makes it very difficult to draw any straightforward link between 999 response times and outcomes for victims of fires. Outcomes of delays for the diverse range of medical emergencies suffered by Londoners are perhaps even more challenging to quantify, and we were cautioned by clinical researchers that in practice patient outcomes are far too multi-factorial to be amenable to crude attempts at attribution.\nDespite the confounding factors, the Department for Communities and Local Government has in the past used fire service data to develop a benchmark statistical model for planning fire service provision, in the form of the Fire Service Emergency Cover Toolkit.\n\u201cFatality rate response time 28 relationships\u201d were developed which attempted to quantify the impact of different response times on fatality rates for a range of different incident types. There is no real question that Londoners are dying as a consequence of delays to 999 responses caused by congestion - even though it is not practicable to ascertain exactly how many and from what causes.\nIn the context of this report\u2019s focus it should also be noted that of London\u2019s 9,678 serious \u2018primary\u2019 fires in 2019, 1,925 of these involved motor vehicles - around 20% of the total.\nOver 30,000 29 Londoners were casualties of road traffic collisions in 2019, nearly 4000 of whom were seriously injured or killed.\nMotor traffic 30 therefore not only impedes emergency service vehicles on their way to incidents; it also generates a high proportion of the most dangerous incidents being responded to.\n30 https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/road-safety -https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzgyZTc0ZmYtMjlmOC00ZGFmLWJmNzMtZW JkMjdhMDU4MGY1IiwidCI6IjFmYmQ2NWJmLTVkZWYtNGVlYS1hNjkyLWEwODljMjU1MzQ2Y iIsImMiOjh9 29 https://data.london.gov.uk/download/lfb-fires-in-london-1966-2019---fire-facts/cfd 2b25b-8014-436f-add2-a68ef9017bee/Fire%20Facts%20-%20Fires%20in%20Greater% 20London%202019.pdf 28 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2012-updates-to-the-fire-service-em ergency-cover-toolkit-special-service-and-fire-fatality-rate-functions 20 Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of its associated civil lockdowns offer an unprecedented \u2018living experiment\u2019 opportunity to assess the impact of typical congestion levels in London on the response times of its emergency services.\nThis paper has shown that these effects are very substantial, and we believe that in practice they are likely to account for a significant number of excess deaths each year amongst Londoners requiring urgent assistance for both fires and medical emergencies.\nBecause traffic congestion has become an endemic feature of life in London, most residents, including emergency service crews, have become desensitised to its negative effects.\nImaginary grievances about perceived acute impacts on 999 response times arising from new cycle lanes and low traffic neighbourhoods generate sensational headlines and fury on social media -despite not being detectable in official records. Meanwhile the real, chronic impacts of too many cars on the city\u2019s streets are demonstrably preventing life saving emergency services from getting to their destinations as quickly as they might, yet continue to go unremarked and unreported. We hope this short report will go some way towards rectifying this.\n21"

Evans Jr., PhD, APA\u2019s CEO. \u201cLike many other health care providers, psychologists are feeling the pressure.\u201d\nMore than 8 in 10 (84%) psychologists who treat anxiety disorders said they have seen an increase in demand for anxiety treatment since the start of the pandemic, compared with 74% a year ago. Demand for treatment of depression is also up, with 72% of psychologists who treat depressive disorders saying they have seen an increase, compared with 60% in 2020. Other treatment areas with greater demand included sleep-wake disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders, the survey found.\nThe number of psychologists who reported receiving more referrals this year almost doubled from last year (from 37% in 2020 to 62% this year). Almost 7 in 10 psychologists (68%) with a waitlist reported that it had grown longer since the start of the pandemic.\u00a0\nWith these indicators suggesting many psychologists are working at or beyond capacity, more than 4 in 10 (41%) reported being unable to meet the demand for treatment (up from 30% last year), and 46% said they felt burned out (up from 41% last year).\u00a0\n\u201cThese numbers highlight what we have been saying since the early days of the pandemic\u2014we are facing a mental health tsunami,\u201d Evans said. \u201cWe need to continue to support treatment via telehealth, and we must invest in screening, prevention, and innovative interventions to expand access to various levels of care.\u201d\nThe pandemic led to a switch to telehealth for many psychologists, and virtually all clinical psychologists continue to provide at least some services remotely (96%), according to the survey. While few have returned to seeing patients entirely in person since a year ago (about 4% vs. 3% in 2020), a greater number of psychologists have adopted a hybrid approach of seeing some patients in person and some remotely (50% vs. 33% in 2020), revealing a slow progression back to the office.\nAPA continues to advocate for continued flexibility in insurance coverage of telehealth services, including audio-only telehealth, as well as equal coverage and reimbursement for telehealth services in comparison with in-person treatment. Telehealth services enable patients from underserved communities\u2014such as rural areas and communities of color\u2014to access these services, often for the first time.\nDemonstrating that telehealth is here to stay, 96% of psychologists said that the use of telehealth during the pandemic has proven its effectiveness as a therapeutic tool, and 93% said that they intend to continue providing telehealth as an option in their practice after the pandemic.\nIn coping with the additional demand for treatment, more than three-quarters of psychologists said that they were able to maintain a positive work-life balance (77%, up from 66%) and nearly two thirds said that they practiced self-care (64%, up from 55%).\nMethodology\nThe 2021 American Psychological Association\u2019s COVID-19 Practitioner Survey was distributed to approximately 26,400 doctoral-level active licensed psychologists (both APA members and non-members) in the U.S. between August 30 and September 17, 2021.

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n"

      "Findings of Poll 20\nThis study was conducted by Pollara Strategic Insights with an online sample of 3,713 adult Canadians between April 30 and May 16, 2024. The results from this study provide insights into the mental health of Canadians and reveal concerning trends.\u00a0Results from a probability sample of this size could be considered accurate to within \u00b11.6 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Results have been weighted based on age, gender and region to be representative of the Canadian population.\u00a0\n \nA series of research briefs that provide an in-depth, specific investigation of our polling results can be found here.\u00a0Results of earlier polls are compared when applicable. \u00a0\nFindings from our polls are searchable on our free Data Portal.\nOur latest data shows that negative daily impacts of mental health symptoms are at a near record high, and access to support is on the rise.\u00a0\nThe findings reveal significant insights into mental health indicators and emerging trends:\nNegative Impacts of Mental Health Symptoms at Near Record-High:\u00a0 More than one in four (28%) of Canadians report that their mental health symptoms affect their daily functioning, marking the highest percentage recorded since the middle of the pandemic. Over one-third of respondents indicate that mental health symptoms disrupt various aspects of their lives, including work/school (40%), social/leisure (33%), and family/home (36%).\nHigh-Risk Problem Gambling in Canada: 7% of Canadians present high risk of problem gambling, with a higher rate of 15% among those aged 18-34. Those who present high-risk of problem gambling are more likely to face severe mental health issues, including 22% having planned a suicide attempt, and show higher rates of alcohol (38%) and cannabis (49%) dependency compared to non-gamblers.\nUpward Trend in Accessing Mental Health Support: More Canadians have accessed mental health support in the past year (16%), indicating a 5% increase since the summer of 2022.\nHigh Levels of Resilience: Almost seven-in-ten Canadians express confidence in their ability to bounce back from challenges (68%), marking the highest percentage recorded since the inception of this polling series. While younger Canadians are less optimistic, resilience levels have increased across all age groups.\nAdditional major findings from Poll 20 include:\nSelf-reported anxiety levels remain high, with 12% of Canadians experiencing high anxiety. However, there has been a slight decrease in self-reported depression, down to 9% since the last poll. Younger demographics continue to report higher rates of anxiety and depression compared to older cohorts.\nA growing number of Canadians report missing days of work or school due to mental health concerns (11%). Productivity at work or school has declined for 27% of respondents, reflecting a 6% increase since the previous poll.\nNearly half of Canadians are aware of the 988 Crisis Suicide Helpline (45%), with 4% having utilized the service themselves and an additional 8% knowing someone who has.\n\nMental Health Research Canada\nGet the latest updates on new events and funding opportunities.

Recent national surveys found that 2 in 5 Canadians felt that their mental health has been negatively impacted by the economic downturn,Reference2 \u00a0and that 1 in 3 Canadian households have experienced difficulties meeting their financial needs for necessary expenses such as transportation, housing, food and clothing.Reference3\nIn the CMWF survey, more Canadians reported feeling concerned about economic factors than their peers in other countries. These concerns included always or usually being worried or stressed about paying for housing, having enough food and having a safe and clean place to sleep. The proportion of Canadians reporting that they are always or usually stressed about these factors significantly increased from the 2020 survey.\nFinancial concerns remain a negative factor for mental health among Canadians. Food and housing insecurity has been tied to high levels of anxiety.Reference2 \u00a0CMWF survey findings also showed an increase in the proportion of Canadians 18 and older reporting a diagnosis of depression, anxiety or other mental health condition, from 20% in 2016 (CMWF average: 14%) to 29% in 2023 (CMWF average: 25%).\nCanadians\u2019 worries about economic stressors\n\n\nShow text version Hide text version\nText version of graph\nThe proportion of Canadian adults who always or usually felt worried or stressed about having enough food was 4% in 2020 and 10% in 2023, representing a significant increase from 2020.

With mental health services not fully covered by public health insurance, patients predominantly pay out of pocket or with private insurance plans.Reference4 \u00a0Canadians were more likely to cite cost as the reason they did not access mental health services when they needed them (Canada: 15%; CMWF average: 11%), particularly among those previously diagnosed with a mental health condition (34%).\nAdults who did not get mental health services because of the cost\n\n\nShow text version Hide text version\nText version of graph\nThe proportions of adults who did not get mental health services when they needed them during the past 12 months due to cost are as follows: Germany, 3%; the Netherlands, 3%; France, 6%; Sweden, 8%; New Zealand, 10%; CMWF average, 11%; the United Kingdom, 12%; Switzerland, 12%; Canada, 15%; Australia, 18%; and the United States, 26%.

Most in this group were younger than 65, and more than two-thirds had a diagnosed mental health concern (71%). Nearly half reported household income lower than $60,000, while 60% reported having a private insurance plan. Even with an insurance plan, potential barriers to accessing mental health care \u00a0can include benefits coverage limits; out-of-pocket costs for copayments, deductibles and medications; and the ability to take time away from work to receive care.\nHealth care providers can support mental health by addressing stressors and lifestyle factors\nPrimary care providers and other health care professionals can support patients\u2019 mental health by addressing stressors and lifestyle factors. However, fewer than 3 in 10 Canadians reported that a health professional talked with them about things in their lives that caused them worry or stress (Canada: 28%; CMWF average: 28%). Discussing lifestyle factors such as physical exercise, healthy eating and substance use with their care providers also varied, with Canada\u2019s results being very similar to the CMWF average. In the 2022 CMWF survey of primary care physicians, less than half of Canadian physicians reported that they often screen or assess patients for their social needs like housing, financial security and food insecurity.Reference5\nDiscussions about stressors with health care professionals\n\n\nShow text version Hide text version\nText version of graph\nThe proportions of adults who reported that a health care professional talked with them in the past 12 months about things in their life that worry them or cause them stress are as follows: the United States, 40%; Australia, 35%; France, 30%; Germany, 30%; Sweden, 28%; CMWF average, 28%; Canada, 28%; New Zealand, 27%; Switzerland, 25%; the United Kingdom, 21%; and the Netherlands, 18%.

In 2022, about three-quarters of Canadian primary care physicians reported that virtual care allowed them to effectively assess the mental and behavioural health needs of their patients.Reference5 \u00a0Virtual mental health care is not yet common across Canada, with only 1 in 9 Canadians (11%) reporting that they received virtual health care from a mental health professional (CMWF average: 7%); however, both uptake of and satisfaction with virtual mental health services were significantly higher among Canadian adults than among adults in other countries surveyed. Of those who received virtual mental health care, most were very or somewhat satisfied with the care received (Canada: 82%; CMWF average: 74%). Younger adults (19%) and females (14%) were more likely to use virtual mental health care. Nearly 3 in 4 Canadian adults who used virtual mental health care had a diagnosed mental health condition (72%).\nVirtual mental health care may not be appropriate for severe and/or acute mental health conditions, but it can be helpful for patients with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.Reference7Reference8 \u00a0It may have the potential to address barriers to accessing care, and to empower patients to better manage their conditions.Reference9 Further research is needed to understand how to improve equitable access to virtual mental health care in marginalized communities.\nBack to Commonwealth Fund survey, 2023\nReferences\n1.\nBack to Reference 1 in text\nStatistics Canada.

Recent national surveys found that 2 in 5 Canadians felt that their mental health has been negatively impacted by the economic downturn,Reference2 \u00a0and that 1 in 3 Canadian households have experienced difficulties meeting their financial needs for necessary expenses such as transportation, housing, food and clothing.Reference3\nIn the CMWF survey, more Canadians reported feeling concerned about economic factors than their peers in other countries. These concerns included always or usually being worried or stressed about paying for housing, having enough food and having a safe and clean place to sleep. The proportion of Canadians reporting that they are always or usually stressed about these factors significantly increased from the 2020 survey.\nFinancial concerns remain a negative factor for mental health among Canadians. Food and housing insecurity has been tied to high levels of anxiety.Reference2 \u00a0CMWF survey findings also showed an increase in the proportion of Canadians 18 and older reporting a diagnosis of depression, anxiety or other mental health condition, from 20% in 2016 (CMWF average: 14%) to 29% in 2023 (CMWF average: 25%).\nCanadians\u2019 worries about economic stressors\n\n\nShow text version Hide text version\nText version of graph\nThe proportion of Canadian adults who always or usually felt worried or stressed about having enough food was 4% in 2020 and 10% in 2023, representing a significant increase from 2020.

A lower percentage is more desirable.\nThe proportion of Canadian adults who always or usually felt worried or stressed about paying their rent or mortgage was 11% in 2020 and 17% in 2023, representing a significant increase from 2020. The CMWF average was 9% in 2020 and 14% in 2023. Canada\u2019s 2023 proportion of 17% is significantly higher than the 2023 CMWF average of 14%.

A lower percentage is more desirable.\nThe proportion of Canadian adults who always or usually felt worried or stressed about having a stable income was 11% in 2020 and 16% in 2023, representing a significant increase from 2020. The CMWF average was 11% in 2020 and 14% in 2023. Canada\u2019s 2023 proportion of 16% is similar to the 2023 CMWF average of 14%.

With mental health services not fully covered by public health insurance, patients predominantly pay out of pocket or with private insurance plans.Reference4 \u00a0Canadians were more likely to cite cost as the reason they did not access mental health services when they needed them (Canada: 15%; CMWF average: 11%), particularly among those previously diagnosed with a mental health condition (34%).\nAdults who did not get mental health services because of the cost\n\n\nShow text version Hide text version\nText version of graph\nThe proportions of adults who did not get mental health services when they needed them during the past 12 months due to cost are as follows: Germany, 3%; the Netherlands, 3%; France, 6%; Sweden, 8%; New Zealand, 10%; CMWF average, 11%; the United Kingdom, 12%; Switzerland, 12%; Canada, 15%; Australia, 18%; and the United States, 26%.

Most in this group were younger than 65, and more than two-thirds had a diagnosed mental health concern (71%). Nearly half reported household income lower than $60,000, while 60% reported having a private insurance plan. Even with an insurance plan, potential barriers to accessing mental health care \u00a0can include benefits coverage limits; out-of-pocket costs for copayments, deductibles and medications; and the ability to take time away from work to receive care.\nHealth care providers can support mental health by addressing stressors and lifestyle factors\nPrimary care providers and other health care professionals can support patients\u2019 mental health by addressing stressors and lifestyle factors. However, fewer than 3 in 10 Canadians reported that a health professional talked with them about things in their lives that caused them worry or stress (Canada: 28%; CMWF average: 28%). Discussing lifestyle factors such as physical exercise, healthy eating and substance use with their care providers also varied, with Canada\u2019s results being very similar to the CMWF average. In the 2022 CMWF survey of primary care physicians, less than half of Canadian physicians reported that they often screen or assess patients for their social needs like housing, financial security and food insecurity.Reference5\nDiscussions about stressors with health care professionals\n\n\nShow text version Hide text version\nText version of graph\nThe proportions of adults who reported that a health care professional talked with them in the past 12 months about things in their life that worry them or cause them stress are as follows: the United States, 40%; Australia, 35%; France, 30%; Germany, 30%; Sweden, 28%; CMWF average, 28%; Canada, 28%; New Zealand, 27%; Switzerland, 25%; the United Kingdom, 21%; and the Netherlands, 18%.

After all, to report on impact is not just looking at\u00a0past achievements. It is also a promise for the future: the\u00a0pact,\u00a0the commitment, and the hope. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 6 The ability to foster change in mental health is an ongoing commitment, for even when we achieve milestones we must be aware of emerging challenges. That is why the MHCC seeks to truly understand and engage with people who have lived and living experience of mental health and substance use health challenges. Not only are these experiences integrated into our research, planning, and outreach efforts. They make it possible to identify gaps in policy and services that provide our evidence-based research to inform change, training to reduce stigma, and programs to offer life-affirming hope. One example is Roots of Hope, a community-led initiative to reduce suicide rates whose impact is empowering communities and provinces across the country \u2014 most recently, the government of Manitoba.\nCanada is a vast country with many geographic, cultural, linguistic, and economic differences. But no matter what your status, you can be affected by mental health concerns. Just as we all have physical health, we all have mental health \u2014 and it\u2019s something that needs tending. Yet, because doing so can be difficult for many people, the MHCC is part of a global forum of mental health leaders who are tackling challenges related to virtual care implementation and its intersections with artificial intelligence. As critical questions emerge, so is the potential for virtual care to reduce mental health service wait times \u2014 something we saw this year in the Northwest Territories. An MHCC project, implemented in partnership with the territorial government and Stepped Care Solutions, led to a 79 per cent reduction in\u00a0wait times for mental health counselling in the region. The Stepped Care model allows individuals to access mental health services at level with the most effective impact. Each level can then be stepped up or down depending on progress and the nature of the concern. The reductions in wait times involved simplifying intake processes, introducing drop-in counselling sessions, and implementing e-mental health services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 7 The MHCC is also changing the lives of Canadians and communities by increasing mental health literacy and improving access to quality mental health and substance use health supports. Since care needs to be culturally informed to do this well, the commission partnered with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) on a research and pilot program for culturally adapted cognitive behavioural therapy that is improving outcomes for Canadians of South Asian origin with anxiety and depression.\nIn addition, MHCC collaboration across numerous communities regarding the relationship between mental health and cannabis resulted in 40 community-based research projects. Six were led by Indigenous researchers, who provided perspectives on parental cannabis use and child welfare, cannabis retailers in Indigenous communities, and guidance on the interface of cannabis and traditional medicines.\nWe have also been collaborating with Indspire, a\u00a0cross-Canada Indigenous charity that invests in the education of First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis youth and young adults. This initiative focuses on mental health education and resources to support Indigenous students with Indspire\u2019s programs.\nWhile these are truly impactful programs, mental health stigma continues to be a significant issue. We know from work with our research partners that 95 per cent of people with a mental health or substance use disorder were impacted by stigma over the past five years, with the majority reporting feelings of self-stigma and internalizing negative stereotypes.\nThis finding underscores the critical importance of our evidence-based training programs, including those offered through Opening Minds to increase mental health literacy. Since the MHCC was established in 2007, we have trained more than a million people in these innovative evidence-based courses and plan to increase this number significantly.\nTogether, we are actively ensuring that we are equipped to advance policy and program objectives in a sustainable and meaningful manner while creatively increasing our impact.

Since the MHCC launched TWM in 2013, it has developed a series of industry\u2011specific versions of the training by collaborating with a range of\u00a0partners. One of those versions is TWM\u00a0Sport, which was piloted through the foundation with the help of Saskatchewan Roughrider players and coaches, along with a handful of elite athletes in the\u00a0province. Feedback\u00a0from the pilot led to additional improvements to the program.\nDetermined to have more elite football players benefit from the training, the foundation paid to deliver TWM\u00a0Sport to two varsity teams and several junior and women\u2019s teams. To spread its benefits further, the\u00a0foundation also built on its long-standing partnership with the province\u2019s Ministry of Education. For years, the ministry and foundation have partnered on the Game Changers Playbook to give elementary and secondary students evidence-based, curriculum\u2011related mental health and wellness resources. Now, five Roughrider players trained in TWM Sport tour the province to talk about mental health with student groups through the foundation\u2019s Win\u00a0With\u00a0Wellness\u00a0Presentation Series.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 12A Saskatchewan Roughrider team member speaks to students seated at their desks.\n\u201cThe mind is the strongest muscle in your body,\u201d says\u00a0Brayden Lenius, a Saskatchewan Roughrider wide\u00a0receiver who participated in the pilot.\n\u201cYou can develop your mind to become stronger and more resilient. TWM Sport teaches you how to do that.\u201d \u201cLessons from TWM are for everyone \u2014 not just pro athletes,\u201d says Lenius. \u201cTelling schoolchildren about some of the mental health challenges I face, and\u00a0listening to their stories, helps me and helps them.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 13 The MHCC continues to seek like-minded partners to expand and improve the effectiveness of programs like TWM. In\u00a0the end, everyone must recognize that mental health can be nurtured, that help is\u00a0available, and that recovery is expected. TWM Versions Besides different versions for employees and managers in\u00a0Canada, Australia, and the United States, TWM is available for\u00a0specific industry groups.

I went through the group myself and found it beneficial. I know that, as a lived experience person on the team, it has given me the opportunity to use my life experience for good and to make meaning out of what happened. My\u00a0friend Travis also went through the group last year and found it helpful. He unfortunately died by suicide recently, but I think the group bought him the better part of a year.\nI am very grateful that Roots of Hope exists. I am also grateful that the services we provide gave me more time with my friend. This is meaningful work, and I hope to be able to see it through.

After all, to report on impact is not just looking at\u00a0past achievements. It is also a promise for the future: the\u00a0pact,\u00a0the commitment, and the hope. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 6 The ability to foster change in mental health is an ongoing commitment, for even when we achieve milestones we must be aware of emerging challenges. That is why the MHCC seeks to truly understand and engage with people who have lived and living experience of mental health and substance use health challenges. Not only are these experiences integrated into our research, planning, and outreach efforts. They make it possible to identify gaps in policy and services that provide our evidence-based research to inform change, training to reduce stigma, and programs to offer life-affirming hope. One example is Roots of Hope, a community-led initiative to reduce suicide rates whose impact is empowering communities and provinces across the country \u2014 most recently, the government of Manitoba.\nCanada is a vast country with many geographic, cultural, linguistic, and economic differences. But no matter what your status, you can be affected by mental health concerns. Just as we all have physical health, we all have mental health \u2014 and it\u2019s something that needs tending. Yet, because doing so can be difficult for many people, the MHCC is part of a global forum of mental health leaders who are tackling challenges related to virtual care implementation and its intersections with artificial intelligence. As critical questions emerge, so is the potential for virtual care to reduce mental health service wait times \u2014 something we saw this year in the Northwest Territories. An MHCC project, implemented in partnership with the territorial government and Stepped Care Solutions, led to a 79 per cent reduction in\u00a0wait times for mental health counselling in the region. The Stepped Care model allows individuals to access mental health services at level with the most effective impact. Each level can then be stepped up or down depending on progress and the nature of the concern. The reductions in wait times involved simplifying intake processes, introducing drop-in counselling sessions, and implementing e-mental health services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 7 The MHCC is also changing the lives of Canadians and communities by increasing mental health literacy and improving access to quality mental health and substance use health supports. Since care needs to be culturally informed to do this well, the commission partnered with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) on a research and pilot program for culturally adapted cognitive behavioural therapy that is improving outcomes for Canadians of South Asian origin with anxiety and depression.\nIn addition, MHCC collaboration across numerous communities regarding the relationship between mental health and cannabis resulted in 40 community-based research projects. Six were led by Indigenous researchers, who provided perspectives on parental cannabis use and child welfare, cannabis retailers in Indigenous communities, and guidance on the interface of cannabis and traditional medicines.\nWe have also been collaborating with Indspire, a\u00a0cross-Canada Indigenous charity that invests in the education of First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis youth and young adults. This initiative focuses on mental health education and resources to support Indigenous students with Indspire\u2019s programs.\nWhile these are truly impactful programs, mental health stigma continues to be a significant issue. We know from work with our research partners that 95 per cent of people with a mental health or substance use disorder were impacted by stigma over the past five years, with the majority reporting feelings of self-stigma and internalizing negative stereotypes.\nThis finding underscores the critical importance of our evidence-based training programs, including those offered through Opening Minds to increase mental health literacy. Since the MHCC was established in 2007, we have trained more than a million people in these innovative evidence-based courses and plan to increase this number significantly.\nTogether, we are actively ensuring that we are equipped to advance policy and program objectives in a sustainable and meaningful manner while creatively increasing our impact. Work like this changes lives.Michel Rodrigue\u2019s signature.\nMichel Rodrigue President and CEOChuck Bruce\u2019s signature.\nChuck Bruce Board Chair Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 8 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 9 Sporting Mindfulness More than 15,000 schoolchildren across Saskatchewan received mental health training thanks to a ground-breaking partnership between the Mental Health Commission of Canada and\u00a0a\u00a0professional football team. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 10Three female athletes celebrating.\nThe MHCC\u2019s alliance with the Saskatchewan Roughriders also led to a new version of The Working\u00a0Mind (TWM), an evidence-based program to promote mental health and reduce the stigma associated with mental\u00a0illness in the workplace.\n\u201cI\u2019ve long been aware of the mental health training developed and delivered by the MHCC,\u201d says Cindy\u00a0Fuchs, the foundation\u2019s executive director and a recognized leader in Saskatchewan\u2019s not-for-profit sector. \u201cWhen\u00a0I learned about plans to develop a version of TWM for the sports industry, I saw an opportunity for us to work together and serve the greater good.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 11Three male athletes celebrating.\nThe Saskatchewan Roughrider Foundation, the charitable organization affiliated with the Canadian Football League team, has\u00a0been funding community-based education, health, and amateur sports projects for young people since it\u00a0was\u00a0established in 2019.\nDeveloped by clinicians and peers, TWM offers facilitated discussions that focus on work-related mental health topics. Since the MHCC launched TWM in 2013, it has developed a series of industry\u2011specific versions of the training by collaborating with a range of\u00a0partners. One of those versions is TWM\u00a0Sport, which was piloted through the foundation with the help of Saskatchewan Roughrider players and coaches, along with a handful of elite athletes in the\u00a0province. Feedback\u00a0from the pilot led to additional improvements to the program.\nDetermined to have more elite football players benefit from the training, the foundation paid to deliver TWM\u00a0Sport to two varsity teams and several junior and women\u2019s teams. To spread its benefits further, the\u00a0foundation also built on its long-standing partnership with the province\u2019s Ministry of Education. For years, the ministry and foundation have partnered on the Game Changers Playbook to give elementary and secondary students evidence-based, curriculum\u2011related mental health and wellness resources. Now, five Roughrider players trained in TWM Sport tour the province to talk about mental health with student groups through the foundation\u2019s Win\u00a0With\u00a0Wellness\u00a0Presentation Series.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 12A Saskatchewan Roughrider team member speaks to students seated at their desks.\n\u201cThe mind is the strongest muscle in your body,\u201d says\u00a0Brayden Lenius, a Saskatchewan Roughrider wide\u00a0receiver who participated in the pilot.\n\u201cYou can develop your mind to become stronger and more resilient. TWM Sport teaches you how to do that.\u201d \u201cLessons from TWM are for everyone \u2014 not just pro athletes,\u201d says Lenius. \u201cTelling schoolchildren about some of the mental health challenges I face, and\u00a0listening to their stories, helps me and helps them.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 13 The MHCC continues to seek like-minded partners to expand and improve the effectiveness of programs like TWM. In\u00a0the end, everyone must recognize that mental health can be nurtured, that help is\u00a0available, and that recovery is expected. TWM Versions Besides different versions for employees and managers in\u00a0Canada, Australia, and the United States, TWM is available for\u00a0specific industry groups. These include: \u2022 First responders (fire,\u00a0police, paramedics, corrections\u00a0staff) \u2022 Post-secondary students \u2022 Health care \u2022 Legal \u2022 Oral health care \u2022 Sports By the Numbers More than 300,000 people have completed at\u00a0least one version of TWM.\nMore than 1,500 TWM facilitators have\u00a0been trained worldwide.\nMore and more Peer\u2011reviewed studies demonstrate the effectiveness of TWM.1 1 See, for example, Effects of the Anti-stigma Workplace Intervention \u201cWorking Mind\u201d in\u00a0a\u00a0Canadian Health-Care Setting: A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Immediate Versus Delayed Implementation and The Working Mind: A\u00a0Meta\u2011Analysis of a Workplace Mental\u00a0Health and Stigma Reduction Program.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 14 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 15 Taking Root Engaging and empowering individuals and\u00a0communities in suicide prevention The Roots of Hope model builds on community expertise to implement suicide prevention and life promotion initiatives based on five pillars of action and 13 guiding principles.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 16Three adults planting a tree together.\nThe impact of Roots of Hope on individuals and communities continues to deepen. Its\u00a0success is based on sound evidence and an operating model that prioritizes collaboration and independence: Each Roots of Hope community is encouraged to develop and implement the initiatives \u2014 and establish the partnerships \u2014 it considers most appropriate. In many cases, they build on existing programs and services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 17 \u201cGiving back to others through Roots\u00a0of\u00a0Hope has helped to save my life.\u201d \u201cThe launching of an eight-week support group for [suicide] attempt survivors provided a space for them to work through their struggles in a safe space. I went through the group myself and found it beneficial. I know that, as a lived experience person on the team, it has given me the opportunity to use my life experience for good and to make meaning out of what happened. My\u00a0friend Travis also went through the group last year and found it helpful. He unfortunately died by suicide recently, but I think the group bought him the better part of a year.\nI am very grateful that Roots of Hope exists. I am also grateful that the services we provide gave me more time with my friend. This is meaningful work, and I hope to be able to see it through. It\u2019s the only group of its kind in the area \u2014 and by area I\u2019m pretty sure I mean all of Western Canada. Lastly, the suicide prevention-related events that Stony Plain hosts always have good\u00a0turnouts, and I think the public is starting to be able to speak more openly about it.\u201d Wesley Jones Roots of Hope community Stony Plain, Alberta Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 18 \u201cWe are network of 65 volunteers trained in ground-based search and rescue. Many of the people we search for don\u2019t want to be found, usually because they are experiencing a mental\u2011health crisis. These now account for about 75 per cent of our searches. In many cases, the person is contemplating suicide, and time is of the essence. Partnering with Roots of Hope improves our ability to find and rescue people in crisis. The partnership also improves the mental health of our volunteers, who are now more resilient.\u201d Tina Brown Planning Section Chief Colchester Ground Search and Rescue Colchester County, Nova Scotia \u201cA big reason that members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community experience higher rates of both mental illness and suicide ideation is social stigma, particularly in rural and remote communities. Under our partnership with Roots of Hope, two members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community in each of Nova Scotia\u2019s four health-care zones have been trained to deliver SafeTALK suicide-prevention courses. Hundreds of at-risk people, along with their friends and families, will benefit. Roots of Hope is a catalyst \u2014 the extra ingredient that inspires tangible progress.\u201d Tyler Colbourne Executive Director Healthy Minds Cooperative Nova Scotia Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 19Two youths at a race.\nBy the Numbers 2019 eight communities 2021 11 more Today 18 communities, three provinces, and one territory Roots of Hope is based on\u00a0community expertise To increase the impact of their efforts, Roots of Hope community coalition forge partnerships with a variety of local organizations. Across the country, there are more than a hundred Roots of Hope partners, including universities, high schools, businesses, media outlets, long-term care homes, workplaces, hospitals, municipalities, school boards, police forces, libraries, churches, and Friendship Centres.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 20 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 21 Wise Heads on Young\u00a0Shoulders The earlier, the better. That\u2019s the best way to summarize the\u00a0research on\u00a0how to foster mental health and prevent mental\u00a0illness. The\u00a0sooner you know, the more likely you are\u00a0to\u00a0seek help and help others. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 22Five students working on an assignment together.\nHEADSTRONG helps grade 6 to 12 students raise mental health awareness, challenge\u00a0stigma, and\u00a0promote mental wellness and early help seeking. Informed by five years of research, and developed in collaboration with educators and students, HEADSTRONG uses a proven two\u2011step process: Students from multiple schools are initially brought together to attend a summit; afterwards,\u00a0groups of students in each school design and\u00a0implement a range of\u00a0activities and initiatives based on\u00a0what they\u2019ve learned. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 23 Cape Breton-Victoria Regional\u00a0Centre\u00a0for Education in Nova Scotia, one of the first HEADSTRONG school boards, held its inaugural summit\u00a0in\u00a02014. Since then, about 7,500 students at 16 middle and\u00a0secondary\u00a0schools\u00a0have participated in HEADSTRONG.\nComments from middle school participants \u201c. . . inspired me to be brave, to speak up for my opinions and thoughts.\u201d \u201c. . . feels like a safe space where you don\u2019t have to be scared to talk about your feelings!\u201d \u201c. . . helped me to understand that my mental health is just as important as my physical health, and that I don\u2019t always have to be so hard on myself.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not scared to talk about problems or\u00a0mental health issues anymore.\u201d \u201cIt made me realize that I am in control of my life. I loved it and will be back next year.\u201d Comments from secondary school participants \u201c. . . inspired me to reach out about my struggle to others.\u201d \u201c. . . a platform to encourage others to help themselves and talk about how we can make a positive change for people who struggle with mental health issues.\u201d \u201c. . . has given me a community to be in and a cause to be part of. I enjoy helping out around the school.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 24 Halton District School Board (near Burlington, Ontario) launched HEADSTRONG in eight schools in\u00a02022 to\u00a0complement its existing mental health programming. Its success inspired\u00a032\u00a0Halton\u00a0District schools to follow suit. Comments from middle school participants \u201cIt has opened my eyes to the amount of stigma that surrounds those with mental illnesses.\u201d \u201cI now feel braver about speaking up for others, and I want help people feel brave like that, too.\u201d \u201cI now look at mental illness in a new way.\u201d \u201c. . . really changed the way I thought about mental health. It taught me that mental health was\u00a0really important and can actually kill people if they don\u2019t show their emotions.\u201d Comment from secondary school participant \u201cIt has inspired to reach out significantly more than before. My peers and I can now have an open discussion about mental health.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 25 By the Numbers Since HEADSTRONG was launched in 2014 . . .\n202 summits across Canada (162 in-person, 40 virtual) 1,200+ schools 20,000+ students During the 2022\u201323 school year . . .\n21 summits (4 in-person, 17 virtual) 153 schools 1,744 students Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 26 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 27 A Step Ahead Northwest Territories (NWT) residents can now benefit from Stepped Care 2.0\u00a9 (SC2.0), an innovative approach to delivering mental wellness and substance use health services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 28 With the help of a counsellor (or on their own), service users can identify and access the\u00a0supports and services they feel are most appropriate \u2014 from informal (e-mental health apps, peer support) to formal (one-on-one counselling), which can be adjusted as\u00a0a\u00a0person\u2019s needs and circumstances change. \u201cWhen you are broken and mentally drained, and decide to ask for help, you are hopeful that there may be a light at the end of the tunnel. You want to know you are not alone and can overcome your struggles. You seek assurance that, with help, you can improve your mental health and lead a \u201cnormal\u201d life. Thankfully, within a Stepped\u00a0Care 2.0 system, people are provided with a variety of\u00a0care options to meet their own\u00a0needs.\u201d NWT resident who accessed\u00a0support Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 29 In March 2020, the NWT government began implementing SC2.0, in partnership with the Mental\u00a0Health Commission of Canada (MHCC), Stepped\u00a0Care Solutions and the NWT\u2019s Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Advisory Group. Through consultations with\u00a0the community, care providers, and administrators, the partners overhauled service delivery processes and transformed the system. This\u00a0work enabled the government to integrate SC2.0 into its Community Counselling Program and offer diverse care options while significantly reducing or eliminating\u00a0wait\u2011lists.\nSC2.0 comprises a series of increasingly intensive steps or levels of support and service. From a wide range of\u00a0available choices, individuals and families can make informed decisions about the care that best suits their needs and preferences. For instance, they can access relevant information anonymously, get support from an e-mental health app, join a support group, engage with cultural or land-based programs, or access one-on-one counselling, among other\u00a0options.\nThe Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Advisory Group includes residents from across the NWT. The\u00a0group helped co-design SC2.0 in the NWT and continues to provide advice and wisdom rooted in lived and living expertise with mental\u00a0wellness and substance use health. Under SC2.0, NWT residents can enjoy free access to several e-mental health services at the time most convenient to them.\n\u2022 Breathing Room\u2122 \u2014 self-guided support to help youth reduce stress, anxiety, and depression \u2022 Strongest Families Institute \u2014 coaching programs for children, youth, adults, and families experiencing mild-to-moderate mental health and\u00a0behavioural\u00a0concerns \u2022 Edgewood Health Network Wagon \u2014 addictions\u00a0recovery aftercare support Within SC2.0, the NWT also promotes and partners with\u00a0several other initiatives, including Wellness\u00a0Together Canada and the 7 Cups, Root\u2019d, and\u00a0Stronger Minds apps.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 30 \u201cThey were very understanding, good to\u00a0work with, and worked around my schedule. The\u00a0drop-in was good because things happen, and you could email and cancel without any costs to me. Without\u00a0the program, I don\u2019t know\u00a0how I\u00a0could navigate the whole system.\u201d NWT Community Counselling Program\u00a0(CCP) user \u201cIt was a non-judgmental environment and open to all my concerns. . . . The\u00a0counsellors were very flexible and good to work with. [They] worked out the\u00a0time of\u00a0day and what worked for my life.\u201d NWT Community Counselling Program (CCP) user Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 31 \u201cIt was great to connect with people across the country who are also in recovery, so\u00a0that\u00a0you can relate to people who are maybe going through some of the same things you are. It certainly gives you an accountability to other people who are going through a very similar thing. It also helps you to stay connected. And such an important part of recovery is connection. I\u00a0would recommend the [Wagon] app \u2014 any way that we can help people to stay sober and stay in recovery is\u00a0a\u00a0positive thing for the territory.\u201d Natasha Kulikowski, Inuvik, Wagon app user (Edgewood Health Network) \u201cI look forward to my weekly session, not\u00a0only for\u00a0the chance to share in\u00a0a\u00a0safe space but to gain tools that further improve my sobriety journey and influence\u00a0the rest of my life.\u201d Wagon app user (Edgewood Health Network) Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 32 A Caregiver\u2019s Perspective \u201cStepped Care 2.0 is the way my practice has evolved naturally. It\u2019s a relief and validates how [we] already practised. It\u2019s so natural, it fits so well.\u201d NWT Community Counselling Program (CCP) service provider \u201cStepped Care 2.0 is ideal for youth because they\u2019re often not receptive to coming into an\u00a0office, and they want help when they need it. Early in my career, a young person seeking help had to go through a nurse or doctor. Now there\u2019s a wealth of readily accessible tools and strategies that can teach them how to regulate their feelings and anxieties.\u201d Nancy McInnis, Child and Youth Counsellor, Mental Health and Addictions Services, NWT Health and Social Services Authority-Beaufort Delta Region Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 33 Evaluation and next steps In 2023, a comprehensive evaluation consisting of service user surveys, reviews of focus-group sessions, and service provider reports found that SC2.0 had significantly increased access to services and produced positive outcomes for many service users and providers across the NWT. The evaluation also identified gaps, lessons learned, and areas for improvement to guide the way forward. For instance, it called for more community engagement and enhanced culturally safe programs to integrate Indigenous approaches to care and wellness, and greater efforts to deepen service user and provider understanding for improved access to quality care.\nTo access the full report, follow this link or go to mentalhealthcommission.ca/resource/ stepped\u2011care\u2011nwt/ The MHCC has also helped to implement SC2.0 in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.

So far this year, the United States has already experienced 25 weather and climate disasters that each resulted in more than a billion dollars of damages, costing hundreds of lives and more than $73 billion total. For some extreme weather events like Hurricane Idalia and the fires in Hawai\u2018i, the full cost is not yet completely known. Actions taken by President Biden through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS for America Act are helping Americans prepare for, and respond to extreme weather events, as well as a spectrum of other climate-related challenges.\nClimate disasters that occur in one region of the United States can have cascading or compounding effects in other regions. For example, wildfires in one region can worsen air quality and health in other regions. When hazards occur in different regions but at the same time, such as the simultaneous megafires that burned across multiple western states and record back-to-back Atlantic hurricanes in 2020, these compounding disasters can put unprecedented demand on federal emergency response resources. Climate change also interacts with other stressors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and social inequities, which can multiply harm and further increase demand for resources that are needed when responding to disasters. This is particularly true for overburdened communities. These interactions can lead to cascading impacts that cross state and national borders. For example, both gradual changes in average climate conditions (e.g., shifts in temperature and precipitation) and extreme events (e.g., floods, droughts, and wildfire) can shock the global food supply chain and lead to food insecurity, geopolitical instability, and mass migration. These cascading and compounding impacts affect people\u2019s well-being, our economy, and our national security.\nIn addition to federal action, state, local, Tribal, and territorial efforts to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions have expanded in every U.S. region. Many of these actions advance climate mitigation and adaptation at the same time. Effective climate action has prioritized equitable and inclusive planning processes to help ensure that affected communities can participate in decision-making. Across the country, mitigation and adaptation efforts that build upon community strengths and center local and Indigenous Knowledge systems improve resilience.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Fifth National Climate Assessment includes ten regional chapters that assess climate risks and describe challenges, opportunities, and success stories for managing those risks. In addition, the new NCA Atlas allows users to explore localized climate projections to inform climate resilience, adaptation, and mitigation efforts in their communities.\nClimate Change Impacts in Regions Across America\nNortheast \u2014 Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia\nThis region is experiencing increases in the frequency of extreme weather events and other climate-driven changes, including intense rainstorms, warmer ocean temperatures, and rapid sea level rise. For example, the amount of rain that falls during the heaviest downpours has increased by approximately 60% in the Northeast since the 1950s\u2014the largest increase in the United States. Many regional climate impacts, including extreme heat and flooding, disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of color. The region is responding with mitigation and adaptation efforts, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative\u2014a market-based program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions; eight state laws requiring emissions reductions of at least 80% by 2050; and new financing options, such as grants, loans, or tax assessments, that improve the capacity of households, communities, and businesses to build climate resilience. Cities, states, and Tribes are implementing climate action plans with innovative approaches that embrace inclusive and equitable processes. For example, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\u2019s Climate Action Plan was developed with multi-year civic engagement opportunities, focuses on benefits of climate action that improve equity, and tracks progress through annual reports. The city\u2019s 2022 stormwater code requires any new development that could affect stormwater runoff to plan for projected increases in heavy rainfall under climate change, rather than building to historical rainfall amounts. Read more in Chapter 21: Northeast.\nSoutheast \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia\nThis region\u2019s growing population faces rising sea levels and increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves that lead to greater risks of wildfires. Climate stressors, including drought and extreme heat, are expected to disproportionately affect communities of color and low-income communities who struggle to afford energy bills, especially for air conditioning. Due to increasing energy demands and extreme weather events, there is a growing number of power outages in the region that affect more than 1,000 residents for longer than an hour. This is especially true during the warmer months that place some communities at a higher risk of heat exposure and heat-related illness due to a lack of access to air conditioning. While adaptation efforts tend to be concentrated in wealthier coastal and metropolitan areas, there have been notable advancements in climate actions throughout the region. Following repeated flooding from multiple hurricanes, measures to reduce flood risk in Princeville, North Carolina, include buyouts, elevating homes, and building housing that meets local flood standards. In Orlando, Florida, the city government and businesses are adopting commercial building energy efficiency requirements and a community-wide commitment to 100% renewable energy to advance the decarbonization of local buildings. As the largest rental car market in the world, the metropolitan area has also adopted new electric vehicle readiness policies. Read more in Chapter 22: Southeast.\nU.S. Caribbean \u2014 Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands\nWarmer air and ocean temperatures are leading to intense hurricanes and increasingly powerful storms. The number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes is projected to increase as the climate crisis worsens. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused more than $2.3 billion in losses and damages to crops and infrastructure, which represented a reduction of about 80% of the main island\u2019s total agricultural value. Paired with rising sea levels and other climate changes, these impacts are harming human health\u2014particularly in underserved communities; degrading, disrupting, and undermining the functions of ecosystems, especially in coastal zones; and threatening the region\u2019s water and food security. Critical infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is at risk of flooding due to sea level rise and heavy rainfall. Changes in precipitation and extreme events are expected to increase outbreaks of disease and can also disrupt vital local services, such as health care and water quality management. Across the region, many community-based organizations have taken actions to advance adaptation, social transformation, and sustainable development. Effective adaptation to support resilience in the region could be enhanced by decentralization of energy and water systems, improved governance and funding, and stronger partnerships across the Caribbean region and the U.S. mainland. For example, decentralized household solar systems and rainwater harvesting improve resilience by providing power and water during interruptions to the centralized utility grid or public water system. Read more in Chapter 23: U.S. Caribbean.\nMidwest \u2014 Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin\nThe Midwest is facing rising temperatures, drought, extreme precipitation, and other climate changes. These changes affect Midwestern ecosystems, agriculture, infrastructure, and human health, as well as livelihoods and cultural practices that rely on natural resources, including ice fishing or the harvesting of local plant species. Since 1980, the Midwest has incurred more than $49 billion in economic damages due to flooding. Although average corn and soybean yields have increased in recent decades, both flooding and extreme droughts significantly decreased corn yields in some locations and in some years by up to 37%. Over the past decade, clean energy production in the region has grown by more than 275% and has reduced carbon emissions from the energy sector. Communities, local and state governments, and businesses are embracing adaptation approaches that include green infrastructure, climate-smart agriculture, and collaboration with Tribes on land management issues to improve climate outcomes for all residents. For example, climate-smart agricultural approaches have the potential to increase production, improve resilience to climate-related risks, and yield additional benefits for Midwestern ecosystems. An innovative finance and construction approach being used by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewer District has reduced the number of annual combined sewer overflow events over the last five years. Using a community-based public-private partnership, Milwaukee is now looking to add an additional 20 million gallons of green stormwater infrastructure capture capacity. Read more in Chapter 24: Midwest.\nNorthern Great Plains \u2014 Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming\nThe Northern Great Plains are experiencing unprecedented extremes, including severe droughts, floods, and wildfires. Climate change can affect floods along the Missouri River, like the ones in 2011 and 2019 that caused evacuations, costly damages, and interstate closures. With additional global warming, the region would expect to see some of the highest increases in annual flooding damage costs in the United States. At the same time, drought is projected to increase, with moderate to extreme droughts occurring as much as 20% more frequently by the end of the century. These changes threaten economic sectors, such as agriculture and recreation, and affect the mental and physical health of residents. The region\u2019s share of employees working in fossil fuel extraction is four times greater than in the nation as a whole. Shifts in energy demand, production, and policy will affect energy-related livelihoods for the region\u2019s residents, especially rural, Indigenous, and low-income immigrant populations, as opportunities in the clean energy field expand. Renewable energy production is on the rise in the Northern Great Plains, with the region supplying 12% of the total U.S. electricity generation from wind, biomass, and solar sources. In addition, the region is home to a number of Tribes who are leading the nation\u2019s clean energy transition by installing clean energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower. Read more in Chapter 25: Northern Great Plains.\nSouthern Great Plains \u2014 Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas\nIncreasing frequency and intensity of precipitation, warmer ocean temperatures, extreme heat, and rising sea levels are degrading the air, lands, and waters that people in the Southern Great Plains rely on for economic, recreational, and cultural activities. Annual precipitation has increased across most of the region, with Texas enduring its five wettest months on record between 2000 and 2021. By contrast, the region also experienced severe to exceptional drought for significant portions of the years between 2010 and 2022. Between 2018 and 2022, 52 individual billion-dollar climate-related disasters affected all or part of the region. By 2050, annual average temperatures are projected to exceed historical record levels in all three states. These impacts compound existing burdens on disadvantaged communities that have the fewest resources to prepare and adapt to climate change. Communities are adapting through nature-based solutions, reliance on Indigenous and local knowledge, and resilient infrastructure that enhances public health and the region\u2019s economy. In 2020, Oklahoma City produced its first sustainability plan to address climate change. Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas, Texas, adopted plans that included both mitigation and adaptation actions and have started to address local equity issues. Throughout the Southern Great Plains, a major shift in energy generation from fossil fuels toward renewables is underway, with the region accounting for 42% of national wind-generated electricity in 2022. This shift in the demand for clean energy is reducing emissions and creating new jobs and cleaner air in the region. Read more in Chapter 26: Southern Great Plains.\nNorthwest \u2014 Idaho, Oregon, Washington\nHigher temperatures are leading to declining snowpack, melting glaciers, and rising sea levels. These changes, combined with increasing risks of flooding, wildfires, and other climate hazards, threaten human health, ecosystems, infrastructure, and industries. For example, the record-breaking Pacific Northwest heatwave of June 2021 led to more than 1,400 heat-related deaths, a subsequent severe wildfire season, significant losses of economically important fishery species, and total damages exceeding $38.5 billion. Impacts on the Northwest\u2019s economy will have cascading effects on livelihoods and well-being of residents. For instance, snow-based recreational industries, such as skiing, have already lost revenue due to a decrease in snow days per calendar year. In parts of the Cascade Range, the snow season is projected to decrease by nearly half by the end of the century. In response to these changes, local governments, Tribes, labor unions, and community groups across the region are adopting policies and programs that support a just transition to a low-carbon future. State and local climate policies in the Northwest are prioritizing climate response strategies that recognize the importance of climate justice, such as subsidizing adaptation, redistributing benefits, and reducing harm to frontline communities. The Quinault Indian Nation is adapting to accelerated loss of land caused by sea level rise, flooding, and erosion along the central coast of Washington State by reacquiring fractionated land and relocating housing and key facilities from their traditional village site to a newly developed site at higher elevation. Read more in Chapter 27: Northwest.\nSouthwest \u2014 Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah\nClimate change is threatening water resources, increasing challenges to food and fiber production, and compromising human health in the Southwest through drought, wildfire, intense precipitation, sea level rise, and marine heatwaves. Since 2018, 31 climate- and weather-related disasters that have each resulted in more than a billion dollars in damages have affected the Southwest, resulting in more than 700 deaths and estimated damages totaling $67.3 billion. Climate-driven changes to infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries, and other economic sectors are impacting some communities disproportionately. These communities include farmers and ranchers, especially Hispanic, women, and migrant farmworkers; food-insecure households; Indigenous Peoples facing water access challenges; and coastal communities that are reliant on a declining population of traditional fish species. In response, state and local municipalities across the Southwest have implemented adaptive water governance and management approaches. After more than 22 years of historic drought, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation declared the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River in August 2021. The federal governments of the United States and Mexico, the seven U.S. Colorado River basin states, and Indigenous Peoples are developing a range of adaptation pathways and solutions to enhance long-standing collaboration on the Colorado River, including modeling the impact of more extreme climate change scenarios on water resources in the basin. Efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are also being implemented throughout the region. For example, the Phoenix, Arizona Climate Action Plan states that the city is on track to meet its goal of 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Read more in Chapter 28: Southwest.\nAlaska\nAlaska is warming two to three times faster than the global average, with increases in annual average temperatures since 1971 as high as 6.2\u00b0F in northern Alaska. A 2019 summer heatwave brought record-high temperatures to southern and Interior Alaska, with daily high temperatures exceeding normal by more than 20\u00b0F. The Alaska snowfall season is projected to shorten and snowpack is projected to decrease significantly in the southern and western parts of the state. Warming temperatures, thawing permafrost, and other climate-related changes are damaging ecosystems, disrupting cultural practices, harming fisheries and other livelihoods, exacerbating health disparities, and placing critical infrastructure at risk. Many Alaskans, particularly Alaska Native Peoples, depend on natural resources and have a distinct connection to and understanding of the natural environment. While these communities foster self-reliance and resilience in light of a changing climate, geographical isolation and distance from health care and other services leave many people vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. In recent years, Alaska has emerged as a leader of climate adaptation initiatives in the Arctic, many of which have been implemented by regional entities and municipal, community, and Tribal governments. For example, to address climate threats to traditional foods, the Chugach Regional Resources Commission, an inter-Tribal fish and wildlife commission in Alaska, is integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Western scientific methods in its adaptation efforts, including weekly water sampling for harmful algal blooms, kelp farming, and restoring clam populations. Community renewable energy initiatives like Thermalize Juneau and the Solarize initiatives in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Kenai, Mat-Su, and Palmer help residential and commercial property owners install solar capacity.

By 2050, fisheries catch are projected to decline by 40% compared to the early 2000s. These climate changes impair access to clean water and healthy food, undermine human health, threaten cultural resources and the built environment, exacerbate inequities, disrupt economic activity, and damage diverse ecosystems across the region. Strategies are being developed and implemented across the region to revitalize healthier traditional food systems, resulting in more just access to food. Subsistence-based food system practices have sustained Pacific Island peoples for millennia and have aided in recoveries from natural disasters such as typhoons and tsunamis. Other promising fisheries adaptations include establishing networks of marine protected areas to preserve coastal resources, safeguarding fish habitats from pollution runoff, and restoring traditional fishpond mariculture. To help mitigate climate change, the Kaua\u02bbi Island Utility Cooperative achieved a nearly 70% renewable portfolio standard in 2021, and the island is sometimes 100% renewably powered during midday hours. Meanwhile, U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands plan to use blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves and seagrasses, to offset emissions while also protecting coastal infrastructure.

This is the first statistically significant annual increase in real median household income since 2019. The official poverty rate fell 0.4 percentage points, to 11.1%, in 2023. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) rate in 2023 was 12.9%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points from 2022. Meanwhile, 92.0% of the U.S. population had health insurance coverage for all or part of 2023, not statistically different from 2022. An estimated 26.4 million or 8.0% of people did not have health insurance at any point during 2023, according to the 2024 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC), also not statistically different from the previous year.\nThese findings come from three Census Bureau reports:\u00a0Income in the United States: 2023; Poverty in the United States: 2023; and\u00a0Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2023. While the official poverty measure is based on the concept of money income, which is pretax and does not include tax credits, the SPM is a post-tax and transfer poverty measure. The SPM provides an alternative way of measuring poverty in the United States and serves as an additional indicator of economic well-being. The Census Bureau has published poverty estimates using the SPM annually since 2011 in collaboration with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nFor consistency with past reports, the income estimates in the \u201cIncome in the United States: 2023\u201d report are based on the concept of money income. Appendix B of the income report provides post-tax estimates of median household income and income inequality metrics.\nAll three reports are based on data from the CPS ASEC. The\u00a0Current Population Survey\u00a0(CPS), sponsored jointly by the\u00a0Census Bureau\u00a0and\u00a0BLS, is conducted every month and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the U.S. population. It is used to calculate monthly unemployment rate estimates. Supplements are added in most months. The CPS ASEC \u2014 conducted in February, March and April \u2014 is designed to provide annual, national estimates of income, poverty and health insurance estimates, collecting information about job status, income and health insurance coverage during the prior calendar year.\nAlthough the 2024 ASEC was collected using standard procedures, response rates are still lower than they were before the pandemic. The response rate for the CPS basic household survey declined from 68.9% in March 2023 to 67.2% in March 2024.\nSince the response rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, which were regularly above 80%, it is important to examine how respondents differ from nonrespondents, as this difference could affect the accuracy of the estimates. For more details on how sample difference and the associated nonresponse bias impact income and official poverty estimates, refer to the Research Matters blog, \u201cUsing Administrative Data to Evaluate Nonresponse Bias in the 2024 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement.\u201d\nIncome \nIncome estimates are based on the concept of money income and do not account for the value of in-kind transfers. They are pretax, unless otherwise indicated.\n\u00a0\nThe female-to-male earnings ratio compares the median earnings of women working full-time, year-round to the median earnings of men working full-time, year-round.\nPost-tax income is defined as money income net of federal and state taxes and credits, payroll taxes (FICA) and temporary cash payments administered by tax agencies like rebates or stimulus payments. Appendix B of the income report compares household median income and inequality measures based on post-tax income.\nPoverty\nAs defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Statistical Poverty Directive 14 and updated for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, the weighted average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2023 was $30,900 (Refer to <www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html> for the complete set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition).\u00a0\nThe SPM extends the official poverty measure by accounting for several government programs that are designed to assist low-income families but are not included in official poverty measure calculations. The SPM also accounts for geographic variation in housing expenses when calculating the poverty thresholds and includes federal and state taxes, work expenses, and medical expenses. The SPM does not replace the official poverty measure; however, it does provide a different metric of economic well-being that includes resources from government programs and tax credits to low-income families.\nHealth Insurance\nThe CPS ASEC asks people about health insurance coverage during the previous calendar year. People are considered insured if they were covered by any type of health insurance for part or all of the previous calendar year. People are considered uninsured if, for the entire year, they were not covered by any type of insurance. Among the findings:\nRegional estimates are available for income, poverty and health insurance coverage in each respective report. Tables showing state-level poverty and SPM rates using three-year averages are available in the press kit.\nThe CPS ASEC is subject to sampling and nonsampling errors. All comparisons made here and in each respective report have been tested and found to be statistically significant at the 90% confidence level, unless otherwise noted.\nAdditional information on the source of the data and accuracy of the income, poverty and health insurance estimates is available at <https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/techdocs/cpsmar24.pdf>.\n\n###\nShare\nContact\nPatricia Ramos\nPublic Information Office\n301-763-3030 or\n877-861-2010 (U.S. and Canada only)\npio@census.gov\nTop\nReceive Updates\nTo sign up for updates please enter your email address.\nStay Current\nAmerica Counts\nDirector\u2019s Blog\nDeputy Director\u2019s Blog\nRandom Samplings\nResearch Matters\nStay Connected\nContact\nSupport\nJobs\nFollow\nMeasuring America's People, Places, and Economy\n",

This ratio compares family income to a poverty threshold based on the age and number of family members.\nPeople are classified as being in poverty if their family income is less than the poverty threshold. Family resources may determine the ability to afford private health insurance, and families below certain thresholds may qualify for public health insurance, such as Medicaid.\nAge may also factor into individuals\u2019 access to health insurance coverage and type.\nChildren under age 19 may have health coverage through a variety of sources, including a parent\u2019s private plan or public programs like Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nAdults ages 19 to 64 generally have lower coverage rates than those under age 19 and adults age 65 and older. That\u2019s because their coverage is often directly tied to employment. They do not qualify for programs intended for children and only qualify for public programs under specific medical or income-level circumstances.\nHealth Insurance Coverage by Age and Income-to-Poverty Ratio\nFrom 2020 to 2023, the share of children under 19 and working-age adults ages 19 to 64 with health coverage differed depending on income and poverty levels.\nAmong those who lived below the poverty level:\n\nMost children under 19 and working-age adults had public insurance. In each year, over three-quarters of children under 19 and about half of working-age adults in poverty had public coverage.\nThe uninsured rate of children under 19 in poverty ranged from 8.3% to 10.3% between 2020 and 2023.\nAbout a quarter of working-age adults in poverty were uninsured each year between 2020 and 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong those living in families with incomes between 100% and 399% of poverty thresholds:\n\nMore than half of children under 19 and working-age adults had private insurance.\nThe percentage of children under 19 with public insurance rose from 42.3% in 2020 to 45% in 2023.\nAbout a quarter of working-age adults had public insurance from 2020 to 2023.\nThe uninsured rate among children under 19 dipped between 2020 and 2022 from 7.0% to 6.1% and was 6.7% in 2023.\nThe uninsured rate for working-age adults fell from 17.3% in 2020 to 15.2% in 2022, increasing to 16.1% in 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong those in families with incomes in the highest income-to-poverty ratio group (at or above 400% of poverty):\n\nOver 90% of children under 19 and working-age adults had private insurance.\nThe share of children under 19 with public insurance rose from 5.9% in 2020 to 6.8% in 2023.\nThe share of working-age adults with public insurance rose from 5.2% in 2020 to 6% in 2023 while their uninsured rate fell from 4.5% to 4% during this period.\n\n\n\nDefinitions and more information on confidentiality protection and sampling and nonsampling error are available in the\u00a0technical documentation.\nAll comparative statements in this article have undergone statistical testing and, unless otherwise noted, are statistically significant at the 10% significance level.\nLisa Bunch and Halelujha Ketema are survey statisticians and Katherine Keisler-Starkey is an economist in the Census Bureau\u2019s Health and Disability Statistics Branch.\nThis article was filed under:\nAge\nData Equity\nHealth\nHealth Insurance\nIncome and Poverty\nPopulation\nRelated Statistics\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts Story America Counts: Stories about Health Insurance Stories featured behind the numbers for Health Insurance.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts: Stories about Income & Poverty\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) The CPS is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts Story Data Equity Stories We feature stories on various topics such as families, housing, employment, business, education, the economy, emergency management, and population.\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nOur email newsletter is sent out on the day we publish a story.

This ratio compares family income to a poverty threshold based on the age and number of family members.\nPeople are classified as being in poverty if their family income is less than the poverty threshold. Family resources may determine the ability to afford private health insurance, and families below certain thresholds may qualify for public health insurance, such as Medicaid.\nAge may also factor into individuals\u2019 access to health insurance coverage and type.\nChildren under age 19 may have health coverage through a variety of sources, including a parent\u2019s private plan or public programs like Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nAdults ages 19 to 64 generally have lower coverage rates than those under age 19 and adults age 65 and older. That\u2019s because their coverage is often directly tied to employment. They do not qualify for programs intended for children and only qualify for public programs under specific medical or income-level circumstances.\nHealth Insurance Coverage by Age and Income-to-Poverty Ratio\nFrom 2020 to 2023, the share of children under 19 and working-age adults ages 19 to 64 with health coverage differed depending on income and poverty levels.\nAmong those who lived below the poverty level:\n\nMost children under 19 and working-age adults had public insurance. In each year, over three-quarters of children under 19 and about half of working-age adults in poverty had public coverage.\nThe uninsured rate of children under 19 in poverty ranged from 8.3% to 10.3% between 2020 and 2023.\nAbout a quarter of working-age adults in poverty were uninsured each year between 2020 and 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong those living in families with incomes between 100% and 399% of poverty thresholds:\n\nMore than half of children under 19 and working-age adults had private insurance.\nThe percentage of children under 19 with public insurance rose from 42.3% in 2020 to 45% in 2023.\nAbout a quarter of working-age adults had public insurance from 2020 to 2023.\nThe uninsured rate among children under 19 dipped between 2020 and 2022 from 7.0% to 6.1% and was 6.7% in 2023.\nThe uninsured rate for working-age adults fell from 17.3% in 2020 to 15.2% in 2022, increasing to 16.1% in 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong those in families with incomes in the highest income-to-poverty ratio group (at or above 400% of poverty):\n\nOver 90% of children under 19 and working-age adults had private insurance.\nThe share of children under 19 with public insurance rose from 5.9% in 2020 to 6.8% in 2023.\nThe share of working-age adults with public insurance rose from 5.2% in 2020 to 6% in 2023 while their uninsured rate fell from 4.5% to 4% during this period.\n\n\n\nDefinitions and more information on confidentiality protection and sampling and nonsampling error are available in the\u00a0technical documentation.\nAll comparative statements in this article have undergone statistical testing and, unless otherwise noted, are statistically significant at the 10% significance level.\nLisa Bunch and Halelujha Ketema are survey statisticians and Katherine Keisler-Starkey is an economist in the Census Bureau\u2019s Health and Disability Statistics Branch.\nThis article was filed under:\nAge\nData Equity\nHealth\nHealth Insurance\nIncome and Poverty\nPopulation\nRelated Statistics\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts Story America Counts: Stories about Health Insurance Stories featured behind the numbers for Health Insurance.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts: Stories about Income & Poverty\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) The CPS is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts Story Data Equity Stories We feature stories on various topics such as families, housing, employment, business, education, the economy, emergency management, and population.\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nOur email newsletter is sent out on the day we publish a story.

      "August 2024 DATA POINT 1 HP-2024-17 National Uninsured Rate at 8.2 Percent in the First Quarter of 2024 Newly released data from the National Health Interview Survey indicate a statistically insignificant change in the uninsured rate for the first quarter of 2024. KEY POINTS \u2022 According to newly released data from the National Health Interview Survey, in Q1 2024 the national uninsured rate for all ages was 8.2 percent, which corresponds to 27.1 million individuals. \u2022 Quarter-to-quarter changes in the national uninsured rate since the first quarter of 2023 are not statistically significant. The Q1 2024 rate is 1.5 percentage points lower than the uninsured rate for 2020, a difference which is statistically significant. \u2022 An estimated 11.5 percent of adults ages 18-64 were uninsured in Q1 2024. This rate is slightly higher than the rate for 2023, but 3 percentage points lower than the rate as of Q4 2020. \u2022 The uninsured rate for children has varied less over time. In Q1 2024, 5.2 percent of children under age 18 were uninsured, again slightly higher than the rate for 2023, but 1.2 percentage points lower than the rate as of Q4 2020. \u2022 Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the percentage of adults ages 18-64 with private coverage increased by nearly 3 percentage points. This change was driven by a significant increase exchange-based private coverage. The estimated number of non-elderly adults with exchange-based coverage went up by over 4 million. \u2022 The percentage of children reporting private coverage was slightly lower in Q1 2024 compared to a year prior, though the difference was not statistically significant. \u2022 Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the percentage of non-elderly adults with public coverage decreased by 3.4 percentage points. The percentage of children with public coverage declined by 2.7 percentage points over that period. INTRODUCTION This Data Point is part of a series of briefs that report on changes in health insurance coverage using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The most recent data are for the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. The data reflect changes in coverage during the first year of states returning to regular eligibility renewals in Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as well as record increases in enrollment in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Marketplaces.1 In Q1 2024, the estimated uninsured rate for the full population is 8.2 percent, which corresponds to 27.1 million individuals without insurance. This rate is not significantly different from the Q4 2023 uninsured rate of 7.7 percent. The estimates imply that in early 2024 as in 2023, over 300 million Americans have health insurance coverage. August 2024 DATA POINT 2 METHODS The NHIS, which is administered by the National Center for Health Statistics, is the largest nationally representative survey focused primarily on the health of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. As such, it is a key data source for tracking trends in health coverage. Quarterly estimates are from the NHIS Early Release program, which provides national estimates for broad categories of health coverage: public, private, and uninsured.2 For these coverage measures, estimates are reported for subpopulations defined by age, race/ethnicity and family income. In addition, the Early Release program provides quarterly estimates of the percentage of adults ages 18 to 64 with private, exchange-based (i.e., Marketplace) health plan coverage. The sample sizes for the quarterly data are relatively small: roughly 8,000 observations per quarter for adults and roughly 2,000 observations per quarter for children. As a result, quarterly estimates have wider confidence intervals than annual estimates. All estimates are unadjusted percentages based on preliminary data files and are released prior to final data editing and final weighting. FINDINGS To provide historical context, we begin by presenting long run trends in health coverage. Figure 1 presents the uninsured rate for the total U.S. population since 2000. Each data point from 2000 to 2023 represents an annual estimate from the NHIS. The last data point represents the quarterly estimate for Q1 2024. In 2000, just under 15 percent of the population was uninsured and by 2010, the year that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted, the uninsured rate had increased to 16 percent. The uninsured rate began to fall after the ACA\u2019s coverage provision went into effect. The first provision, which went into effect in September 2010, allows young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26. Two other ACA coverage provisions\u2014the expansion of Medicaid eligibility and private insurance reforms, including tax credits for the purchase of private coverage through the newly established Marketplaces\u2014went into effect in January 2014. By 2015, the uninsured rate had declined to 9.1 percent. The uninsured rate stayed at that level through 2017 before increasing slightly the next two years. In 2019, 10.3 percent of the total U.S. population, or 33.2 million people, was uninsured.a Three pieces of legislation aimed to stabilize health coverage in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) provided states additional federal financial support if they met certain conditions, including agreeing to maintain the enrollment of most Medicaid beneficiaries. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) increased Marketplace premium tax credits for individuals and families with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the FPL and extended eligibility for premium tax credits to those with income above 400 percent of the FPL. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) renewed these Marketplace tax credit enhancements through 2025. In addition to these legislative efforts, the Biden-Harris Administration took administrative actions to improve access to health coverage, including creating special enrollment periods for Marketplace coverage and increasing funding for education and outreach.3 At the state level, since 2020 seven states (UT, ID, NE, OK, MO, SD, and NC) have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion. The uninsured rate fell after these policies went into effect. The annual rates were 9.7 percent in 2020, 9.2 percent in 2021, 8.4 percent in 2022, and 7.6 percent in 2023. The uninsured rate for Q1 2024 is 8.2 percent, _______________________ a The NHIS underwent a survey redesign in 2019. Though the questions on health coverage did not change, the questionnaire design and sample weighting were revised. An analysis conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics concluded that the redesign may have caused the uninsured rate for adults to increase by 0.7 percentage points. For further details, see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/EReval202009-508.pdf. August 2024 DATA POINT 3 which corresponds to 27.1 million people. The estimated uninsured rate for Q1 2024 is not significantly different from the full-year estimate for 2023 or the quarterly estimate for Q4 2023 (7.7 percent).4 Figure 1.

The FFCRA\u2019s additional federal financial support for maintaining enrollment of most Medicaid beneficiaries went into effect retroactively on January 1, 2020 and the Consolidated Appropriation Act (CAA) of 2023 phased out the increase over three quarters, starting on March 31, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2023. The ARP premium tax credit provisions were effective for PY2021 and PY2022, and the IRA extended these provisions for PY2023 through PY2025. Beginning in 2004, two additional questions were added to the NHIS insurance section to reduce potential errors in reporting Medicare and Medicaid status, resulting in two methods to estimate uninsurance. Beginning in 2005, all estimates were calculated using Method 2. Please see \u201cTechnical Notes\u201d for the Early Release of Health Insurance Estimates Based on Data From the 2010 National Health Interview Survey for more information. To focus on recent trends, Figure 2 presents quarterly data on health coverage from Q1 2020 to Q1 2024. Data are reported separately for non-elderly adults (ages 18 to 64) and children (ages 0 to 17). The graph for adults indicates a gradual decline in the uninsured rate from Q4 2020 to Q2 2023, followed by a slight increase since then. The Q1 2024 uninsured rate for non-elderly adults is 0.5 percentage points higher than the rate for Q4 2023 and 3 percentage points lower than the rate from Q4 2020. For children, there is less evidence of a trend over the full period. The most recent quarterly data indicate that 5.2 percent of children are uninsured, up from 4.3 percent in Q4 2023. For both adults and children, the change between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 is not statistically significant.

For adults, there appears to be a clear downward trend since Q2 2023, when states began to return to regular Medicaid renewal operations following the end of the Medicaid continuous enrollment condition on March 31, 2023. Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the percentage of non-elderly adults with private coverage declined by over 3 percentage points, from 24.8 percent to 21.4 percent. This difference is statistically significant. Even with this recent decrease, the Q1 2024 public coverage rate for adults remains above the rate as of Q1 2020 (20.3 percent). The percentage of children with public coverage was stable throughout 2023 before decreasing from 44.6 percent in Q4 2023 to 42.4 percent in Q1 2024. There is substantial overlap in the 95 percent confidence intervals of these two estimates, indicating that this change is not statistically significant at the 5 percent confidence level. 13.9% 11.5% 4.8% 5.2% 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 18-64 years 0-17 years August 2024 DATA POINT 5 Figure 3.

Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the percentage of non-elderly adults with private coverage increased by 1.5 percentage points, from 67.1 percent to 68.6 percent. Comparing this to the results from Figure 3 implies that 44 percent of the decline in public insurance observed over this period was offset by an increase in private coverage (1.5/3.4 = 0.44). The increase in private coverage was driven by an increase in exchange-based private coverage (Figure 5). Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the percentage of 18 to 64-year-olds with exchange-based coverage increased by 2.2 percentage points. Based on an estimated 200 million adults in this age range, this translates to an increase of over 4 million people. Similar to adults, for children public coverage decreased and private coverage increased between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024. The magnitude of the private coverage increase was slightly more than one-quarter the absolute magnitude of the public coverage decrease (0.7/2.7 = 0.26). In Q1 2024, 42.4 percent of children had public coverage and 54.2 percent had private coverage. For all individuals under age 65, private coverage increased by 1.3 percentage points between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024 (data not shown). 20.3% 22.0% 21.4% 40.9% 45.6% 42.4% 0.0% 5.0% 10.0% 15.0% 20.0% 25.0% 30.0% 35.0% 40.0% 45.0% 50.0% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 18-64 years 0-17 years August 2024 DATA POINT 6 Figure 4.

Since Q2 2023, the uninsured rate for the lower two income groups appears to be trending up (Figure 6), corresponding to a similar decrease in public coverage (Figure 7). The percentage of adults with private coverage increased between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024 for the lowest income group, but not for 100-199 FPL category (Figure 8). The Q1 2024 uninsured rate for the higher two income categories was essentially the same as in Q2 2023. 67.9% 66.1% 68.6% 56.2% 52.0% 54.2% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 18-64 years 0-17 years 4.5% 5.1% 5.0% 7.2% 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 August 2024 DATA POINT 7 Figure 6.

These estimates are presented in Appendix Tables A1-A3. Throughout the time period reported in these figures, Hispanic adults were most likely to be uninsured than Blacks, who were more likely to be uninsured than Whites and Asians. Because of small samples, these estimates are noisy, making it difficult to assess short-run trends. Other ASPE research that tracks coverage over a longer period finds that these coverage disparities are significantly smaller than they were prior to the ACA coverage expansions.5,6,7 DISCUSSION On March 31, 2023, the continuous enrollment condition established by the FFCRA ended. In the following months, states began to resume regular Medicaid renewal and redetermination operations, a process commonly referred to as Medicaid \u201cunwinding.\u201d States varied in when they began this process; most began some time in Q2 2023, and all had begun by the end of 2023. Between March 2023 and April 2024, Medicaid enrollment had decreased by 12 million.8 The NHIS data presented in this Data Point cover a full year of the unwinding process. It is difficult to compare the NHIS estimates to the administrative enrollment data, for several reasons. One is the well-known finding that Medicaid enrollment is undercounted in national surveys and this undercount has grown in recent years.9,10,11,12 In addition, there are complications related to timing. Some people may not realize that they no longer have Medicaid until they go to use care, which may be some time after they were formally disenrolled. The results reported here are consistent with such a lag. For example, the percent of NHIS respondents reporting that they had public coverage actually increased between Q1 and Q2 2023, even as administrative data was showing a decrease in enrollment. Additionally, between Q2 and Q4 2023, the administrative data indicate that Medicaid/CHIP enrollment for children fell by nearly 3 million, yet in the NHIS public coverage for children was essentially unchanged. The most recent NHIS data reported in this Data Point indicate a larger decline in public coverage for children from Q3 2023 to Q1 2024, albeit one that is not statistically significant 23.4% 21.1% 27.8% 38.8% 39.2% 40.8% 71.4% 67.1% 70.5% 89.8% 90.9% 90.9% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2022 2023 2024 <100% FPL 100-199% FPL 200-400% FPL >400% FPL August 2024 DATA POINT 9 due to the small quarterly samples. Over this most recent period, the decline in Medicaid/CHIP enrollment has slowed considerably. In fact, child enrollment was marginally higher in March 2024 than in December 2023.13 Abstracting from these issues of timing, comparing the decline in Medicaid enrollment to the much smaller increase in the estimated number of uninsured in the NHIS suggest that the majority of people who left Medicaid during the first year of the unwinding period have transitioned to other sources of coverage. This finding is consistent with analyses conducted prior to the end of the continuous enrollment condition, which projected that when the unwinding process was complete, between 60 and 80 percent of individuals leaving Medicaid would gain some other source of coverage. 14,15,16,17 This research also projects that the majority of individuals becoming uninsured to be eligible for either employer-sponsored insurance, subsidized Marketplace coverage, or Medicaid/CHIP. To facilitate smooth transitions between Medicaid and private insurance coverage, the Biden-Harris Administration established a Marketplace Special Enrollment Period (SEP) on HealthCare.gov for qualified individuals and their families losing Medicaid or CHIP coverage due to the end of the Medicaid continuous enrollment condition. State-based Marketplaces adopted similar SEP flexibilities. The Administration also continued to invest heavily in Marketplace outreach and consumer education, providing $99 million in grants to Marketplace Navigators in 2023.1 These efforts contributed to record Marketplace enrollment of over 21 million people.18 The increase in Marketplace enrollment is evident in the most recent NHIS data. Efforts taken to streamline Medicaid renewals during the unwinding period, such as using data from other programs to verify financial eligibility and renew people automatically\u2014a process referred to as ex parte renewals\u2014have helped eligible people remain enrolled and have limited coverage losses. Between April 2023 and March 2024, ex parte renewal rates increased by 80 percent, while the percentage of individuals disenrolled for procedural reasons fell roughly in half.19 Continuing such approaches should contribute to greater coverage stability in the longer term. In addition, as a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, most children newly enrolling or renewing their Medicaid or CHIP coverage after January 1, 2024, are guaranteed 12 months of continuous eligibility. A recent ASPE report estimated that more than 17 million Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children will potentially benefit from this policy.20 CONCLUSION This Data Point presents trends in health coverage through Q1 2024 based on data from the NHIS Early Release Program. Previous reports documented that the percentage of Americans without health insurance decreased by roughly 2 percentage points between 2020 and 2023.21 The most recent data indicate that between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, the uninsured rate increased by a statistically insignificant 0.5 percentage points to 8.2 percent. This estimate implies that 27.1 million people lacked health coverage in Q1 2024. The data reported here reflect changes in coverage during the first four quarters of states of states returning to regular Medicaid redetermination and renewal operations. It remains to be seen if the effects of this process and recent coverage policies have been fully captured in the NHIS data. ASPE will continue to monitor quarterly NHIS data to assess ongoing changes in coverage. August 2024 DATA POINT 10 APPENDIX Appendix Figure A1.

      "Signal Timing\n\u00a0\nWhy Correct Signal Timing is so Important\n(Read the Full Report)\nAt signalized intersections, the period between conflicting green phases is known as the change interval.\u00a0 It is composed of a yellow signal phase plus an optional all-red interval.\u00a0 The purpose of the yellow phase is to alert drivers that their right-of-way is about to end and, depending upon their relative proximity to the intersection, to permit them to come to a safe stop or allow them time to clear the limit line prior to the onset of the red phase. The purpose of the all-red interval is to allow vehicles which have lega1ly entered the intersection prior to the onset of the red signal to clear any potential points of conflict before the release of opposing vehicles or pedestrians.\nTransportation officials and engineers know that the proper timing of the change interval is essential to intersection safety.\u00a0 If the yellow signal phase is too short, a \u201cdilemma zone\u201d is created.\u00a0 Motorists who are unfortunate enough to be within this section of the roadway when the yellow signal illuminates may neither be able to stop safely nor legally enter the intersection before the onset of the red phase.\u00a0 Dilemma zones virtually assure that some percentage of drivers will be forced to brake suddenly or violate the red, thereby creating the potential for rear end collisions or vehicle conflicts within the intersection.\u00a0 If the all-red interval is insufficient, vehicles from the previous green phase may not have completely cleared the intersection prior to the release of cross traffic.\u00a0 Again, this generates the potential for vehicle conflicts including highly dangerous broadside collisions within the intersection.\nWhen both the yellow and all-red phases are too short, a significant safety hazard is created.\u00a0 Some drivers will be forced to violate the red due to the too-short yellow and cross traffic will be released before they completely clear the intersection. Intersections which exhibit a higher than average number of red-light related collisions most likely have either a yellow phase or all-red phase which is too short.\u00a0 Often times, both problems exist at the same intersection.\u00a0 Correcting the signal timing will most likely eliminate the vast majority of collisions at these locations.\nHow the Yellow Phase is Determined\nA mathematical formula established by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) is used to calculate the minimum safe time for the yellow signal and is primarily based on the speed of the traffic approaching the intersection and the reaction time of the average driver.\nThe ITE specifies the 85th percentile speed of free flow traffic be used as the approach speed to ensure that the yellow phase provides sufficient stopping time for at least 85% of the vehicles approaching the intersection.\u00a0 California law requires the use of the 85th percentile speed or the posted speed limit.\u00a0 However, if the posted speed limit is used and the 85th percentile speed is substantially greater, then the yellow phase will be under-timed and a safety hazard will exist as a significant number of drivers will encounter a dilemma zone.\u00a0 For example, if the yellow signal is timed for 35 mph, the yellow light will be set at 3.6 seconds, but if the 85th percentile speed of traffic is 45 mph the yellow signal should be 4.3 seconds, too short by almost 1 full second.\u00a0 While this difference may not seem like much, it will often make the difference between whether or not a violation occurs.\nDriver perception-reaction time, is the time between the onset of the yellow phase and when the vehicle\u2019s brakes engage.\u00a0 During this time, the driver must see the light change from green to yellow, perceive the meaning of the change, decide whether they are able to safely stop or if they should continue through the intersection, and if they decide to stop, move their foot off the accelerator and apply the brakes. The ITE suggests that a value of 1 second be used for this variable.\u00a0 However, a number of studies suggest that this figure may not adequately account for driver perception-reaction times, especially in an urban environment such as Los Angeles due to \u201ccognitive overload\u201d where the reaction time may actually be closer to 1.5 seconds.\nMaximizing Safety through Longer Yellow Timing\nSafety dictates that the yellow signal time be calculated using the 85th percentile speed of free flow traffic approaching the intersection based on a current traffic survey.\u00a0 When a survey is unavailable, the 85th percentile speed should be assumed to be at least 10 mph above the posted speed limit.\u00a0 Likewise, in the interest of safety, driver reaction time should be assumed to be at least 1.4 seconds.\u00a0 Together, this change would likely increase the yellow time at many intersections by about 1 second and significantly improve safety.\nThe safety benefit of longer yellow signal times has been proven in a number of studies.\u00a0 A Texas DOT study found that when the yellow interval is set one second longer than the minimum time, violations decreased by 53% and crashes decreased by 40%.\nThe chart below shows a similar 30% to 55% reduction in violations achieved at San Diego red-light camera sites when the yellow interval times were increased.\n\nLikewise, the following two figures show how Fairfax County, VA achieved a significant, sustained reduction in violations when the yellow timing was increased\nby \u00bd second.\u00a0 Note also that red-light cameras were present during the entire review period, but a dramatic reduction in violations was seen only after the yellow timing was increased.\n\n\nAs for concerns that drivers will modify their behavior to account for the longer yellow light and still run the red, the data shows that such an adjustment does not happen provided the yellow time does not exceed about 5.5 seconds.\nHow the All-Red Clearance Phase is Determined\nThe ITE uses another formula to calculate the appropriate all-red phase which takes into consideration the width of the intersection and the speed of traffic. In contrast to the formula for the yellow signal timing this formula uses the speed of the slowest 15% of drivers to ensure that these vehicles have sufficient time to clear the intersection prior to the release of cross traffic.\u00a0 Generally the 15th percentile speed can be assumed to be 5 \u2013 10 mph below the posted speed limit.\nMaximizing Safety through a Longer All-Red Phase\nAs discussed previously, the purpose of the all-red phase is to allow vehicles that enter the intersection in the last moments of the yellow phase to clear the intersection prior to release of cross traffic or pedestrians.\u00a0 Wider intersections necessarily require longer all-red phases.\u00a0 A vehicle traveling at 35 mph will require just over 2 seconds to clear an intersection 90 feet wide and 2.83 seconds to completely clear an intersection 125 feet wide.\u00a0 Slower vehicles would require more time to clear those intersections.\u00a0 These clearance intervals provide a sufficient all-red phase to clear any vehicles that cross the limit line just as the signal changes from yellow to red.\u00a0 However, in real world situations, some drivers will enter the intersection just after the signal turns to red.\u00a0 This is often due to yellow times that are too short, drivers who simply miscalculate the time it will take them to reach the limit line before the yellow phase ends, or drivers who hesitate or slow momentarily before deciding they have sufficient time to make it into the intersection before the red illuminates.\u00a0\u00a0 The 2004 Texas DOT study determined that when a red light violation occurs, about 60 percent of the time it occurs within the first half second of the red phase.\u00a0 The distribution of red light violations as a function of time-into-red appears in the figure below.\n\nIn order to minimize the chance that collisions will occur at signalized intersections, the all-red clearance interval must be long enough to allow all vehicles to clear the intersection before cross traffic is released.\u00a0 This interval should be extended slightly to account for vehicles that enter the intersection just after the red phase begins.\u00a0 For example, a vehicle traveling at 35 mph would require approximately 2 seconds to clear an 80 foot wide intersection.\u00a0 However, if the driver miscalculates or hesitates and enters the intersection \u00bd second after the light turns red, his vehicle will not completely clear the intersection until 2.5 seconds after the red phase begins.\u00a0 In this situation, the 2 second all-red clearance interval dictated by the ITE formula would not be sufficient to prevent a possible vehicle conflict within the intersection.\u00a0 While it may not be desirable to increase the all-red phase to account for every vehicle that might enter the intersection after the red phase begins, extending the all-red phase \u00bd second beyond the time calculated using the ITE formula would prevent collisions that might be caused by the 60% of violations that occur immediately after the onset of red.\u00a0 This could add an additional measure of safety without unduly reducing traffic flow.\nExisting Conditions at Los Angeles Intersections\nAs part of an ongoing study of traffic safety in Los Angeles, Safer Streets L.A. identified intersections within the city with a higher than average number of red-light related collisions.\u00a0 Without exception, we found that either the yellow time, the all-red phase or both are currently below the ITE minimums based on the actual speed of traffic at these locations and therefore insufficient to provide the margin of safety necessary to protect the motoring public.\u00a0 In some cases the yellow signal time is 1 full second too short and the all-red phase is a much as 2 seconds too short.\nUnquestionably, at intersections where red-light related accidents are over represented, an engineering deficiency exists.\u00a0 As explained above, drivers in an urban environment such as L.A. may need additional reaction time to respond to the yellow signal and routinely travel at 10 mph or more beyond the posted speed limit.\u00a0 Therefore, it would be prudent to extend the yellow signal time at least 1 second and extend the all-red clearance interval at least 0.5 seconds beyond the ITE minimums.\u00a0 Additional engineering improvements may be necessary at some intersections to be determined based on a comprehensive engineering survey.\nThe City of Los Angeles now has an economical option available that would achieve a greater safety benefit than the proposed multi-million dollar red-light camera program.\u00a0 The cost to change signal timing is insignificant.\u00a0 The City can swiftly achieve a reduction in accidents as well as violations at numerous signalized intersections simply by extending the yellow and all-red signal phases.\u00a0 There is no reason not to immediately implement these strategies at problem intersections.\u00a0 Failure to do so not only puts the motoring public at risk, it leaves the City open to the possibility of litigation should injuries or fatalities occur due to deficient signal timing.\n(Read the Full Report)\nJoin the National Motorists Association to learn more and continue the fight for your driving rights.\n\nYour donation is tax deductible.\nRecent

      "MOTOR\nResults for {phrase}\n\nAutomotive Data since 1903\n\nDealer Service Satisfaction Improves but Appointment Wait Times Continue to Grow\nDealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments\nBy J.D. Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience.

      "MOTOR\nResults for {phrase}\n\nAutomotive Data since 1903\n\nDealer Service Satisfaction Improves but Appointment Wait Times Continue to Grow\nDealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments\nBy J.D. Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience. The study measures satisfaction with service at franchised dealer or aftermarket service facilities for maintenance or repair work among owners and lessees of one- to three-year-old vehicles.\nIt also provides a numerical index ranking of the highest-performing automotive brands sold in the United States, which is based on the combined scores of five measures that comprise the vehicle owner service experience. These measures are (in order of importance): service quality; service advisor; vehicle pick-up; service facility; and service initiation.

Travel times will be reduced by up to 20% during peak traffic periods. Adjustments were also made to the timing during other parts of the day to make signals more responsive to side-street traffic and pedestrians while still keeping Dodge Street moving smoothly.\nPedestrian safety benefits along the corridor include the implementation of 72 new leading pedestrian interval phases. A reprogrammed walk signal with leading pedestrian intervals displays a walk signal before a green light, allowing pedestrians a head start in crossing the street to establish a more visible presence in the intersection before vehicles are allowed to turn right or left. Cycle lengths at Dodge Street signals were lowered during 18 hours of a typical weekday, resulting in lower overall delays for pedestrians and drivers.\nThe Public Works Department has developed a series of traffic safety videos on topics such as the signal technology enhancements rolling out across Omaha, pedestrian and driver safety, and flashing yellow arrow signals.

Various traditional models (LR, DT, RF, GB, KNN, MLP, SVM) and H2O-SEM approach are compared based on Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination. Additionally, the H2O AutoML module is introduced as an alternative for comparison. The traffic generation and investigation are performed using the SUMO simulator. The findings aim to identify the most effective model for accurate waiting time prediction at intersections.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nComparative Analysis of Waiting Delay Estimation Models for Signalized Intersections: A Case Study Tumakuru City\n                                        \n\n\nA Hybrid Approach for Traffic Delay Estimation\n                                        \n\n\nA Study of Delay Estimation Methods at Signalized Intersections for Mixed Traffic Condition\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData Availability\nThe data and materials supporting the findings of this study are available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.\nAbbreviations\nArtificial Intelligence\nConvolutional Neural Network\nK- Nearest Neighbour\nRecurrent Neural Network\nDecision Tree\nRoot Mean Squared Log Error\nRandom Forest\nMachine Learning\nSupport Vector Machine\nGradient Boosting\nSimulation of Urban MObility\nLinear Regression\nDeep Learning\n SHapley Additive exPlanations\nMean Absolute Percentage Error\n Congestion Level\nLong Short-Term Model\nGeneralized Additive Model\nMean Residual Deviance\nPartial dependence plot\nMulti - Layer Perceptron\nGeneralized Linear Model\nDistributed Random Forest\nPrincipal Component Analysis\nStandard Deviation\nGeneralized Low Rank Model\nStacked Ensemble Model\neXtreme Gradient Boosting\nReferences\nRosero, F., Fonseca, N., L\u00f3pez, J., Casanova, J.: Effects of passenger load, road grade, and congestion level on real-world fuel consumption and emissions from compressed natural gas and diesel urban buses.

Various traditional models (LR, DT, RF, GB, KNN, MLP, SVM) and H2O-SEM approach are compared based on Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination. Additionally, the H2O AutoML module is introduced as an alternative for comparison. The traffic generation and investigation are performed using the SUMO simulator. The findings aim to identify the most effective model for accurate waiting time prediction at intersections.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nComparative Analysis of Waiting Delay Estimation Models for Signalized Intersections: A Case Study Tumakuru City\n                                        \n\n\nA Hybrid Approach for Traffic Delay Estimation\n                                        \n\n\nA Study of Delay Estimation Methods at Signalized Intersections for Mixed Traffic Condition\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData Availability\nThe data and materials supporting the findings of this study are available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.\nAbbreviations\nArtificial Intelligence\nConvolutional Neural Network\nK- Nearest Neighbour\nRecurrent Neural Network\nDecision Tree\nRoot Mean Squared Log Error\nRandom Forest\nMachine Learning\nSupport Vector Machine\nGradient Boosting\nSimulation of Urban MObility\nLinear Regression\nDeep Learning\n SHapley Additive exPlanations\nMean Absolute Percentage Error\n Congestion Level\nLong Short-Term Model\nGeneralized Additive Model\nMean Residual Deviance\nPartial dependence plot\nMulti - Layer Perceptron\nGeneralized Linear Model\nDistributed Random Forest\nPrincipal Component Analysis\nStandard Deviation\nGeneralized Low Rank Model\nStacked Ensemble Model\neXtreme Gradient Boosting\nReferences\nRosero, F., Fonseca, N., L\u00f3pez, J., Casanova, J.: Effects of passenger load, road grade, and congestion level on real-world fuel consumption and emissions from compressed natural gas and diesel urban buses.

      "\nIn this article\nABC Analysis is a method used in supply chain management to categorize inventory into three groups\u00e2\u0080\u0094A, B, and C\u00e2\u0080\u0094based on their importance. This classification helps businesses prioritize their resources and focus on the most critical items.\nAn Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN), sometimes referred to as Advance Ship Notice, is a notification sent by a supplier or manufacturer to a customer or retailer to provide detailed information about a pending shipment. The ASN serves as an electronic document that outlines the contents of the shipment before it physically arrives at the destination. \nAn agile supply chain is a flexible and responsive approach to supply chain management that enables organizations to quickly adapt to changing market conditions, customer demands, and disruptions. It focuses on enhancing speed, efficiency, and adaptability throughout the entire supply chain process, from sourcing raw materials to delivering finished products to customers.\nAn air waybill (AWB) is a vital logistics document used in air freight transportation. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper (consignor) and the airline (carrier), detailing the terms and conditions of air transportation for the shipment. The air waybill contains essential information such as the origin and destination of the cargo, the description of goods, the weight, and the freight charges.\nAn arrival notice is a notification sent by a carrier or freight forwarder to inform consignees or recipients that a shipment has arrived at its destination port or facility. This notice serves as an important communication tool in the supply chain, providing recipients with essential information about the arrival of their goods and detailing the next steps for delivery or pickup.\nAn Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a tracking system used in the maritime industry to monitor the location and movement of ships. AIS provides real-time information about vessel identification, position, course, and speed. \n\u00e2\u0080\u008dBackhauling is a transportation logistics practice where trucks carry a return load on their way back from delivering goods to their destination. Instead of returning empty, trucks utilize their empty space to transport goods from the destination back to the point of origin or another destination along the route. \nIn supply chain management, \"backorder\" refers to a situation where a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily unavailable in the seller's inventory. When an item is on backorder, it means the customer's order cannot be fulfilled immediately due to insufficient stock levels.\n\nA bay plan is a diagram that details the stowage of containers on a vessel, specifying their exact position by bay, row, and tier to ensure efficient and safe loading and unloading operations.\nA Beneficial Cargo Owner (BCO) is the entity with ownership or a beneficial interest in transported goods. While not always the shipper, the BCO reaps the benefits of the cargo's arrival. \nA bill of lading (B/L) is a legal document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract between the shipper (seller) and the carrier (transport provider), detailing the terms and conditions of transportation, including the type, quantity, and destination of the goods.\nBlank sailing is a term used to describe the situation when a shipping line cancels a scheduled port call or an entire voyage. This can happen for various reasons, such as low demand for shipping services, operational issues, or unforeseen circumstances like bad weather or port congestion.\nA blind shipment refers to a logistics practice where certain details about the shipment, such as the sender, receiver, or contents, are intentionally obscured or withheld from one or both parties involved in the transaction. This is typically done to maintain confidentiality or to prevent competitors from obtaining sensitive information about suppliers, customers, or pricing.\nA bonded warehouse is a secured facility authorized by customs authorities where imported goods can be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations without payment of duty.\nA booking confirmation is a document that verifies the reservation of space for cargo on a carrier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vessel, flight, or truck, ensuring all shipping arrangements are approved and scheduled.\nA request for reservation of space and equipment for a particular vessel/voyage and possibly inland transport.\nBreak bulk cargo refers to goods that are individually packaged or bundled, rather than being transported in containers or in bulk. These items are often large or irregular in size and include products like machinery, vehicles, construction materials, or heavy equipment. \nBuffer stock, also known as inventory buffer or stock buffer, refers to the extra inventory held by a company to mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by uncertainties in supply and demand. It acts as a cushion against fluctuations in customer demand, supply chain disruptions, and variations in lead times.\nBulk cargo refers to commodities that are transported unpackaged in large quantities, typically stored and handled in bulk form, rather than in individual units or containers. This category of cargo is crucial in global trade, especially for goods that are homogeneous and not easily damaged during transportation.\nThe bullwhip effect, also known as demand amplification or whiplash effect, is a phenomenon that occurs in supply chains where small fluctuations in demand at the consumer level lead to exaggerated fluctuations in demand further upstream in the supply chain. This amplification of demand variability causes inefficiencies, such as excess inventory, stockouts, and increased costs, as supply chain partners overreact to perceived demand changes.\nCIF, or Cost, Insurance, and Freight, is an international shipping agreement used in the transportation of goods. In freight shipping, CIF means that the seller takes responsibility for the cost of transporting goods to the buyer's destination port. This includes paying for shipping, handling, and insurance. The seller's obligations end when the goods reach the destination port, at which point the buyer assumes responsibility for customs clearance, import duties, and any further transport to their final destination.\nA Capesize ship is a large bulk carrier vessel designed to transport heavy raw materials across long distances, too large to transit through canals like the Panama or Suez.\nThe action of allowing cargo to leave the container yard typically authorized by the carrier. This is often confused with gate-out, but cargo release is the authorization necessary before shipments can be allowed to gate-out.\nA cargo survey is an inspection process that assesses the condition and quantity of goods during transportation to ensure compliance with shipping terms and prevent disputes.\nA shipping carrier is an organization that provides transportation services for goods. They manage the logistics of moving cargo, which includes loading, transporting, and delivering goods to the specified location. Shipping carriers handle various types of shipments, from small packages to large freight consignments, using different modes of transportation such as maritime, air, rail, and road.\nCarrier haulage refers to a transportation arrangement where the carrier, typically the ocean shipping line or its designated transport provider, is responsible for arranging and paying for the inland transportation of containers. In this scenario, the carrier takes charge of moving the container from the port of discharge to the final destination or vice versa, using their own transportation assets or subcontracted carriers.\nA carrier scorecard is a performance measurement tool used by supply chain and logistics professionals to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of their freight carriers. It provides a standardized way to assess carriers based on various performance metrics, helping organizations make informed decisions about their logistics partners\nA certificate of origin is a document issued by an authorized body or organization that certifies the country in which the goods being shipped were manufactured, produced, or processed. It serves as a declaration by the exporter to the customs authorities of the importing country, providing information about the origin of the goods and facilitating trade by ensuring compliance with trade agreements, tariffs, and regulations.\nA commercial invoice is a crucial document used in international trade transactions to provide details of the goods being shipped and their corresponding value. It serves as a formal request for payment from the buyer to the seller and is essential for customs clearance and regulatory compliance.\nIn shipping, a commodity refers to bulk goods or raw materials that are transported in large volumes as part of global trade.\nIn the realm of supply chain and logistics, the term \"Consignee\" refers to the individual, company, or entity to whom a shipment of goods is delivered. The consignee is the designated recipient or receiver of the goods, typically identified by name and address on shipping documents such as the bill of lading or delivery order.\nConsignment inventory is a supply chain arrangement where a supplier (consignor) retains ownership of goods while they are held at a customer's (consignee's) location. The consignee only pays for the goods when they are sold or consumed, and the supplier retains responsibility for managing and replenishing the inventory as needed.\nIn shipping and logistics, a consignor refers to the entity or person who is the sender or shipper of goods. The consignor is responsible for initiating the shipment of goods from one location to another, typically to a consignee or recipient.\nA container depot is a facility used for the storage, maintenance, and repair of empty shipping containers when they are not actively in use for transportation.\nContainer discharge is the process of unloading shipping containers from a vessel at a port, using cranes and other equipment, for onward transportation.\nA container freight station (CFS) is a designated facility where goods are received, sorted, and prepared for onward transportation, enhancing efficiency in logistics operations.\nShipping container grades classify containers based on their condition and suitability for transporting goods, ranging from cargo-worthy to as-is quality.\nA container packing certificate is a document that verifies the proper packing and loading of goods into a shipping container. It attests that the contents have been securely packed, arranged, and secured according to industry standards and regulatory requirements. Obtaining a container packing certificate is crucial for compliance with international shipping regulations and contractual obligations. It provides assurance that the goods have been properly prepared for transport, minimizing the risk of delays, damages, or disputes during the shipment process.\nA container rollover occurs when a shipping container is not loaded onto its scheduled vessel and is instead 'rolled over' to a subsequent vessel. This delay means the container misses its intended departure and must wait for the next available sailing, which can significantly impact lead times and delivery schedules.\nContainer stripping (devanning) is the process of unloading cargo from a shipping container at its destination for inspection, storage, or further distribution.\nContainer stuffing is the process of loading cargo into a shipping container in a safe and space-efficient manner for transportation.\nCross docking is a logistics strategy where incoming goods from suppliers are unloaded from incoming trucks or containers and directly loaded onto outbound trucks or trailers, with minimal or no storage time in between. Essentially, it involves transferring goods directly from the inbound dock to the outbound dock, bypassing the need for traditional warehousing storage.\nA customs broker is a licensed professional who specializes in facilitating the clearance of goods through customs barriers for importers and exporters. Acting as intermediaries between businesses and customs authorities, customs brokers ensure compliance with regulations and smooth passage of goods across international borders.\nCustoms clearance refers to the process of fulfilling the legal requirements necessary to facilitate the import or export of goods across international borders. This procedure ensures that shipments comply with local laws and regulations, allowing them to enter or leave a country legally. It involves various documentation, inspections, and payments of duties and taxes.\nA customs manifest lists in detail all the bills of lading issued by a carrier, its agent or master for a specific voyage and port call. It is a detailed summary of the total cargo of a vessel and is used principally for customs purposes. It acts as a declaration to customs authorities, ensuring compliance with regulations and facilitating smooth movement of goods through ports and checkpoints.\nThe latest point in time where a container has to be delivered to a terminal to be loaded on a vessel, or where certain documentation has to be provided by the Shipper.Example: CY cut-off, FCL cut-off, VGM cut-off, DG cut-off.\nCycle counting is a methodical approach to inventory management where a subset of inventory is counted on a continuous basis, typically throughout the year. Unlike traditional annual or periodic inventory counts that halt operations, cycle counting allows businesses to maintain regular operations while ensuring accurate stock levels.\nDAP, or Delivered At Place, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller's obligation to deliver goods to a designated location in the buyer's country. In DAP terms, the seller is responsible for all costs and risks associated with delivering the goods to the agreed-upon destination. This includes arranging transportation, handling charges, and insurance up to the point of delivery. The buyer, however, is responsible for unloading the goods, handling customs clearance, and paying any import duties and taxes once the goods arrive at the destination.\nDDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping terms dictate that the seller assumes all responsibilities and costs associated with delivering the goods to the buyer's specified destination. This includes transportation, insurance, handling charges, and import duties and taxes. Essentially, the seller handles everything from the point of origin to the final delivery location, ensuring the goods arrive ready for use by the buyer without any additional costs or logistical burdens.\nDDU, or Delivered Duty Unpaid, is an international shipping term that defines the responsibilities of the seller and buyer. Under DDU terms, the seller delivers the goods to a specified destination in the buyer's country, covering all costs and risks associated with transportation, except for duties, taxes, and other import charges which are the responsibility of the buyer. The seller's obligations include arranging and paying for freight, insurance, and handling charges until the goods reach the agreed-upon place.\nDPU, or Delivered at Place Unloaded, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller's responsibility to deliver and unload goods at a designated location in the buyer's country. Under DPU terms, the seller bears all costs and risks associated with transporting and unloading the goods at the agreed destination. This includes all transportation costs, including freight, insurance, and handling charges, up to and including the unloading of the goods at the destination. The buyer then takes over responsibility for import duties, taxes, customs clearance, and any further transport to the final destination. \nA dangerous goods declaration (DGD) is a legal document required for the transportation of hazardous materials or dangerous goods by air, sea, road, or rail. It provides detailed information about the nature, classification, packaging, and handling requirements of the dangerous goods being transported. The DGD helps ensure compliance with international regulations and facilitates the safe handling and transport of hazardous materials throughout the supply chain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008dDeadheading is the practice of operating a commercial vehicle, such as a truck or a trailer, without any cargo or paying passengers. Essentially, it refers to the movement of a vehicle while it is empty, either on its way to pick up a load or after delivering a load to its destination.\nDeadweight tonnage (DWT) is a measure of a ship's carrying capacity, representing the total weight of cargo, fuel, crew, provisions, and other materials that the vessel can safely carry. \nDemurrage refers to the additional charges imposed on the owner or operator of a vessel, freight car, or truck for delaying the use of equipment or facilities beyond the agreed-upon time. In the context of maritime shipping, demurrage applies to the time that cargo remains at the port or terminal beyond the allotted free time for loading or unloading.\nDetention charges are fees incurred when a carrier's equipment, such as containers or trailers, is held beyond the agreed-upon free time at a facility, such as a port, terminal, or warehouse. These charges compensate the carrier for the additional time their equipment is detained and unavailable for other use.\nA supply chain digital twin replicates the entire supply chain network, including assets, facilities, products, and processes, in a digital environment. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation of supply chain operations to improve efficiency, optimize decision-making, and mitigate risks.\nDimensional weight, also known as volumetric weight, is a pricing technique used by shipping carriers to calculate the cost of shipping packages based on their volume rather than just their actual weight. This method helps carriers account for the space that a package occupies in relation to its weight, ensuring fair pricing for shipping services.\nA dock receipt is a logistics document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge the receipt of goods at a shipping dock or terminal for transportation. It serves as a temporary receipt until the goods are loaded onto a vessel or other mode of transportation for shipment to their destination. The dock receipt contains essential information about the cargo, such as the quantity, description, condition, and destination, along with details about the carrier, shipper, and consignee.\nA ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s draft (draught) measures the depth of the vessel below the waterline, which determines the minimum water depth required for safe navigation.\n\nDrayage refers to the transportation of goods over a short distance, typically within the same metropolitan area or between nearby facilities. It plays a crucial role in the logistics and supply chain industry, linking various points in the transportation network, such as ports, rail terminals, and distribution centers. Drayage often involves moving goods from a transportation hub like a port to a nearby warehouse or vice versa.\nDrop shipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product using the drop shipping model, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer.\nDry bulk cargo refers to unpackaged, loose commodities that are shipped in large quantities and typically consist of raw materials. These goods are usually loaded directly into the holds of a vessel without any packaging, making them different from containerized or break bulk cargo. \nA booking received via Electronic Data Interchange, a standard electronic format for exchanging business documents within the supply chain, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipping notices, and other transactional information.\nAn Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number is a unique identifier assigned to businesses engaged in international trade within the European Union (EU) and certain other countries. It serves as a means of tracking and identifying entities involved in import, export, and other customs-related activities.\nIn shipping, ETA refers to the anticipated arrival time of a vessel, truck, or aircraft at a specified port or delivery location. It is calculated based on various factors such as the departure time, transit duration, and any potential delays due to weather, customs, or other unforeseen circumstances. This prediction helps logistics professionals plan and coordinate the movement of goods, ensuring timely deliveries and efficient supply chain management.\nEXW, or Ex Works, is one of the Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). It defines the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international transactions. Under EXW terms, the seller fulfills their obligation by making the goods available for pickup at their premises (factory, warehouse, etc.). The buyer assumes all risks and costs associated with transporting the goods from the seller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location to the final destination.\nEconomic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a fundamental concept in inventory management that determines the optimal quantity of goods a company should order to minimize total inventory costs. It balances the costs of holding inventory (holding costs) and the costs of ordering inventory (ordering costs) to find the most cost-effective quantity to order at any given time.\nAn Electronic Product Code (EPC) is a unique identifier used to distinguish individual items, cases, or pallets in the supply chain. It serves as a digital identifier that provides a standardized way to track and manage products throughout their lifecycle, from manufacturing to distribution to retail.\nUsed for storing cargo in/on during transport. The equipment \"size/type\" is defined by the ISO 6346 code. The most common equipment size/type is 20'/40'/45' Dry Freight Container, but a number of different versions exist.\nConfirmation & receipt of the equipment loaded/discharged on a vessel during a port call. This information is recorded by the terminal operator and sent to the carrier. This is often done using the EDI message - COARRI. The COARRI message reports that the equipment specified have been discharged from a seagoing vessel (discharged as ordered, over landed or short landed), or have been loaded into a seagoing vessel.\nA shipping exception is an unexpected event or disruption that causes a shipment to deviate from its planned delivery schedule.\nExpedited freight refers to a specialized service in logistics and supply chain management aimed at transporting goods quickly and efficiently to meet tight delivery deadlines. It is used when standard shipping methods cannot meet the required delivery timeframe, typically due to urgent customer needs, production delays, or unforeseen circumstances.\n\nFAS, or Free Alongside Ship, is a shipping term used in international trade that specifies the seller's responsibilities and costs up to the point where goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the designated port of shipment. The buyer then assumes all risks and costs from that point forward.\nFCA, or Free Carrier, is an Incoterm (International Commercial Term) used in international trade to define the point at which the seller's obligations are fulfilled and the buyer assumes responsibility for the goods. Under FCA, the seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier or another party nominated by the buyer at a specified place. \nFCL (Full Container Load) freight involves shipping an entire container for a single shipper, offering faster and more secure transport, especially for large-volume cargo.\nFOB, or Free on Board, is a term used in international trade to indicate when ownership and liability for goods transfer from the seller to the buyer. It specifies the point at which the seller is no longer responsible for the goods. This term is crucial for determining who pays for shipping, insurance, and other logistics costs, as well as who bears the risk during transit.\nAn entity operating a feeder service - ref. Feeder vessel.\nA container feeder vessel, also known as a feeder ship, is a relatively small cargo vessel that is specifically designed for transporting containers between smaller ports or terminals to larger hub ports where mainline vessels operate. These vessels serve as a crucial link in the global shipping network by facilitating the distribution of cargo to and from regional ports that may not be accessible to larger ships due to navigational constraints or limited infrastructure.\n\nA Feedermax container ship is a medium-sized vessel used to transport containers between regional ports and major ports, connecting smaller markets to global shipping routes.\nFill rate in supply chain management refers to the measurement of how fully customer demand for a product or service is met through the availability of inventory. It indicates the percentage of customer orders or demand that can be fulfilled immediately from stock, without backorders or delays.\nA \"Flag of Convenience\" (FOC) refers to the practice of a ship's owner registering a merchant vessel in a country other than the owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s country of origin to benefit from more favorable regulations, often related to taxes, labor laws, and safety standards. This practice allows shipowners to operate under less stringent regulations, often reducing operational costs and increasing profitability. However, FOC can also lead to concerns about safety, environmental standards, and working conditions for crew members, as the regulatory oversight in these flag states might not be as rigorous.\n4PL, or Fourth Party Logistics, refers to a logistics model where a single organization, known as the fourth-party logistics provider, takes on the responsibility of managing and coordinating the entire supply chain on behalf of the client. Unlike traditional third-party logistics (3PL) providers, who primarily handle specific logistics functions, 4PL providers offer comprehensive end-to-end supply chain management services. 4PL providers act as strategic partners, overseeing multiple 3PLs and other service providers to optimize supply chain operations, enhance efficiency, and achieve cost savings for their clients.\nA free trade zone (FTZ) is a designated area within a country where goods can be imported, stored, manufactured, or exported without being subject to the usual customs duties and tariffs. \nA freight forwarder is a vital link in the supply chain, specializing in the coordination and management of international shipments. Acting as an intermediary between shippers and carriers, freight forwarders handle various logistics tasks such as booking cargo space, arranging transportation, preparing documentation, and managing customs clearance.\nFreight visibility (also called shipment visibility) refers to the ability of supply chain professionals to track and monitor the movement of freight shipments throughout the supply chain. It involves gaining real-time insights into the location and status of goods as they move through various transportation modes and stages of the logistics process.\n\nFull truckload (FTL) freight refers to shipments that occupy the entire capacity of a truck trailer. Unlike less than truckload (LTL) shipments, FTL shipments do not share space with other cargo, allowing for direct transportation from the point of origin to the destination without intermediate stops.\nThe GLEC (Global Logistics Emissions Council) framework is a globally recognized standard developed to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from logistics activities. It provides guidelines and best practices for calculating emissions across various modes of transport, including road, rail, sea, and air. \nThe action of moving a container from a container yard, a terminal or another restricted/controlled area.\nThe German Supply Chain Act, also known as Lieferkettengesetz, is a landmark legislation enacted to promote corporate social responsibility and ensure ethical practices throughout global supply chains. Introduced in 2021, the law applies to German companies with over 3,000 employees, requiring them to monitor and address human rights abuses, environmental violations, and labor standards in their supply chains.\nA Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) is a unique identifier assigned to products in the supply chain to facilitate efficient tracking and management from production to point of sale. It provides a standardized method for identifying items globally, ensuring accurate inventory control, and enabling seamless transactions between trading partners.\n\nA Goods Receipt Note (GRN) is a document used in the process of confirming the receipt of goods from a supplier or vendor. It serves as an acknowledgment by the receiving party, typically a warehouse or a buyer, that the goods specified in the accompanying purchase order have been received in satisfactory condition. \nGreen logistics refers to the process of minimizing the environmental impact of logistics and supply chain activities, including transportation, warehousing, packaging, and distribution.\nA Handysize ship is a small to medium-sized bulk carrier designed for transporting various cargo types, capable of navigating smaller ports and shallow waters.\nGear used to do inland transportation of a container. This can include tools and apparatus used to load/discharge the container onto the intermodal type.\nSpecifications for a haulier set by a carrier in regards to a specific work order, e.g. timeline, capabilities.\nThe joint term for merchant and carrier haulage. It should be noted that a shipment can have several types of haulage throughout the transport from origin to destination.\nA haulier, also known as a trucking company or a carrier, is a business or individual that transports goods by road using trucks or lorries. Hauliers play a vital role in the transportation industry, moving goods between locations such as warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, ports, and retail stores. \nA House Bill of Lading (HBL) is a transportation document issued by a freight forwarder or Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier and includes details such as the type, quantity, and destination of the goods being transported. \nIn supply chain logistics, a hub and spoke model refers to a system where goods or services are transported through a central hub to various spoke locations. The hub acts as a central point for collection, sorting, and distribution, while the spokes represent the routes connecting the hub to different destinations.\nPort Congestion Holds Steady at Major Hubs as Mid-Sized Ports Struggle \nPort congestion is an inevitable consequence of typhoons and hurricanes, geopolitical disruption in the Red Sea and USEC labor action.\nFollowing similar events in Bangladesh in August, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports were forced to halt operations due to Typhoon Bebinca in September. But XL ports (those with an annual throughput greater than 10M TEU) have proven their resilience and ability to absorb much of the impact of such events. Despite the weather related disruptions, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports recorded lower average vessel anchor and container dwell times in September compared to August.\nMedium sized ports, however, are more likely to be feeling the effects of the endless series of supply chain crises. Average anchor times at ports with annual throughput between 500,000 and 4,000,000 TEU consistently see average vessel anchor times in excess of their larger counterparts. In September, seven of the ten most congested ports (by anchor time) fall into this category. These ports also see more volatility in congestion levels. Looking at the difference between the min and max monthly average anchor times over the past six months, medium sized ports occupy the top three spots: Charleston (3.5 days), Chittagong (3.0 days) and Durban (2.8 days).\u00c2\u00a0\nVessel Anchor Times: September 2024\nNo XL ports reported average anchor times of more than half a day. Among the world's largest ports, Shanghai and Jebel Ali reported the longest average vessel waiting time at 0.4 days each.\u00c2\u00a0\nAmong large ports (4-10M\u00c2\u00a0TEU), Santos added nearly half a day to average anchor times, continuing a trend of worsening conditions at Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest container port. Manila registered a minor improvement but remains far more congested than competing Southeast Asian ports.\u00c2\u00a0\nVancouver (+1.1 days) was the only port to see average anchor times increase by more than a day in September. Houston (+0.5 days), Santos (+0.5 days), Charleston (+0.4 days) and Colombo (+0.4 days) registered the next biggest month-on-month increases. Notably, Chittagong shaved two days off average wait times following the floods and civic action that plagued operations in July and August.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Santos (Brazil)\n\u00a02.5\n\u00a0 +0.5\n\u00a0Manila (Philippines)\n\u00a02.2\n\u00a0-0.1\n\u00a0Savannah (USA)\n\u00a01.1\n\u00a0-0.1\n\u00a0Piraeus (Greece)\n\u00a00.8\n\u00a0NC\n\u00a0Colombo (Sri Lanka)\n\u00a00.5\n\u00a0+0.4\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Durban (South Africa)\n\u00a02.8\n\u00a0 +0.3\n\u00a0Chittagong (Bangladesh)\n\u00a01.9\n\u00a0-2.0\n\u00a0Vancouver (Canada)\n\u00a01.7\n\u00a0+1.1\n\u00a0Lom\u00e9 (Togo)\n\u00a00.9\n\u00a0-0.2\n\u00a0Tema (Ghana)\n\u00a00.9\n\u00a0NC\nContainer Dwell Times: September 2024\nLooking at congestion on the ground, average container dwell times exceeded seven days at 14 of 78 analyzed ports.\u00c2\u00a0\nMedium volume ports in Djibouti (10.0 days), Chittagong (9.3 days) and Guayaquil (8.6 days), took the top three spots. Long Beach recorded the longest container dwell times of North American ports at 8.6 days, while Piraeus topped European ports with 8.5 days.\nXL ports again showed their class with none of the 13 analyzed ports reporting average container dwell times in excess of five days. In fact, Singapore reported the third lowest container dwell times of all 78 ports, at 2.3 days. Shekou, Melbourne, Tanjung Perak and Sydney joined Singapore in the five ports with the lowest average container dwell times in September.\u00c2\u00a0\nOsaka (+4.5 days), Mombasa (+3.0 days), Kobe (+3.0 days), Tanger Med (+2.8 days) and Guayaquil (+2.4 days) recorded the largest month-on-month increases in average container dwell times.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average container dwell time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Long Beach (USA)\n\u00a08.6\n\u00a0+0.1\n\u00a0Piraeus (Greece)\n\u00a08.5\n\u00a0+1.5\n\u00a0Col\u00f3n (Panama)\n\u00a08.4\n\u00a0-0.3\n\u00a0Hai Phong (Vietnam)\n\u00a07.9\n\u00a0+1.6\n\u00a0Tanger Med (Morocco)\n\u00a07.8\n\u00a0+2.8\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average container dwell time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Djibouti (Djibouti)\n\u00a010.0\n\u00a0NC\n\u00a0Chittagong (Bangladesh)\n\u00a09.3\n\u00a0-3.4\n\u00a0Guayaquil (Ecuador)\n\u00a08.6\n\u00a0+2.4\n\u00a0Tema (Ghana)\n\u00a08.4\n\u00a0+0.1\n\u00a0Kingston (Jamaica)\n\u00a07.8\n\u00a0-0.1\nHow We Analyze Port Congestion\nOur port congestion index monitors three key indicators of port congestion. No single factor gives a complete picture of port congestion, but taken collectively these metrics can provide insight into how ports around the world are able to cope with supply chain pressures. \u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAnchor times provide insight into harbor congestion by measuring how long vessels are waiting, on average, before they are able to berth at a port. \n\u00e2\u0080\u008dBerth times provide insight into the time it takes for vessels to be unloaded and loaded. While larger ports typically have longer berth times due to handling larger vessels, looking at changes in berth times month over month can give insight into ports that may be dealing with operational issues. \nWhile the first two factors look at the time it takes for vessels to move through the port, container dwell times give insight into how well ports are facilitating the movement of goods out of the yard and onwards to their final destinations. \nContinue reading\nIn Numbers: The Impact of the Red Sea Crisis on European & Asian Port Congestion\nWebinar Recap: Enhancing Supply Chain Collaboration Through Visibility\nThe Busiest Container Ports in the World\nSubscribe for the latest in supply chain technology.\n"

      "Traffic Signals\nReport a Problem\nTo report a problem with a traffic or pedestrian signal, call 311. Please have the exact location of the problem ready.\nNYC DOT's contractors are required to arrive at the scene of the most serious problems (e.g., all lights out, or a knocked-down pole) within two hours of notification. If a bulb is out, contractors are required to respond within 48 hours.\nAccessible Pedestrian Signals\nNYC DOT installs special signals at crosswalks to assist pedestrians who are blind or have low vision. The signals make sounds and vibrate when pedestrians push a button installed at the crosswalk.\r\n  Learn more and see a list of all accessible pedestrian signals in New York City\nView a list of accessible pedestrian signals on NYC Open Data\nContact NYC DOT online to report a problem or request a new APS\n\nFlashing Yellow Arrow Turn Signals\nTurn signals reduce injuries for pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as improve safety, comfort and mobility for motorists. This video shows two examples of flashing yellow arrow left turn signals in New York City.\n\nSignal Timing\nExclusive Pedestrian Signals\nAt some intersections, NYC DOT programs traffic signals with an interval that stops traffic in all directions, giving pedestrians an exclusive time to cross the street.\r\n  View a list of exclusive pedestrian signals on NYC Open Data\n\nLeading Pedestrian Interval Signals\nTraffic signals at some intersections give pedestrians a head start to cross the street before car traffic. The goal of these signals is to improve street safety by giving pedestrians a chance to begin crossing the street before cars make turns across the crosswalk.\r\n  View a list of leading pedestrian intervals on NYC Open Data\nView the locations of leading pedestrian intervals on the Vision Zero View map\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Traffic Signals\nWhat does a traffic signal do?\nA traffic signal controls the right-of-way for vehicles arriving at an intersection, which can reduce traffic delay and accident-producing conflicts. It also makes an intersection safe by determining whether vehicles or pedestrians should proceed.\nDoes a traffic signal control speed?\nNo. In some areas where speeding is a problem, residents believe that a traffic signal is needed to address the speeding problem. In fact, traffic signals sometimes result in greater speeds as drivers accelerate to try to get through the signal before it turns red. Other traffic control measures, such as speed humps, speed limit signs, and traffic enforcement, are more effective in controlling speed.\nHow many traffic signals are there in New York City?\nAs of March 2022, there were 13,543 intersections with traffic signals citywide, including 2,862 in Manhattan, 1,768 in the Bronx, 4,848 in Brooklyn, 3,432 in Queens and 633 in Staten Island.\nHow long does it take lights to change?\nSignal timing cycle lengths usually fall between 45 and 120 seconds. The timing for each signal is determined based on traffic volume and traffic patterns in each particular area.\nA traffic signal's cycle is too long or too short, will NYC DOT change it?\nSometimes the presence of a traffic signal will result in changes in the previous traffic patterns, as some drivers seek alternative routes to avoid the signal. This may mean that the current signal timing is no longer appropriate. If you believe that the timing of a particular signal is incorrect, contact the NYC DOT Commissioner with your request. NYC DOT will conduct a study of traffic patterns to determine if any adjustments are needed. A study will take approximately 12 weeks.\nHow can I request a new traffic signal?\nYou can request the installation of a traffic signal by writing to the NYC DOT Commissioner. You can also request an accessible pedestrian signal, which plays audible messages to assist visually impaired users.\nHow does NYC DOT decide whether a traffic signal should be installed at an intersection?\nNYC DOT uses a detailed process called an intersection control study to determine if traffic signals or multi-way stop signs are appropriate for a location. The study includes (but is not limited to) these steps:\nWhat are the Federal Guidelines for traffic signals?\nThe federal standards for traffic control devices can be found in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which is published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The MUTCD establishes criteria known as \"warrants\" which are used to determine if a new traffic signal is appropriate.\nThe latest edition of the MUTCD, published in 2009, sets forth nine warrants, which are summarized below.\r\nLearn more about the MUTCD on the FHWA web site\nWhat is the Red Light Camera Program?\nThe Red Light Camera Program uses technology that enables NYC DOT to automatically take high-resolution photographs of vehicles that go through red lights, including close-ups of the license plates. Summonses are issued to the owners of the vehicles, as with parking violations. The photos are included with the summonses. The City had the first full-time red light photographic enforcement program in the United States, and was the first jurisdiction to send photos to respondents as part of the summons.\nAre red light cameras effective in preventing drivers from running red lights?\nStudies have shown a 40 percent decrease in the total number of incidents of motorists going through red lights at the locations where cameras have been installed. That means fewer accidents, making New York City much safer for pedestrians and other motorists.\nSince the Red Light Camera program began in December 1993, more than 4 million summonses have been issued through 2007. Because the summonses include photographs of the vehicle going through the intersection, very few motorists have contested the summonses. About 88% have been found guilty.\nIn April 1998, legislation was enacted that authorized NYC DOT to install cameras at 50 locations throughout New York City. In June 2006, legislation was enacted authorizing an additional 50 cameras. Another 50 cameras, for a total of 150, were authorized in legislation enacted in April 2009.\r\nLearn about paying and contesting red light camera violations from the Department of Finance\n  \n\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n",
      "News\nTotality angst: Dallas-Fort Worth avoids traffic woes during total solar eclipse\nOfficials issued safety notices, warned of emergency-like conditions and shut down major highway ramps into downtown Dallas in advance of the April 8 eclipse.\nBy Maggie Prosser, Philip Jankowski, Amber Gaudet and Irving Mejia-HilarioStaff Writers\nStaff Writers\nEditor\u2019s note: This story is part of The Dallas Morning News\u2019 coverage of the 2024 total solar eclipse. For more, visit dallasnews.com/eclipse.\nAny given day, the Buc-ee\u2019s in Temple serves as a haven for wayward people, weary travelers and commuters headed to or from Austin or Dallas.\nBut on Monday, the chipper Beaver looming over a stretch of Interstate 35 welcomed visitors to the 124-pump, mega pit stop oasis, offering more than smoked brisket, bathrooms and ample parking: The buck-toothed mascot had front-row seats to a once-in-lifetime celestial event.\n\u201cAfter we scouted the area, we went off our checklist. Gas, food, clean bathrooms,\u201d Shannon Murphy, 41, said. \u201cThat\u2019s Buc-ee\u2019s.\u201d\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\nOr with: \nBy signing up you agree to our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy Policy\nA few cars over, Lucy Valedez crocheted a blanket with stripes of sky blue, lilac, sunflower yellow and light green in her camping chair. Lucy and her husband, Jos\u00e9 Valedez, traveled from Bryan.\n\u201cWe figured, if we\u2019re going to travel, we\u2019d go somewhere that had parking,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Valedez said.\nTravel woes gnawed at eclipse goers ahead of the event Monday, prompting officials to issue safety notices, warn of emergency-like conditions, and even shut down major highway on-ramps into downtown Dallas, fearing traffic jams.\nThe angst came and went as quickly as totality: There were no major traffic problems reported Monday in Dallas, even with the influx of visitors and eclipse chasers. Local hospitals did not immediately report any patients with eye injuries. And the state\u2019s energy reserves held steady.\nThe Texas Department of Transportation predicted 1 million people will have visited the Lone Star state for optimal viewing of the total solar eclipse. The path of totality stretched across more than 480 Texas miles, reaching from the Rio Grande to the Red River.\nAll hands on deck at Buc-ee\u2019s\nAt the Buc-ee\u2019s nearly midway between Austin and Dallas, pitmaster Randy Pauly \u2014 donning Wrangler jeans, a cowboy hat and red and blue Buc-ee\u2019s brand shirt stitched with his name \u2014 handed out eclipse glasses to employees.\nMonday was an all-hands-on-deck situation for Buc-ee\u2019s, Pauly said, akin to the busiest travel days as people fanned out across the area of totality chasing clear skies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Super Bowl weekend for us,\u201d he said. Pauly jumped in a photograph with perhaps the most visible staffer at Buc-ee\u2019s: chief of cutting meat, Ginette Cortes, before she carved up a smoked brisket. Pauly said he expected this location to go through at least 100 briskets Monday, topping about 1,000 pounds of smoked beef rolled up into breakfast tacos and other fare.\nPauly said he wants to show out-of-state visitors \u201ca little bit of Texas.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty wild,\u201d Craig Kleine said of the enormous gas station. Kleine, of Tucson, Ariz., was headed about 90 miles north to Cleburne to view the eclipse. Interstate 35 moved freely throughout the morning, as travelers regularly made stops at the Buc-ee\u2019s pumps or inside the store.\nCommuters had yet to feel the effects, even as hundreds of early birds weaved and snaked in lines outside the Dallas Zoo and the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, staked out lawn spots in Dealey Plaza or on the shores of White Rock Lake, and applied sunscreen under cloudy skies while compulsively checking the weather radar.\nLinda Hampton left about 6:15 a.m. and trekked 43 miles down U.S. Highway 75 to the Dallas Arboretum. Traffic on Dallas-area roads and highways remained light Monday morning and throughout totality, according to TxDOT.\nHampton\u2019s early departure wasn\u2019t out of concern for traffic, rather her husband was responsible for the garden\u2019s petting zoo, and top of mind for her and others was whether the dense clouds would soften by 12:20 p.m., when the eclipse began.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy for the sunshine \u2014 yes, yes, yes, yes!,\u201d said an elated Hampton, 75, as the diamond portion of the eclipse peeked out from behind the clouds, providing an aura of optimism. The initial forecast left some forlorn, worrying the moon\u2019s traversal in front of the sun would be obscured. The outlook began to brighten around lunchtime, but storms and severe weather were expected Monday evening.\nMore than 450,000 visitors\nGlobetrotters journeyed from all corners of the region (Garland, Mansfield, Gun Barrel City and Grand Prairie), the country (California, Florida and New York) and even internationally (Colombia, Germany and France) to witness the first total eclipse in North Texas since 1878.\nEarly estimates from city leaders expected up to a 35% increase in visitors, or more than 450,000 people. More accurate counts may not come until later.\nMinnesotans Ralph and Kim Haefner scooped up a vacation rental last February as hotel reservations were filling up. City officials expected 90% of the city\u2019s roughly 35,000 hotel rooms to be booked by Monday.\n\u201cMillions of years from now, as the moon keeps getting slightly farther and farther away from the Earth over time, it\u2019ll be too small to cover the sun,\u201d said Ralph Haefner, an eclipse chaser. The couple spent early Monday scoping out the best view at Bachman Lake. \u201cIt\u2019s just this weird little coincidence that you can see this amazing spectacle.\u201d\nAstronomy student Andr\u00e9s Torres, 21, traveled to Dallas from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, by way of Miami and Austin to fulfill his dream of witnessing a total eclipse. From Founders Plaza in downtown Dallas, Torres propped up a professional telescope on a tripod.\n\u201cIt was a long trip,\u201d he said. \u201c[The eclipse] is already starting, I\u2019m so excited.\u201d\nAs the eclipse began, Donnie, a 5-year-old pit bull, took refuge under trees and patchy shade near Reunion Tower. Donnie, with his humans Mark Ebanks and Autumn Flowers in tow, made the 14-hour trip from Jacksonville, Fla., on Sunday, arriving in Dallas just after 2 a.m. Monday.\nThe trip was spontaneous, \u201cspur of the moment,\u201d said Ebanks, who didn\u2019t know about the eclipse until Flowers, a self-described space nerd, told him about it last week.\nDonnie, Ebanks and Flowers planned to drive back to Florida after totality ended. They hadn\u2019t given much thought to traffic concerns, other than a potential stop in Louisiana for crawfish.\n\u2018Rolling\u2019 closures of highway exits\nDallas police issued temporary rolling closures of highway exits headed into downtown from about 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. in anticipation of traffic jams as totality ended and people left their viewing spots en masse. Despite the closures, traffic flowed smoothly after the eclipse and there were no issues to report, according to a Dallas police spokesperson.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see a dramatic increase in traffic right after the totality, and I think that indicates that people were just preparing themselves to stay a little bit later and avoid some of that traffic,\u201d Texas Department of Transportation spokesperson Tony Hartzel said.\nThe state\u2019s most critical infrastructure also held strong during the total solar eclipse. ERCOT\u2019s grid never dipped below normal operating conditions during the entirety of the eclipse, a spokesperson told The Dallas Morning News.\nThe state\u2019s top hospitals, including Parkland Health, Baylor Scott & White Health and Methodist Health System, did not report an increase in new patients because of the eclipse Monday afternoon.\nCloud cover at Buc-ee\u2019s\nThe Buc-ee\u2019s pitstop filled with more than 200 people in camping chairs and on picnic blankets; totality came and went with some tension. With minutes to go until full moon cover, low-flying dark clouds blocked visibility. People took off their eclipse glasses amid worried groans as they tried to catch the sliver of the sun as the sky darkened.\nThen, less than a minute before totality, the clouds cleared, the sky darkened and cheers rang out. People settled into their awe and quietly marveled at the orange horizon clearly visible from all sides of the flat, field-lined gargantuan parking lot. A few planets were seen near the sun while the temperature dipped and the solar corona became visible.\n\u201cIt just makes me remember there is so much going on out there,\u201d said Kelsey Appleton, an Atlanta resident there with her parents, Bob and Margaret Appleton, from College Station. \u201cI\u2019m just a part of it.\u201d\n\u201cI just felt like this might be the only chance in my life to see one,\u201d Bob Appleton said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful.\u201d\nWithin 30 minutes, the vast majority of spectators of the cosmic event had left, leaving to clear traffic.\nStaff writers Maria Halkias, Leah Waters, Anna Butler, Nicholas Wooten and Marcela Rodrigues contributed to this report.\nMaggie writes about public safety and criminal courts.

      "Miracle on Ashland Avenue: Despite past pushback from neighbors, bus line will be extended north to Ravenswood Metra\nThe route will run for about a mile north of Irving, opening up new commuting options and making it easier to access more jobs and businesses.\n9:21 PM CDT on May 27, 2024\nThe promised land for Ashland Avenue bus riders: Looking north from the northernmost northbound bus stop  on Ashland at Irving Park Road (4000 N.), towards the future bus service area on Ashland. \nUpdate 5/28/24, 3:40 PM: Today 47th Ward Chief of Staff Joshua Mark told Streetsblog that the new bus service on Ashland north of Irving Park will be launched in the late summer. \"I'll let CTA share the date at the meeting.\"\nThey said it couldn't be done! And to be honest, I was a little skeptical myself.\nIt seemed highly unlikely that Chicago would ever extend the Ashland Avenue [1600 W.] bus corridor further than its current northernmost stop on Ashland at Irving Park Road [4000 N.] Some neighbors north of Irving have long opposed converting a few car-parking spots on the avenue to bus stops. They also made dubious claims that CTA traffic would damage their homes' foundations. Read more about that issue at the end of this 2013 Streetsblog Chicago article.\nBut on Friday, local Ald. Matt Martin's (47th) newsletter announced  that the dream is becoming a reality.\nSo how did this victory for straphangers come to be? Ald. Martin's chief of staff Joshua Mark provided some background in the following discussion. We talked last week, but the ward asked Streetsblog to hold off on publicizing the news before it was shared with constituents. The interview has been edited slightly for clarity and brevity.\nJoshua Mark: [During an interview for another recent piece on the new campaign for bus rapid transit on Western Avenue (2400 W.)] We have gotten the CTA to extend the Ashland bus north on Ashland.\nJohn Greenfield: OK cool. [It took a moment for the significance of that statement to kick in.] Wow! How the heck did you do that? There were so many neighbors who were dead-set against it. Aren't people going to complain about losing car parking spots and ruining their foundations? How were you able to do something about that? Are there enough people living on Ashland north of Irving nowadays who want bus service?\nJM: Yes, there are a lot of people living on Ashland who want it. We have not encountered any public push-back.\nJG: Terrific. Please tell me more about the plan.\nJM: Obviously the Ashland bus currently does not go north of Irving Park. It instead makes a right on Irving and then terminates on Clark Street [about 1400 W. here] and Belle Plaine Avenue [4100 N.] It currently terminates in front of Graceland Cemetery. \nThe CTA has found that, although they're making it work, the current layover with the [protected/raised] bike lane on Clark [at Belle Plaine], they don't love it. It's a little too narrow and it's a little too much work. They were interested finding another place for their layovers.\nWe worked with them to identify a location for a new layover zone. So we eventually landed with them on extending the bus route to the Ravenswood Metra station. What this would mean is that the CTA bus will go north of Irving Park. It will go until Wilson Avenue [4600 N.] It will take a left on Wilson. Then it will take a right onto Ravenswood Avenue [1800 W.] and it will terminate in front of the Metra station. \nThis is not a massive extension of the route further north. It is around a mile. And this is fully within our ward. I would have, of course, loved for the CTA to agree to extend it further, but this is where they were willing to go. And we think the new route will not make a world of difference, but it will make a big difference for those who are impacted.\nThe CTA calculates that an additional 21,000 residents are going to now live within a half mile of the Ashland bus, which is obviously a huge change. And the Ashland bus is going to come now to within a half mile of an additional 15,000 jobs. It is going to allow for connections between the Ashland bus and the 78 Montrose bus, as well as the 81 Lawrence bus at the Metra station.\nThat's not to mention the connection to the Metra station itself, meaning that the bus will unlock a new commuting pattern for anyone heading downtown. If they live, say, near Lakeview High School [at Irving Park/Ashland], they could now get downtown by taking the Ashland bus north to Metra and then taking the train down if they wanted to. And, of course, it allows folks to go north on Metra to Ravinia or Waukegan. \nJG: Where will the bus stops be?\nJM: [Heading north on Ashland] there will be a bus stop at Irving Park, a bus stop at Berteau Avenue [4200 N.], and at Montrose, which will allow folks to have new access to businesses, including restaurants. For example, there's a Venezuelan place [BienMeSabe, 1637 W. Montrose Ave.]\nThen there's going to be a stop on Wilson and Ashland, where the bus makes the left. And there will be a stop at Wilson and Hermitage Avenue [1700 W.] And that will be it until the terminus at the Metra station. The layover zone is going to be between Leland Avenue [4700 N.] and Lawrence on the east side of Ravenswood, by the [ExtraSpace] storage facility.\nThe bus is going to stop very much in the middle of the block. Obviously a layover zone involves multiple buses. So it will take over one side of the street, the southern half. People will get out and they will be in the middle of the block. Depending on where they get off, they could enter the Metra station on either side.\nJG: Then what will the bus driver do?\nJM: That's the end of the line. So the new run will go north on Ravenswood, it will take a right on Lawrence, and then take another right to head south on Ashland. They're doing bus stops at every other block [a quarter mile between stops], so southbound it's going to be Lawrence, Wilson, Montrose, Berteau, and then Irving Park.\nI've been speaking to neighbors' associations to give them a heads-up. Personally, I used to live on Ashland north of Ainslie Avenue [4900 N.], so I would have take to Divvy [bike-share] down to the Divvy station at Ashland and Belle Plaine and then walk to Ashland and Irving to catch the Ashland bus.\nWhen I lived near Ashland and Ainslie, I had neighbors tell me we lived in a transit desert. That is a laughable statement when you consider that Ainslie is two blocks south of the Foster bus, one block west of the Clark bus, three blocks northeast of the Ravenswood Metra station, and two blocks north of the Lawrence bus.\nI still thought it was significant for people to say that, because when you're looking for that north-south connection, it is really an exception in Chicago to live off of a major street like Ashland and to not have access to a bus. And it makes it more difficult to have that easy north-south connection. [Clark Street runs northwest-southeast, so 2.25 miles south of Ainslie at Barry Avenue (3100 N.), Clark is located a mile east of Ashland at Halsted Street (800 W.)]\nIt's going to make a big difference for people and, in addition to just extending the line to more folks, it's about giving access to more places. As it stands, the bus layover zone is really in a no-man's land. It's in front of a vacant 7-11 (although that 7-11 may be reused soon, if you've been following the 46th Ward zoning process). It's in front of a cemetery. If you draw a circular line around the stop, that means that half the catchment area is not [living] people, it's a cemetery.\nSo we're bringing it to more people, but it also means that the bus line ends at the Metra station, at the Lawrence bus, at the Mariano's [supermarket], at LA Fitness, McPherson elementary school is nearby, and there are bars and businesses. It's really about expanding what the Ashland bus can take you to.\nYou can attend the online-only community meeting on the project on Thursday, June 6 at 6 PM.

      "\u201cNew Normal\u201d of 10am to 4pm Hybrid Work While Congestion Grows Globally\nToday INRIX launched the 2023 INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard, our 18th annual release, including a Q1 2024 update. The Scorecard tracks, measures and analyzes traffic congestion in 947 urban areas worldwide, providing insights for road authorities, transportation engineers, policymakers, and the public.\nTraffic congestion occurs when travel demand for roads exceeds the supply of available roadway. While typically viewed in a negative light, traffic congestion is an externality of economic growth and population movement. As more people and economic activity move into urban areas, it places strain on available road capacity, requiring intervention if there is a desire to ameliorate it.\nAdditionally, increased levels of traffic congestion mean more people, deliveries, employees, service workers and truckers, among others, losing time to traffic. It means more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, a reduction in air quality, and lost productivity and economic growth.\nWhile congestion is one barometer of growth, it can also hinder it. Fewer on-time deliveries, fewer goods to market, and a shrinking labor pool are just some outcomes when the impact of traffic congestion hits a certain threshold. While cities, DOTs, road authorities and transit operators work within constrained budgets and red tape, maintenance backlogs grow and key transportation bottlenecks grow more intense.\nHere are the key trends from this year\u2019s Global Traffic Scorecard:\nTrip patterns reveal massive midday \u201c10-4\u201d peak continues. Travel patterns have continued to push toward a midday \u201cnew-normal,\u201d first noted by INRIX back in 2021, that shows morning peak periods have shed some traffic to the midday hours, indicating a more \u201chybrid work\u201d commute pattern.\nINRIX estimates that during the midday travel period, nearly 72 million trips occur per hour, up nearly 23% since 2019, while the evening peak has dropped -9% to 73 million trips per hour. The typical hour during the morning peak sees -12% fewer trips.\nThis should continue to be a key focus of DOT officials and road authorities. Whether adjusting signal timing, adjusting transit schedules or allocating incident response vehicles, the move from the morning peak hours to the midday provides an interesting opportunity reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions.\nTraffic congestion continues to climb. 2023 saw increases in traffic congestion in 78% of the areas analyzed, fell in 19% and stayed the same in 3%. Yet despite the growth, just 54% of areas analyzed have reached their pre-COVID level of traffic congestion.\nMore Time and Economic Impact. The New York Urban Area tops the list, as the typical drivers lost 101 hours to traffic in 2023. This equates to $1,762 in lost time per driver, or $9.1 billion to the urban area. New York is followed by Mexico City (96 hours lost), London (99), Paris (97) and Chicago (96).\nThe typical U.S. driver lost 42 hours to congestion, equal to $733 per driver and $70.4 to the nation as a whole. U.K. drivers lost 61 hours on average, equal to \u00a3558 per driver and \u00a37.5 billion nationally, and drivers in Germany lost 40 hours to traffic on average in 2023, equal to 427 \u20ac and 3.3 billion \u20ac nationally.\nOther important transport statistics/topics. Overall micromobility use rose 8.3% in cities tracked by RideReport, and by Q1 2024 were up 8.6% over Q1 2023.\nThe year saw a couple of high-profile transportation disasters, from fires underneath the I-10 in Los Angeles to the I-95 collapse in Philadelphia. This was followed in 2024 by the collapse of the Key Bridge near Baltimore after it was struck by a cargo ship. However, the quick response of a temporary span on I-95 just a few weeks after the collapse provided a testament to our ability to build and recover.\nMigration continued on a similar path as the COVID recovery in the U.S. as well, with Texas, Florida and the Southern states accounting for 87% of the country\u2019s growth last year.\nPublic transport recovered ridership in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, but all still sit below their pre-COVID levels of ridership. Just seven percent of urban areas in the U.S. tracked by the Federal Transit Administration reached 2019 levels of ridership.\nConclusion\nMany trends are still being ironed out from the massive global disruption that COVID had on the transportation network. Traffic congestion continues to climb while new challenges emerge that also demand attention. The Scorecard reveals the contextual nature of transportation \u2013 its simply not a one size fits all approach. Some cities see trips to downtown stand pat while others see large increases. Many see traffic congestion building on arterials and neighborhood streets while others reveal stronger similarities to more traditional, \u201chub and spoke\u201d travel demand.\n"

The average driver in the Los Angeles area spent 119 hours in rush hour traffic, according to the most recent data from the University of Austin, Texas\u2019 2019 Mobility Report. Three decades ago, the average LA driver spent 66 hours a year in traffic. The 2017 congestion numbers post an 80 percent increase in average hours a year for drivers stuck in traffic.\r\n \r\nWhile LA is famous for its traffic, this is not an LA-specific issue, with cities and towns both big and small posting significant increases in congestion over the past three-plus decades. An expanding nation and, as a result, a growing workforce are both factors at play in the increasing congestion plaguing American roadways. Since 1982, there are 50 percent more people in the workforce, and while people are increasingly working from home, most are still commuting to office space during peak hours. The only year-over-year decrease in congestion was between 2008 and 2009 when the U.S. economy was reeling from the worst economic contraction and high unemployment, the country had seen since the Great Depression.\r\n  \r\nPeople on the roadways pay for this congestion through their time, but the economy pays for these delays through costly inefficiencies. The annual cost of traffic delays per commuter has nearly doubled, rising to $1,010. That is nearly double what it was in the early 1980s.\r\n\n                            \n\n                                        Description\n                                    \n\n                                        This chart shows the annual average hours of delay per commuter during peak hours by U.S. cities.\n                                    \n\n                                            Report\n                                        \n\n                \n                    Can I integrate infographics into my blog or website?\n                \n            \n\n                \n                    Yes, Statista allows the easy integration of many infographics on other websites.

      "Boston Subway Map 2024 \u2013 Timetable, Tickets & Prices\n  \nSubway Boston (MTBA) \u2013 The route network\nThe Boston subway is a true monument to American history. The metro system is the oldest subway in the USA. It opened on September 1, 1887, just before the Chicago subway.\nOpened at the time as the \u201cStreet Subway\u201d, the route is still part of the so-called Green Line with the oldest subway tunnel in the USA. Alongside the three modern metro lines, it is a special feature on the Boston Metro Map. The Green Line is actually an S-Bahn line, but a large part of it runs underground. At 37 kilometers, it is not only the longest, but also the busiest subway line in Boston, carrying around 230,000 passengers a day.\nAll lines are operated by Massachusetts Bay Transportation (MBTA). The subway network, affectionately known by Bostonians as \u201cThe T\u201d or \u201cBoston T\u201d, stretches over a total length of around 120.3 kilometers. With 200,000 passengers per day, the Orange Line has the second largest passenger volume after the Green Line. The metro lines on the Boston Metro Map can only be distinguished by their color. To avoid confusion with other public transport lines, travelers should therefore remember the Red Line, the Blue Line, the Orange Line and the Green Line.\nInhaltsverzeichnis\nThe Boston subway lines at a glance\nInformation for tourists about the Boston Metro\nBoston owes its popularity as a travel destination and place to work and study not least to its famous universities. Harvard University and the New England Conservatory are particularly famous. However, it is not just students and commuters who use the transportation services of the \u201cBoston T\u201d. There are also plenty of tourists who want to see historically significant sites such as the Old State House, the Freedom Trail, Faneuil Hall or the USS Constitution.\nAccordingly, the number of people in Boston who use the Metro Map is also increasing. This is comparatively easy to accomplish due to the small number of lines. The most important connection for tourists is undoubtedly the Blue Line between the airport and the city center at the Government Center stop.\nBoston subway tickets & prices\nWith a population of just over 600,000, Boston is not exactly a small town. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the tariff system is very reminiscent of this. Instead of a complex system with several tariff zones, a flat-rate billing system is used. This also makes it much easier for non-residents to use the metro in Boston. This also limits the choice of tickets to a minimum.\nThey are valid for both the subway and the bus lines. In addition to one-way tickets, the operating company MTBA only offers daily, weekly and monthly tickets. Tickets are cheaper for senior citizens, the disabled and students. Boston\u2019s subway is also very family-friendly. Children up to the age of 11 can travel free of charge on the metro.\nThe most important metro tickets in Boston\nIf you want to buy a metro ticket in Boston, you have several options. The most common option is to buy classic paper tickets, known as Charlie tickets. They are available from the ticket machines in front of the entrances to the subway platforms. If there is no ticket machine and validator to be found on a subway platform, tickets can often also be purchased on board the trains. However, only tickets with a value of up to 20 US dollars can be purchased at the ticket machines on board.\nUsing the CharlieCard is much more convenient. This is a rechargeable chip card that can be used to book tickets and also serves as a travel pass. It can be used as a one-way ticket, day ticket, weekly ticket and monthly ticket. The CharlieCard is particularly attractive because of the discount on the price of single trips. The CharlieCard is also validated or activated at the electronic access barriers to the platforms. There are no smartphone tickets for the metro in Boston, nor are there any special combined tickets for tourists. Such tickets are usually associated with discounts for attractions.\nBoston subway schedule\nThe Green Line starts its service at around 5:00 am. Service on the three remaining lines on the Boston Metro Map begins between 5:15 and 5:30 a.m. This regulation applies on the Green Line and Blue Line seven days a week. On the Red Line and the Orange Line, however, the first trains on Sundays do not depart until an hour later at around 6:00 am. Both during the week and at weekends, all lines run until around 1:00 a.m. or 1:30 a.m. at night.\nThe frequency of the four metro lines on the Boston Metro Map varies throughout the day between a 3-minute interval during rush hour and a 9-15-minute interval in the late evening and night hours. So if you want to be out and about in Boston after 1:00 a.m., you have to use one of the city\u2019s many cabs or the Uber service.\nRed Line, Orange Line, Blue Line, Green Line\nFurther information on the Boston Metro\nThe saying \u201cother countries, other customs\u201d applies not only to the USA in general, but also to the metro in Boston. There are some rules that may seem strange to the average European at first. Eating on the Boston subway is not prohibited, but if the food smells too strong, the employees of the operating company can issue a warning. Incidentally, no one should put up any resistance, as these employees are official security guards from the MBTA Police Department.\nSo safety on board is also well taken care of. Very loud conversations that disturb the other passengers are also worthy of a warning. Playing music loudly is prohibited both at subway stations and on the trains themselves. No less unusual is the clear permission to put your feet up on the seat, provided the subway carriage is largely empty.\n (No Ratings Yet)Loading...\n",

Provisional estimates are published quarterly and remain provisional until after they have been constrained by the final annual estimates each year. These provisional estimates are based on traffic data collected continuously from a network of around 300 automatic traffic counters. Final annual figures also incorporate manual traffic count data.\nTraffic shows a seasonal pattern at the national level, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. This publication focuses on rolling annual traffic totals, which better illustrate medium and long term trends in traffic.\nAnnual traffic estimates are usually published between May and June of the following year. The next provisional figures, for the year ending June 2024, are due to be released in September 2024.\nThese are accredited official statistics[footnote 1] and were independently reviewed by the Office for Statistics Regulation in February 2013. For more information, see the background information on provisional road traffic estimates.\nHeadline figures\nOverall traffic levels in the year ending March 2024 were higher than in year ending March 2023 and below pre-pandemic levels.\nChart 1: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 1 is a line chart showing that 332.4 billion vehicle miles were driven on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was up 2.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motor vehicle traffic levels fell during the pandemic but have since increased. This is the case for all vehicle types and road types. Traffic levels for the year ending March 2024 were 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\nRoad traffic by vehicle type\nChart 2: Share of traffic by vehicle type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 2 is a bar chart which shows that cars accounted for 76% of all motor vehicle traffic on Great Britain\u2019s roads over the year ending March 2024. Therefore, cars continue to be the main contributor to changes in overall motor vehicle traffic.\nThe proportion of van traffic has increased in recent years, accounting for 18% of all motor vehicle traffic in this 12 month period.\nLorries accounted for 5% of all motor vehicle traffic and 1% of traffic came from other motor vehicles including motorcycles and buses.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 1: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by vehicle type in the year ending March 2024, and percentage change compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2501a)\nTable 1 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different vehicle types. For example, car and taxi traffic was 2.6% higher in the year ending March 2024 than the year ending March 2023. Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nCars and taxis\nChart 3: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by cars and taxis in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 3 is a line chart which illustrates that cars and taxis travelled 252.5 billion vehicle miles in the 12 months ending March 2024. Car and taxi traffic rose 2.6% from the year ending March 2023. Car and taxi miles for the year ending March 2024 were down by 4.0% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nVans (Light Commercial Vehicles - LCVs)\nChart 4: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by vans in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 4 is a line chart which shows that 58.2 billion vehicle miles were driven by vans on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was a rise of 1.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Van distance travelled for the year ending March 2024 was 8.8% higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nLorries (Heavy Goods Vehicles - HGVs)\nChart 5: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by lorries in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 5 is a line chart showing that 16.9 billion vehicle miles were driven by lorries on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. Lorry traffic decreased by 2.0% compared to the year ending March 2023. Distance covered by lorries for the year ending March 2024 was 1.7% below pre-pandemic levels. The chart shows that the pandemic had a lesser effect on total lorry traffic than other vehicle types. Between the years ending December 2019 and December 2020, lorry traffic only fell by 5.9%, while car and van traffic fell by 24.9% and 9.2% respectively.\nRoad traffic by road type\nChart 6: Share of traffic by road type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 6 is a bar chart displaying that on Great Britain\u2019s roads, in the year ending March 2024, 21% of motor vehicle miles travelled were on motorways, 44% on \u2018A\u2019 roads, and 35% on minor roads. 65% of motor vehicle miles travelled were on major roads (motorways and \u2018A\u2019 roads) despite comprising only 13% of the road network by length.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 2: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by road type in the year ending March 2024 compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2502a)\nTable 2 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different road types.

This was an increase of 1.9% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motorway traffic for the year ending March 2024 was similar to pre-pandemic levels.\n\u2018A\u2019 roads\nChart 8: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on \u2018A\u2019 roads in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 8 is a line chart which shows 146.5 billion vehicle miles were driven on \u2018A\u2019 roads in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This represents a 2.6% rise from the year ending March 2023. Traffic on \u2018A\u2019 roads for the year ending March 2024 was 2.5% lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nMinor roads\nChart 9: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on minor roads in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 9 is a line chart showing that 115.8 billion vehicle miles were driven on minor roads in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024.

All of this and more, for less than your daily cup of coffee.\nSeveral Subway Lines Will Provide Increased Service Beginning This Summer\nThe four-phase project will offer straphangers more frequent train service, and phase one begins this July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Brianna Perry - Staff Writer\t\t\t\t\u2022\nMay 9, 2023\n\nMany of our public transport-inducing headaches are (hopefully) going to be addressed beginning this summer!\nAs part of the Fiscal Year 2024 New York State Budget\u2019s agreement to address key priorities and make New York more affordable, livable and safer, $35 million from the budget will go to the MTA for subway service enhancements.\nThe weekend changes are expected to benefit an estimated 2.9 million subway riders, while about 800,000 riders are expected to benefit from the weekday enhancements.\nThe first phase of these enhancements are expected to begin this July, beginning with a weekend service increase in Brooklyn and Queens on the G, J, and M lines. The increase entails trains arriving every 8 to 9 minutes compared to their current schedule of every 10 to 11 minutes.\nPhase two begins in August, with a weekday midday service increase on the C, N, and R lines, which will cut train wait times by 2 minutes. Train service frequency will also increase on the 1 and 6 lines on weekends, with trains arriving every 6 minutes instead of every 8.\nIncreased train frequency will most definitely be a welcome sight this summer, as we all know how miserable the subway gets in the heat, especially considering the subway saw over one billion riders last year.\nBy December phase three will begin, which will increase weekday evening service on the C, N, and R lines as well as midday service on the G line. Trains on these lines will arrive every 8 minutes under the enhanced service.\n6-minute service on the 1 and 6 lines during the weekend will also be extended during this phase to encompass more hours of the day.\nFinally, the fourth and final phase will begin in July 2024. During this phase, weekday and evening service will increase on the B, D, J, and M lines with trains arriving every 8 minutes. The 3 and 5 lines will also see increased weekend service with trains arriving every 10 minutes.\n\u201cThe subway is the lifeblood of New York City, and that is why in this year\u2019s state budget we made sure to deliver the necessary funding not just to shore up the MTA\u2019s financing, but to enhance service as well,\u201d said State Senator Liz Krueger.\nIn addition to the increased service, NYC\u2019s Re-NEW-vation Program aims to renovate a total of 50 subway stations by the end of 2023.\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\nDiscover our cities\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\n\n\nTYPE IN YOUR SEARCH AND PRESS ENTER\nNo result\n"

      "An X inside this box indicates no flooding occurred within this Hydrologic Service Area.\nNear to above-normal precipitation was observed across Upper Michigan during April when WFO Marquette, Manistique, and Munising all recorded more than 150% of normal precipitation (Table 1, Figure 6). A wintry storm on April 2-4 brought the large majority of Upper Michigan\u2019s monthly snowfall and a wetter storm tracked across the region April 28-29. Percent of normal year-to-date precipitation increased at each observation site relative to March values (Table 2) signaling a continuation of the transition to above-normal precipitation that began in March. Temperatures trended closer to average during April, but all observations sites remain in the top 10 warmest January-April periods with temperature anomalies of +3\u00b0F to +7\u00b0F (Table 3). Despite the wetter pattern, the very warm start to the year melted the paltry seasonal snowpack during March resulting in much below-normal streamflow for most of Upper Michigan\u2019s waterways during April (Figures 1-3). Warmth also maintained drought conditions, mainly across portions of western Upper Michigan where deficits in soil moisture continue to linger, but have improved since March (Figures 4, 7-9).

      "Watch CBS News\nWaymo now available to anyone in Los Angeles\n\n    By\n                        \n                      Marissa Wenzke\n\n\nUpdated on:  November 13, 2024 / 9:09 AM PST\n          / KCAL News\n        \nWaymo One, the driverless ride-hailing app, is now available to anyone in Los Angeles after previously only offering LA rides to those on a waiting list.\nWhat started out as a secret project at Google has become a robotaxi service available in Phoenix, San Francisco, and now Los Angeles. On Tuesday, the company announced the Waymo One app will be available to an 80-square-mile swath of greater LA \u2014 including Santa Monica, Hollywood and parts of South LA around the USC campus, among surrounding areas.  \nWith no one in the driver's seat, Waymo One's vehicles are fully autonomous, with the fleet made up entirely of fully electric Jaguar I-PACEs. Like rideshare apps such as Uber and Lyft, riders can hail a car 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u00a0\n\"Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,\" Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a statement announcing the expansion into LA. \"Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We're so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can't wait to serve more riders soon.\"\nWaymo started out in Los Angeles with rides only available to people on a waiting list, which nearly 300,000 people ended up joining, according to the company. Waymo claims those rides resulted in an average rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars, with LA riders who were surveyed reporting 98% of them are satisfied with the service and 96% saying it was useful.\nThe company initially launched in San Francisco after getting approval from state regulators last year to charge for rides, after first offering its service in Phoenix\u00a0beginning in 2020. Waymo rides in the Arizona city are available across a 315-square-mile area.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Transportation, reports fully-autonomous vehicles such as Waymo's robotaxi service can have some safety benefits as these cars may be able to detect threats of crashes humans don't.

      "Disruptive Transportation: The Adoption, Utilization, and Impacts of Ride-Hailing in the United States\nRide-hailing adoption has far outpaced other shared mobility modes\nRide-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft are changing the way many people travel in major cities. Due to their rapid rise in popularity, relatively light levels of regulation, and lack of available data on how, when, and why people use these services, city and transportation planners and researchers know alarmingly little about how ride-hailing is changing travel choices or how to plan for them in the future.\nNearly 10 years after these services were introduced, we still have limited research and few answers to key questions, including: To what extent do ride-hailing services influence vehicle ownership? Where is ride-hailing complementary to or competitive with public transit?\nMany public agencies responsible for transportation planning in the United States \u2014 typically metropolitan planning organizations and state transportation and environmental agencies \u2014 conduct travel surveys to gather data on vehicle ownership rates, trip-making patterns, and transportation mode choice. However, these custom surveys are costly and typically administered only every five to 10 years, which is not frequent enough given our rapidly changing transportation ecosystem. To address this gap in knowledge, our research has sought to better understand the relationships among ride-hailing services, demographics, and travel behavior.\nTo begin quantifying the adoption and travel behavior impacts of these services, we gathered data in major metropolitan areas of the United States through travel surveys designed by our team. Our survey asked questions about the adoption and utilization of shared mobility services, including carsharing, ride-hailing, bikeshare, and more recently, shared electric scooters. The results presented in our 2017 research report are based on data that were collected from fall 2015 through spring 2016 in seven metropolitan areas: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. We employed sampling methods that regional planning agencies typically use to gather data from a statistically representative sample using rigorous methods so that we could draw defensible conclusions about the population at large.\nShared mobility: A diversifying landscape\nMuch of prior research on the behavioral impacts of shared mobility services focused on what we term \u201cCarsharing 1.0,\u201d\u200aearly models of carsharing where vehicles were picked up and returned to the same location, typically through hourly rentals. The shared mobility landscape has rapidly evolved and new services have been introduced, including free-floating car-sharing, ride-hailing (e.g. Uber and Lyft), and pooled or shared services (Table 1). A key takeaway from our recent research is that not all shared services should be viewed through this lens and that the adoption rates and behavioral impacts of different types of shared mobility services vary substantially.\nTable 1. The evolution of shared mobility services\n\nAmong these various forms of shared mobility, the rates of ride-hailing adoption have far outpaced the adoption rates of other shared mobility models. Carsharing 1.0 business models had attracted only 2 million members in North America and close to 5 million globally between the early 2000s and 2017. By contrast, ride-hailing services, such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi, are estimated to have grown to more than 250 million users globally during the 2010s alone. Our more recent research on \u201cmicromobility\u201d services, such as shared bikes, electric bikes, and electric scooters, finds that the adoption rates of these services have grown at an even faster pace than for ride-hailing.\nAdoption of ride-hailing\nThe adoption rates, or share of the population that has used Uber or Lyft, in our study were significantly higher than those reported in previous research. While earlier studies found adoption rates of 10 to 15 percent, our 2015\u20132016 data found that 21 percent of adults had personally used ride-hailing services (measured as having installed and used a ride-hailing app), and an additional 9 percent of adults had used ride-hailing with friends. Our different results are likely due to our focus on major metropolitan areas and suggest that ride-hailing service use is increasingly widespread, particularly compared with adoption rates of previous generation carsharing services, which are roughly an order of magnitude smaller.\nSimilar to the higher ride-hailing adoption rates, we also found higher rates of utilization, or frequency of use, among ride-hailing users in cities. Nearly a quarter (24 percent) of ride-hailing users reported use on a daily to weekly basis. Such a significant portion of people relying on these services daily or weekly suggests that ride-hail is shifting from a niche to a mainstream travel option in many cities.\nSimilar to the adoption trends for new technologies and prior carsharing services, we found that early ride-hailing adopters tended to be younger, more educated, and have higher incomes than the rest of the population (Figure 1). Notably, we find women and minorities were more likely to adopt ride-hailing. There was a fairly significant gap in adoption between the youngest and oldest segments of the population. More than one-third (36 percent) of those between 18 and 29 years of age had used ride-hailing services, while only 4 percent of those 65 and older had. Although ride-hailing is often cited as a possible transportation solution for aging Baby Boomers, our research suggests very few of them currently utilize services like Uber and Lyft.\n\nMore than a third of 18- to 29-year-olds had used ride-hailing services, while only 4 percent of those 65 and older had.\n\nFigure 1. Ride-hailing adoption by demographics and geography, 2015-2016\n\nWealthier, more educated people use Uber and Lyft at much higher rates than those who are less affluent. The adoption rate among the college educated (26 percent) was double that of those without a college degree (13 percent). Those with advanced degrees also had slightly higher adoption rates than those with only a bachelor\u2019s degree. Similarly, respondents with annual household incomes of $150,000 or more had an adoption rate of 33 percent, compared with only 15 percent among those earning $35,000 or less.\nWhile many observers herald these exciting new mobility options, their continuing growth presents significant challenges for the public sector. As officials and managers at cities and public transit agencies consider whether and how to integrate these services into publicly subsidized transportation networks, these gaps in adoption between the wealthy and the poor need to be addressed.\nVehicle ownership and driving\nTwo important questions facing transportation policymakers are whether the adoption of ride-hailing services might reduce vehicle ownership and total vehicle miles traveled. Contrary to prior research on the topic, we found that ride-hailing users on average do not own significantly fewer vehicles than their non-ride-hailing counterparts. We find, as others have, that the key drivers of vehicle ownership are household income, household structure, and urban density, the latter of which is strongly correlated with limited parking. Once these factors have been statistically controlled, we observe little difference in vehicle ownership between those who use ride-hailing and those who do not.\nWhen asked whether using Uber or Lyft had prompted them to decrease their ownership of motor vehicles, the vast majority of ride-hailing respondents (91 percent) reported making no vehicle ownership changes, while 16 percent indicated they had no vehicle to begin with. However, nearly one in 10 respondents (9 percent) said they had downsized by one or more household vehicles, which suggests that Uber and Lyft may indeed motivate long-range changes to vehicle ownership and use decisions.\nFrom an environmental perspective, a significant shift away from personal vehicle ownership is primarily of value inasmuch as it reduces vehicle-related emissions. While vehicle travel is correlated with emissions, the effect of ride-hailing on total vehicle travel is the subject of ongoing debate.\nWe found a strong correlation between reduced vehicle ownership and increased ride-hailing use (Figure 2). This suggests that such travelers are substituting trips in which they would have driven themselves with trips that are now driven by an Uber or Lyft driver.\nFigure 2. Vehicle shedding by ride-hailing utilization rate\n\nAs we ponder the future introduction of shared, automated vehicles, trip-making and travel mode choice (i.e., walk, bike, transit, carpool, drive, ride-hail, etc.) will be central to determining whether their introduction will result in more miles traveled, more congestion, and more energy use, or whether they will be deployed to provide mobility benefits with fewer negative social, economic, and environmental impacts.\nImpacts of ride-hailing on public transit\nThe extent to which ride-hailing complements or substitutes for public transit use will play a key role in whether Uber, Lyft, and potential automated vehicle services increase or decrease total vehicle travel. We addressed this question by assuming that not all public transit services are created equal. Some transit services are more frequent, reliable, and operate in environments where they are an especially convenient choice, while other services operating in less \u201ctransit-friendly\u201d areas can be slow and inconvenient. In short, the question of whether ride-hailing competes with or complements public transit services depends on the context.\nWe asked survey respondents whether they use different public transit services, including buses, subways, and streetcars, more or less after they began using Uber and Lyft. The majority of respondents reported no change in their transit use. However, among the few who did report changing transit use, 6 percent said that they used bus services less and 3 percent said they used light rail (i.e., streetcars) less. By contrast, 3 percent of respondents reported increasing their use of commuter rail, which typically carries commuters longer distances from suburbs to central business districts. In short, we find that the substitutive versus complementary nature of ride-hailing services varies by the location, type, and quality of the transit service in question.\nRecent research on New York City finds that travel has shifted away from public transit towards ride-hailing. So while many suggest that ride-hailing can be complementary to public transit by making it easier to get to and from transit stops and stations, there is mounting evidence that ride-hailing is pulling more people away from public transit than towards it.\nHow might the introduction and increased use of automated vehicles affect public transit use and driving? Simulations that consider whether shared automated vehicles will replace public transit services have found that total vehicle travel increases moderately-to-substantially if shared-ride automated vehicles substitute for transit use: a 6-percent increase if buses are replaced, and an 89-percent increase if high-capacity transit, like urban rail, is replaced. These simulations assume existing levels of travel demand, but most transportation economists assume that the per capita demand for travel will increase with widespread adoption of fully automated vehicles. Why more vehicle travel? Some people previously unable to drive because of age or disability could now do so, others might find riding rather than driving less onerous, and so on.\nRide-hailing and mode substitution\nIn our survey, we asked ride-hailing users which transportation modes they would have used for the trips they currently make using Uber and Lyft (Figure 3). The majority of respondents said that they would have traveled by walking, biking, or public transit, or would not have made the trip at all, while nearly four in 10 (39 percent) reported that they would have traveled by car (either by driving alone, carpooling, or taking a taxi). Using data unadjusted by frequency of ride-hailing use, about half (49 percent) of ride-hailing trips were likely to have been made by walking, biking, or public transit, or not been made at all.\nFigure 3. Likely travel mode used if Uber/Lyft were not available for last trip\n\nThis new evidence of mode substitution suggests that ride-hailing is likely increasing vehicle travel in major cities, though to date by relatively small amounts. The 61 percent of Uber and Lyft trips that would have been made by walking, biking, or transit, or not been made at all are adding vehicles to the road. In addition, ride-hailing raises the concern of deadheading miles, or miles traveled without passengers, which have previously been estimated at 20 to 50 percent of ride-hailing miles. With deadheading miles included, the vehicle travel associated with a ride-hailing trip is potentially higher than if taken in a personal vehicle.\nWhile these data provide initial insights into the travel behavior changes associated with ride-hailing, they only represent a snapshot of representative data from a sample of large cities in late 2015 to early 2016. Continued research in this area is needed to help cities and transportation planners make critical policy decisions such when and where to invest in public transit infrastructure, and whether and when to price or subsidize private mobility services in order to manage travel demand.\nConclusions and policy recommendations\nGiven the rapid growth of private mobility services, it is critical to collect data on their potential impacts on travel behavior, including vehicle ownership, vehicle miles traveled, and travel mode. Further research is needed to understand how ride-hailing will influence future traffic volumes and associated emissions so that cities can effectively manage roads, vehicles, and travel. Absent these data, cities and transit agencies are in the dark when making important decisions that influence how citizens move in their regions. Accordingly, I recommend the following to ensure that the continued growth of private mobility services leads to better urban transportation.\nPricing and/or priority to improve the flow of high-occupancy vehicles\nIn the near term, policymakers need to address the additional vehicle miles that ride-hailing services contribute to cities. Given limited road infrastructure and expanding urban populations, high-occupancy vehicles need to have priority rights-of-way. Both congestion pricing (of all vehicles, including the majority, which are still personally driven) and bus priority lanes (to allow buses to bypass traffic, making transit faster and more attractive) can serve as effective measures to ensure that scarce roadway space is used effectively.\nImproving data access for cities and transportation planners\nThere is an increasing data gap between privatized mobility operators and those in the public sphere who make critical transportation planning and policy decisions. As private mobility providers continue to rapidly expand, they gather massive amounts of data about how people move in cities \u2013 data that, for the most part, are unavailable to transportation planners or policymakers. Limited data in the public sector perpetuate less-informed decision-making, which in turn can result in transportation systems that may not meet the public\u2019s needs.\nThere are two potential solutions for bridging the data gap. First, the public sector can and should mandate data-sharing for new mobility operators like Uber and Lyft that travel on public streets and roads. The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission adopted regulations requiring ride-hail companies to share detailed data on rides in New York City. Provided they are sufficiently anonymized, and that cities have put in place clear policies and infrastructure to responsibly safeguard it, this type of data is essential for informed transportation decision-making. Regulators and planners can reasonably require the data because mobility operators rely on publicly funded infrastructure.\nSecond, the public sector can invest in more frequent data-collection efforts. While research that harnesses data from ride-hailing providers themselves may shed light on the utilization, demographics, and miles traveled of these services, the more complex decisions that individuals and households make about where to live, work, and how to get around require continued data-collection efforts through representative samples of the population. Given the pace of innovation in the transportation sector, the current pace of occasional data collection and travel analysis efforts are insufficient.\nRide-hailing services have disrupted traditional transportation providers, including public transit operators. The expansion of ride-hailing has highlighted a number of opportunities for cities to harness new technologies, data, and business models that can serve a greater portion of the population more effectively. While the introduction of private mobility services has brought about welcome innovation in the transportation sector and higher levels of mobility for many travelers, better collaboration between the public sector and these private service providers are required to ensure that these services can be effectively woven into the fabric of cities in ways that are sustainable, equitable, and safe.\n\n This article is adapted from Clewlow, R.

      "Houston-area road construction tracker\nLatest updates on major projects shaping the region - including when they will begin and end.\nIt almost could be Houston scripture: The Texas Department of Transportation giveth, and the Texas Department of Transportation taketh away. However, the department is not the only one forcing drivers to dodge orange cones or buses to take a little more time to get where they are going. Numerous agencies, including Metropolitan Transit Authority and Harris County Toll Road Authority, have millions of dollars in road work underway or lined up.\nAnd while road construction is almost always happening in and around the city, some projects eventually do come to an end. For the better part of a decade, U.S. 290 was a work zone clogged with cars and trucks in narrow lanes. Now it is among the smoothest and most predictable trips in the region.\nOther places like Interstate 45 south of Houston are the bad bottlenecks today, but they will not be forever. Here\u2019s how some of the biggest projects are progressing, when they might end and what work is yet to come.\nBe sure to check regularly for updates on how these projects continue to develop.\nAdvertisement\nDone within 1 year\nWidens freeway to three lanes to the Brazos River, where widening work is already completed Read more\nThe stretch, which straddles the Houston and Yoakum districts of the Texas Department of Transportation, is part of a generation-long goal of having three lanes in each direction along I-10 from Houston to San Antonio. \nWork in Brookshire has been delayed for months as officials address right of way and flooding issues, notably around Donigan Road. \nThe Interstate 10 in Brookshire project is currently budgeted at  $148.3 million, but it was previously budgeted for $141.5 million.\nPhotos\nWithin 5 years\nWidens freeway to four or more lanes in each direction and adds or expands frontage roads Read more\nFor the last decade, work has marched south toward the coast, with TxDOT celebrating completion of the portion to FM 518 in mid-2023. That still leaves a lot of work, however, with orange cones now dominant along the stretch from Dickinson to the Texas City Wye.\nWork will open in phases, with new lanes as far south as Texas City open by late 2025 or early 2026, though it will be years later before all planned work along the freeway is finished to the island. By that time, even more could be planned. \nThe Interstate 45 at Texas City Wye to Galveston Causeway project is currently budgeted at  $515.2 million, but it was previously budgeted for $494.9 million.\nPhotos\nRebuilds tollway bridge with four lanes in each direction, over two towering side-by-side cable-supported spans Read more\nA change in design, after the initial engineering was scrutinized, has cost Harris County Toll Road Authority years of delay and as much as $350 million. That's meant for months drivers cruised right past long-completed approaches to a missing bridge. Soon, however, work on the span will be much more noticeable, with the first two of four 514-foot towers rising up the level of the current bridge.\nOnce the towers are set, work will start on the roadway itself. Eventually, all traffic will move to that new southbound tollway so the current bridge can be demolished and the new northbound span built.\nThe Ship Channel Bridge project is currently budgeted at  $975 million, but it was previously budgeted for $1.3 billion.\nPhotos\nExtends the Katy Managed Lanes along Interstate 10 from Voss into downtown Houston Read more\nPart of a broader plan to add managed lanes to many Houston freeways to improve carpool trips and capacity without solo vehicle lanes, the project \u2013 which has no money committed at this point \u2013 would add two managed lanes in each direction from Voss to Interstate 45, likely along an elevated structure down the freeway.\nOpposition has said the lanes are unnecessary, and TxDOT should stay in its existing right of way and at the same level, prioritizing transit improvements within Loop 610.\nThe Interstate 10 Managed Lanes project budget remains unchanged at  $682.4 million\nElevated lanes for bus rapid transit along Interstate 10 within Loop 610 to downtown Houston Read more\nThe busway would allow for both park and ride buses and rapid transit to avoid choked traffic along I-10 within Loop 610, making transit trips more predictable and faster.\nNeighbors have urged Metro to work with TxDOT, which is planning its own elevated managed lanes along the corridor, in the hopes of avoiding two taller roadways. Citing other work along I-10, Metro in mid-2024 said it would \"de-scope\" the plan to start as HOV lanes and add stations for rapid transit at a later date.\nThe Inner Katy BRT project is currently budgeted at  $703.7 million, but it was previously budgeted for $323 million.\nPhotos\nRebuild of four remaining ramps where Loop 610 and Texas 288 cross Read more\nThe work will eventually untie traffic at one of the most chaotic areas along Loop 610, where the freeway crosses Texas 288 and the tollway down the center. Four of the ramps were rebuilt and opened last year as part of the tollway project. The remaining four, now linked with temporary ramps, will be replaced as part of the $123.6 million project.\nThe Loop 610 at Cambridge project is currently budgeted at  $125.2 million, but it was previously budgeted for $116.9 million.\nPhotos\nFurther out\nThe largest project in Houston freeway history, it rebuilds and redesigns the downtown freeway system while adding two managed lanes in each direction along Interstate 45.

North of downtown, the project adds managed lanes from I-10 to Beltway 8 near Bush Intercontinental Airport.\nTo add all that driving capacity, however, the project would impact \u2014 the catchword for any structure or dwelling directly touched by the changing road boundary \u2014 158 houses, 433 apartments or condos, 486 public housing units, 340 businesses, five churches and two schools. \nThe loss of homes and businesses, in order to widen the freeway, has led to intense opposition to the plan that remains critical of TxDOT\u2019s efforts to start work.\nThe Interstate 45 rebuild project is currently budgeted at  $11.2 billion, but it was previously budgeted for $7.5 billion.\nPhotos\nA 25.3-mile bus rapid transit project from northeast Houston to Westchase, the centerpiece of Metro\u2019s long-range transit plan Read more\nConsidered in many ways the east-west spine of Metropolitan Transit Authority\u2019s major projects, which voters approved in 2019, the project rebuilds miles of Houston streets to add bus-only lanes and central stations where riders can get on and off large buses. The approved route would run from the Tidwell Transit Center, south along Lockwood to the University of Houston and Texas Southern University, then west mostly along Wheeler, Richmond and Westpark to the Westchase Park and Ride.\nMetro, however, has put the brakes on the project, citing the cost and other priorities. \nThe University Corridor BRT project is currently budgeted at  $2.2 billion, but it was previously budgeted for $1.5 billion.\nPhotos\nExpansion of Houston area's third ring road between League City and Alvin Read more\nRapid growth has made the segment from Interstate 45 west to Alvin a priority to accommodate housing development in Brazoria County south of Pearland. Plans call for building the tollway in the median of the Texas 35 bypass around Alvin, where for decades city leaders have envisioned a major road. \nCritics have called the road ruinous for the region\u2019s prairies and pastures -- accelerating the growth of housing subdivisions farther from the urban core -- but wherever segments of the parkway have opened, drivers have responded with even more use than anticipated. Whether that demonstrates the need for the road, or its primary role in driving outward development, remains the debate.\nThe Grand Parkway Segment B project budget remains unchanged at  $1.6 billion\nPhotos\nPrivately funded plan, but relying on government loans, for a Japanese-style high speed rail line between Houston and Dallas Read more\nControversial from the start, the latest plan for bullet trains in Texas has gotten farther than previous iterations, but is still stuck at the station. The partially federally-approved route would run mostly along a utility corridor between south of downtown Dallas to the the current site of Northwest Mall in Houston.\nThe 180-or-so miles between the metro areas, however, remains the problem. Rural landowners and the elected officials who represent them are vocally, viscerally opposed to anything coming through. They\u2019ve challenged the right of the company to use eminent domain, questioned almost every justification the company has used for building the line and all but assured planners they will sue to stop the line.\nThat, along with changing financial conditions, leave the project largely in limbo more than a decade after it was announced, despte Amtrak taking the reins and studying it as a national model for high-speed rail. \nThe Texas Bullet Train project is currently budgeted at  $28 billion, but it was previously budgeted for $12 billion.\nPhotos\nCompleted\nRebuild of ramps between the freeways and main lanes of the Loop Read more\nThe project, initially expected to cost $258.7 million and now estimated to top $272.6 million, rebuilt the main lanes of Loop 610 spanning I-69 and all of the connection ramps between the two freeways.

The event signified the start of construction in the East Downtown area and in the Midtown and Third Ward areas.\n\u201cWe are proud to be here, opening this huge benefit for the people of Houston today and for future generations,\u201d said J. Bruce Bugg, chairman of the Texas Transportation Commission. \"We\u2019re making big plays. Getting Texans moving and out of traffic faster and safer is our goal.\"\nThe I-45 project \u2014 one of the largest infrastructure projects in Texas \u2014 is designed to expand roadway capacity, reduce congestion, improve safety, and enhance mobility along I-45 from I-69 to Beltway 8. It also includes rebuilding downtown Houston\u2019s freeway system, which covers I-45, I-69, I-10, and SH 288. A key element is rerouting I-45 to run parallel with I-69 and I-10 through downtown Houston.\nThe project not only addresses current population growth but also lays a foundation for the region\u2019s sustainable development. The project targets congestion relief, improves evacuation routes, and promotes multimodal transportation options.\n\u201cThis road is about economic development\u2026You\u2019re talking about joining the two sides of downtown,\u201d said Transportation Commissioner Steven Alvis. \u201cIn addition, it will move freight and give people back time. If you can save people 20 minutes twice a day, think about what that means for them and their families.\u201d\nThe groundbreaking event had a football-themed celebration, featuring appearances by Houston legend Vince Young, NHHIP Project Manager Grady Mapes, and Texas Southern University (TSU) mascot TEX. The TSU Ocean of Soul drumline and Young Women\u2019s College Preparatory Academy (YWCPA) cheerleaders added vibrancy to the occasion.\nThe first phase, Segment 3B-1, will focus on stormwater management with the installation of 12-foot box culverts to direct stormwater to detention ponds, enhancing flood resiliency. St. Emanuel Street will serve as a feeder road for this portion of I-45. This phase, expected to be completed by 2027, has a budget of $121 million.\nFollowing this, Segment 3B-2, set to begin in January 2025 and expected to be completed by 2030, will focus on constructing new mainlanes, frontage roads, and enhanced bike and pedestrian infrastructure on I-69 between SH 288 and I-45. The estimated cost for Segment 3B-2 is $695.5 million.\nNHHIP is needed for several reasons. There is inadequate highway capacity for existing and future traffic demands on the highways in the North Houston corridor. Between the years 2015 and 2040, average daily traffic volumes are projected to increase by as much as 40% in the project corridor.\nTraffic congestion, which is measured by traffic volume and roadway capacity, will increase if no improvements are made.\nThe current high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane on I-45 serves traffic in only one direction during the peak traffic periods and is unused for large portions of the day. During peak hours, the HOV lane is congested.\nI-45 is a designated evacuation route for the region. At its present capacity, evacuation effectiveness would be limited in the event of a hurricane or other regional emergency.\nPortions of I-45 do not meet current roadway design standards, creating a traffic safety concern. Other roadway design deficiencies include inadequate storm water drainage in some locations. Intense rainfall causes high water levels at the I-45/I-10 underpass and on the outside lanes. I-45 would not operate effectively as an evacuation route with high water closures, especially during hurricane evacuations when high rainfall events are likely.\nForecasts for commuter traffic indicate that even with parallel high-capacity transit in the corridor, two-way managed lanes would be needed to support commuter traffic and express bus service. The entire I-45 NHHIP project is expected to take 18 years to complete. \n",

across more than 180 countries and territories\nMontreal, 19 September 2024 \u2013 Airports Council International (ACI) World today announces the release of its highly anticipated 2024 Annual World Airport Traffic Report, projecting 10% growth for passenger traffic in 2024 to reach 9.5 billion.\nDrawing data from over 2,700 airports across more than 180 countries and territories, the report offers the most comprehensive overview of the global airport industry and aviation markets for the operating year 2023 and the first half of 2024. It includes full rankings for passenger, cargo, and aircraft traffic.\nACI World Director General Justin Erbacci commented: \u201cThe release of the 2024 Annual World Airport Traffic Report highlights the resilience and adaptability of the global aviation industry and demonstrates ACI World\u2019s unmatched ability to predict and analyze industry trends. As we continue to navigate an increasingly complex and evolving landscape, ACI World remains committed to supporting our airport members through advocacy and the development of timely resources.\n\u201cThe insights provided in this report\u2014reaffirming ACI World\u2019s 99.99% forecasting accuracy\u2014are crucial for aviation stakeholders, policymakers, and industry professionals to make informed, data-driven decisions and strategically plan for the future.\u201d\nBi-annual air travel demand Advisory Bulletin\nIn tandem with the release of the 2024 World Airport Traffic Report, ACI World also unveils its bi-annual air traffic demand Advisory Bulletin. This trusted source for air travel demand is an essential resource for ACI members and the wider aviation system, further cementing ACI World\u2019s authority in the industry.\nHighlights:\n\n2023 global passenger traffic: Global passenger traffic reached 8.7 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 30.6% from 2022 or a recovery at 95% from pre-pandemic results (2019).\n99.99% forecasting accuracy: The ACI World Airport Traffic Forecast 2023-2052, released in February 2024, estimated global passenger traffic would reach 8.7 billion. The actual global total for 2023, confirmed in July 2024, astonishingly matched this projection with 99.99% accuracy.\n2024 global passenger traffic: Current projections estimate total passenger will reach approximately 9.5 billion, representing 104% of the 2019 level and reflecting a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth from 2023.\nH1 2024 passenger traffic: By June 2024 year-to-date (YTD), total passenger traffic increased by 11% YoY, reaching 102% of the June 2019 YTD level. The international market, driving recovery, saw a 17% YoY increase, while the domestic market grew by 6% YoY.\n2024 international passenger traffic: Expected to reach 4.1 billion by the end of 2024, accounting for 43% of total passengers.\n2024 domestic passenger traffic: Projected to reach 5.4 billion by the end of 2024, making up 57% of the total.\n\nDespite positive macroeconomic developments such as easing inflationary pressures, the medium-to-long-term outlook remains subject to downside risks such as geopolitical conflicts, labor market bottlenecks, and aircraft delivery constraints. However, the gradual recovery of international passengers and a return to profitability for airlines signal a positive momentum in the industry.\nAbout ACI\nAirports Council International (ACI), the trade association of the world\u2019s airports, is a federated organization comprising ACI World, ACI Africa, ACI Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, ACI EUROPE, ACI Latin America and the Caribbean and ACI North America.

      "Can We Build Our Way Out of Urban Traffic Congestion?\n\nExecutive Summary\nMost highways in urban areas experience some degree of congestion, which reduces mobility, imposing longer travel time for drivers. In response, many cities have chosen to expand their highway infrastructure by building additional lanes or fixed-rail transit lines. This research examines the costs of expanding highway capacity as well and how the unintended consequences of doing so may actually increase demand.\nBenefits of expansion may be limited\nBecause expanded capacity attracts more drivers, any congestion relief from expanding highway capacity may be temporary or limited:\nWhile expanding highway capacity increases total traffic volume, which does improve community well-being, it is unlikely to be an efficient solution to major highway congestion issues.\nThe potential for a tolling system\nAn alternative approach to highway expansion would be a variable tolling system:\nIn places where variable tolls have been used, they have been shown to be an efficient tool to manage traffic flows.\nIntroduction\nA transportation system provides mobility for people living in a community. It allows businesses to move goods cheaply, increasing economic activity. An efficient transportation system promotes better matches between jobs and workers, which increases labor productivity. Mobility depends on the physical capacity of the transportation infrastructure and any resulting congestion. As economic activity expands, congestion becomes a more significant factor influencing mobility.1 Robert Krol, \u201cTransportation, Mobility, and Economic Growth,\u201d InsideSources, January 19, 2017.\nHighway congestion is a costly problem in urban areas. The two most common policy approaches to reducing congestion are to expand highway capacity and to build mass-transit systems. Because both responses are expensive and have a poor track record when it comes to reducing congestion, many economists have proposed that it would be more efficient for policy makers to focus on road pricing. Variable tolls on all or some highway lanes can manage traffic flows.2Robert Krol, \u201cTolling the Freeway: Congestion Pricing and the Economics of Managing Traffic\u201d (Mercatus Research, Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Arlington, VA, 2016).\nWhat is the best approach for public officials who wish to promote or maintain high levels of mobility? The basic policy question centers on whether expanding highway capacity is the most efficient way to manage congestion. Would demand management (i.e., tolling) be a better alternative?\nAs economist Anthony Downs has pointed out, expanding highway capacity does not fully eliminate congestion.3Anthony Downs, \u201cThe Law of Peak-Hour Expressway Congestion,\u201d Traffic Quarterly 16 (1962): 393\u2013409; Anthony Downs, Stuck in Traffic: Coping with Peak-Hour Traffic Congestion (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 1992); Anthony Downs, \u201cTraffic: Why It\u2019s Getting Worse, What Governments Can Do\u201d (Policy Brief, Brookings Institution, Washington, DC, 2004). The additional highway capacity draws more vehicles to the road. In the economics literature, this behavior is known as induced travel (or induced demand), sometimes called the fundamental law of congestion.4 Gilles Duranton and Matthew A. Turner, \u201cThe Fundamental Law of Road Congestion: Evidence from U.S. Cities,\u201d American Economic Review 101, no. 6 (2011): 2616\u201352. Induced travel is a broader measure than induced demand, signifying the increase in vehicle miles traveled that results from an increase in highway capacity. Induced travel includes a wider set of behavioral responses to additional highway lanes. Most empirical studies are measuring induced travel. The difference is discussed in more detail later in the paper.\nUltimately, the issue boils down to quantity: How much travel is induced? This is an empirical question. It turns out that estimating the amount of induced travel is complicated; researchers have taken different approaches. This paper critically reviews the evidence found in the economics literature. The best-structured empirical studies find that induced travel is economically significant, reducing the congestion relief benefits from highway expansion.\nBecause highway expansion is costly, especially in urban areas, the presence of significant induced travel suggests that highway demand management using tolls may be a more efficient policy approach to reduce congestion in urban areas. This does not mean that cities should never expand highway capacity. Clearly, rapidly growing cities will require expanded highway capacity. However, one important advantage of having a tolling system in place is that driver responses to tolls send a clear signal to transportation policy makers, indicating exactly where limited funds should be spent on incremental highway construction. This information can result in a better use of limited infrastructure funds.5Robert Krol, \u201cPolitical Incentives and Transportation Funding\u201d (Mercatus Research, Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Arlington, VA, 2015).\nCongestion Trends\nCongestion is getting worse in the United States. The Texas A&M Transportation Institute quantifies congestion in terms of time delays and the dollar value of those delays.6David Schrank et al., 2015 Urban Mobility Scorecard (Texas A&M Transportation Institute and INRIX Inc., 2015). Figures 1 and 2 show the congestion trends in terms of time delays and costs between 1996 and 2014.\nTime delays have risen from 4.2 billion hours in 1996 to 6.9 billion hours in 2014. This represents a 64.3 percent increase. When the dollar values of the wasted time and fuel costs are added together, the dollar cost of congestion has risen from $93 billion in 1996 to $160 billion in 2014, a 72 percent increase. The only year-over-year decline occurred in 2009, a result of the severe recession that reduced driving. To put these numbers into practical terms, the institute\u2019s report estimates that the average urban driver needs to allow 48 minutes for a rush-hour trip that would take 20 minutes on a congestion-free highway.7In a 2012 version of the report, the authors provide data on the percentage increase in congestion over time for groups of urban areas. Their chart suggests that areas that had greater increases in road capacity experienced smaller increases in congestion. This is a misleading interpretation of the data. Without controlling for population and economic growth, it is not possible to conclude that highway expansion is the cause of the decline in congestion. The authors of the report also caution readers that other factors may have contributed to the decline in congestion. David Schrank, Bill Eisele, and Tim Lomax, 2012 Urban Mobility Report (Texas A&M Transportation Institute, 2012).\nFigure 1. Total US Congestion Time Delays, 1996\u20132014\n\nSource: David Schrank et al., 2015 Urban Mobility Scorecard (Texas A&M Transportation Institute and INRIX Inc., 2015).\nFigure 2. Total US Costs of Congestion, 1996\u20132014\n\nSource: David Schrank et al., 2015 Urban Mobility Scorecard (Texas A&M Transportation Institute and INRIX Inc., 2015).\nTable 1 provides a rough picture of the demand and supply forces that drive rising congestion. Demand factors include the growth in the adult population, in registered vehicles, and in vehicle miles traveled. Highway supply is measured in terms of highway and road lane miles. The highway statistics are for major roads, a category that includes interstate highways, freeways, and principal arterial roads.8 These roads carry high traffic volumes and represent a major percentage of trips in urban areas.\nFor the US as a whole, the adult population, number of registered vehicles, and vehicle miles traveled increased twice as fast as the number of lane miles between 1996 and 2014. In urban areas, where lane miles have expanded more than 35 percent, which is more than 20 percentage points faster than in the country as a whole, highway expansion was still unable to keep up with the 45 percent increase in vehicle miles driven. These numbers suggest that while highway capacity has grown over the past 20 years, capacity has not kept pace with expanding travel.\nTable 1.

These changes in highway capacity initially reduce the time and gasoline costs of travel.9While the focus of this paper is on the impact of highway capacity on demand and congestion, other shifts in transportation policies\u2014such as expansions of public transit or private-sector parking benefits\u2014can have similar effects. This is discussed later in the paper. As a result, we expect to observe changes in travel behavior. The addition of lanes to a congested highway increases traffic speeds, thus lowering the price (or cost) of driving. As a result, more drivers choose to use the highway. Additional drivers on the highway represent the induced travel (induced demand) from highway capacity expansion.\nThe additional vehicles come from a number of sources. As highway capacity expands, individuals take more and longer trips.10 New trips represent what is called latent travel demand. Some public-transportation users switch back to using the more flexible car as a mode of transportation. Public transit systems may reduce the frequency of trips or raise fares as ridership declines, causing even more individuals to drive. These behavioral changes represent induced demand, which includes only new vehicle miles traveled as the result of an increase in highway capacity. Drivers who have planned trips at less optimal times may shift some trips to peak hours. Individuals who traveled on less-preferred routes may shift to the expanded highway. Other long-run adjustments may include an increase in car ownership or spatial reallocation of activities, such as the replacement of central business districts with regional malls and changes in residential locations.11 Robert B. Noland, \u201cRelationships between Highway Capacity and Induced Vehicle Travel,\u201d Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice 35 (2001): 47\u201372. All of these behavioral travel adjustments together represent the broadest measure called induced travel.\nThese behavioral changes can be easily understood using a simple supply and demand framework.12 Much of this analysis draws on two sources: Noland, \u201cRelationships between Highway Capacity and Induced Vehicle Travel\u201d; and Robert B. Noland and Lewison L. Lem, \u201cA Review of the Evidence for Induced Travel and Changes in Transportation and Environmental Policy in the U.S. and U.K.,\u201d Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment 7 (2002): 1\u201326. Figure 3 illustrates the induced travel effect on a congested highway when capacity expands.\nFigure 3. Induced Travel Effect of a Highway Expansion\n\nThe vertical axis measures the price or cost of travel (P). This includes fuel costs, wear and tear on the vehicle, and the value of the commuter\u2019s time. Variation in the time cost of travel is the key factor in this analysis. As congestion increases and highway speeds slow, travel time for the same trip increases. Because time has value in terms of forgone wages and leisure, the time cost of the trip increases as the travel time increases. The horizontal axis measures the quantity of travel (Q), measured in vehicle miles traveled.\nThe analysis includes a supply curve (S) that reflects the private cost of using the highway.13 The supply curve represents the private average cost of using the highway, or the cost per vehicle. The cost increases with vehicle miles traveled because speeds slow and hence travel time increases. Private costs are also a function of, or are conditional on, highway capacity. For uncongested highways, the supply curve would be flat to reflect constant travel costs. Also, when the highway is at capacity with total gridlock, the supply curve would be vertical. This analysis focuses on congested highways that have positive average speeds. This analysis does not include the external costs. See Noland, \u201cRelationships between Highway Capacity and Induced Vehicle Travel\u201d; Noland and Lem, \u201cReview of the Evidence for Induced Travel\u201d; Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion\u201d; Jan K. Brueckner, Lectures on Urban Economics (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2011), chap. 5. Changes in highway capacity cause the supply curve to shift. In this example, the increase in highway capacity lowers the travel cost, causing the supply curve to shift to the right. Also included are short-run and long-run demand curves (DSR and DLR).14Here\u2019s a brief explanation of the demand curve, as it applies to driving: Drivers choose between using the highway and using alternate travel routes and modes. If an individual chooses the highway, that means it is the low-cost route for that individual. In other words, it is cheaper than the alternate route. The demand curves measure drivers\u2019 willingness to pay for using the highway. The most they are willing to pay for using the highway is an amount that equals the cost of using the alternate route. The cost of the alternate route or mode will vary by individual, depending on the individual\u2019s spatial location. At the equilibrium level of vehicle miles traveled, willingness to pay represented by the height of the demand curve equals private average cost represented by the height of the supply curve. See Kenneth A. Small and Erik T. Verhoef, The Economics of Urban Transportation (New York: Routledge, 2007); Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion\u201d; Brueckner, Lectures on Urban Economics. Economic growth and demographic trends can cause the demand curve to shift. We initially hold these other factors constant, which determines the location of the demand curve. The long-run demand curve is shown to be relatively more price elastic (i.e., the long-run demand curve shows a greater response to price changes than the short-run demand curve), because the behavioral adjustments from a price change should be larger over time (in the long run), as drivers have more time to adjust. For example, highway expansion can cause people to change where they live, causing an increase in traffic volume over time (in the long run).\nPrice P1 and quantity Q1 represent the initial congested highway\u2019s equilibrium. When highway capacity is expanded, the supply curve shifts from S1 to S2 , lowering the cost of using the highway. This results in a new short-run equilibrium at price P2 and quantity Q2 . The change in quantity demanded from Q1 to Q2 represents the short-run induced travel (induced demand) from highway expansion. The behavioral adjustment of travelers resulting from the lower travel cost is larger in the long run. This can be observed by examining the adjustment along the long-run demand curve. In this case, the induced long-run quantity demanded equals the change from Q1 to Q3.15As will be discussed later, the empirical research finds larger changes in the long-run than in the short-run adjustment. Because the traffic volume is larger and speeds are lower as time passes and people have time to adjust, the price of traveling on the highway is higher at the new long-run equilibrium (P3) than at the new short-run equilibrium (P2).\nThe previous analysis held economic growth, population growth, and other demographic factors constant. When these factors change, the demand curve shifts. When researchers estimate the induced travel associated with highway expansion, they must control for these factors that impact traffic volume independently of road expansion. This is illustrated in figure 4.\nFigure 4. Highway Expansion Accompanied by Economic Growth\n\nFigure 4 is much like figure 3, except that the analysis only uses a long-run demand curve. The initial equilibrium is at price P1, quantity Q1 . The figure also shows the long-run equilibrium price P3 and quantity Q3 from figure 3. The same highway capacity expansion is captured by shifting the supply curve from S1 to S2 , as in figure 3. However, in this case, simultaneous economic growth causes the demand curve to shift from DLR, 1 to DLR, 2. The long-run equilibrium occurs at price P4 and quantity Q4 . While the total change in vehicle miles traveled on the highway equals Q4 minus Q1 , the induced quantity demanded from highway capacity expansion equals the smaller quantity Q3 minus Q1 . The difference Q4 minus Q3 represents the additional vehicle miles traveled on the highway owing to economic growth. Researchers must control for the growth in demand factors that increases vehicle miles traveled on a highway, or they will overstate the size of the induced quantity demanded.\nEmpirical Issues and Evidence\nIssues\nEconomists and transportation analysts have tried to estimate the magnitude of induced travel (induced demand) that results from a highway expansion. In a nutshell, they want to estimate the elasticity of vehicle miles traveled with respect to greater highway capacity (i.e., the percent change in vehicle miles traveled divided by the percent change in lane miles). Does it approximately equal one, or is it significantly less than one? If the elasticity equals one, expanding capacity does little to reduce congestion because for every 1 percent increase in lane miles, there is a 1 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled. If the elasticity is less than one, for every 1 percent increase in lane miles, there is less than a 1 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled. In this case, expanding highway capacity would lower congestion.\nIn the research literature, the standard empirical model used to estimate the elasticity of vehicle miles traveled with respect to lane miles regresses vehicle miles traveled on lane miles. In addition, control variables that measure demographic factors and economic activity that can influence vehicle miles traveled are also included in the model.16All variables are in logarithmic form, so estimated coefficients can be interpreted as an elasticity\nIncluding either lagged vehicle miles traveled or lane miles in the regression analysis enables the model to better capture longer-run dynamic adjustments. It is reasonable to assume that the behavioral adjustment that results from expanding the highway does not occur quickly; including lagged behavioral variables captures the gradual adjustment of driving behavior and land-use patterns.\nThere are a number of issues that make estimating the induced travel (induced demand) effect difficult. The omission of important variables that influence vehicle miles traveled causes an \u201comitted variable bias\u201d that results in a biased elasticity estimate.17 When the omitted variable that influences vehicle miles traveled is correlated with other explanatory variables in the regression, the estimated impact coefficient of the explanatory variable will be biased. In order to address this problem, researchers expand the data used in the analysis by incorporating more explanatory control variables. The most reliable studies use panel data in the empirical analysis. Panel data include observations across highways, cities, or states (observational units) over a period of years. In contrast, cross-sectional studies examine data across highways, cities, or states only at a point in time.\nPanel data have a number of advantages. The increased number of observations allows the researcher to include more control variables and still get precise estimates of key parameters. Since not all factors that influence vehicle miles traveled are observable, when these variables differ across observational units but not over time, panel data estimates can include what are called \u201cfixed effects.\u201d18 See James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson, Introduction to Econometrics (Boston: Addison-Wesley, 2015); Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data (Boston: MIT Press, 2010). For example, the geographic terrain can vary between observational units but not change over time. Fixed effects are indicator variables (dummy variables) that take on the value one for a particular observational unit, but equal zero for other observational units.19 These dummy variables effectively adjust the regression intercept term for fixed unobserved differences between observational units. Panel data models can also adjust for \u201ctime effects.\u201d If an unobserved variable differs over time but not across observational units, say the business cycle, a dummy variable for each time period is included in the model.\nThe direction of causality is another issue. In the case of estimating induced travel from highway expansion, does population growth and an increase in vehicle miles traveled drive the need to increase capacity, or does increasing capacity causes greater vehicle miles traveled? When this question is not addressed, standard econometric estimation methods (ordinary least squares) provide biased results.\nAn instrumental-variable estimation technique can be used to handle this problem. This involves a twostage estimation process. When highway capacity is influenced by vehicle miles traveled, the researcher must find variables (instrumental variables) that are correlated with highway capacity, but do not affect vehicle miles traveled. For example, as one of its instrumental variables for actual urban interstate lane kilometers, one study used metropolitan statistical area (MSA) highway kilometers from the 1947 interstate highway plan. These are highly correlated with actual urban interstate highways built, but are not affected by current vehicle miles traveled.20 Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion.\u201d Highway capacity is then regressed on the instrumental variable or variables. The predicted value from this regression for highway capacity, instead of actual highway capacity, is used to estimate the impact of highway capacity on vehicle miles traveled. This method provides statistically consistent results.21 See Stock and Watson, Introduction to Econometrics, chap. 10. However, without good instruments, using an instrumental variables technique can produce more biased estimates. Good instruments\u2014variables that result in a high correlation with the actual variables\u2014allow for more meaningful hypothesis testing.22 John Bound, David A. Jaeger, and Regina M. Baker, \u201cProblems with Instrumental Variables Estimation When the Correlation between the Instruments and the Endogenous Explanatory Variables Is Weak,\u201d Journal of the American Statistical Association 90 (1995): 443\u201350; Isaiah Andrews, James Stock, and Liyang Sun, \u201cWeak Instruments in IV Regression: Theory and Practice\u201d (unpublished manuscript, August 2, 2018), PDF file.\nFinally, as more time passes following a highway expansion, the behavioral adjustment tends to be larger. As a result, the estimated short-run elasticity of vehicle miles traveled with respect to the number of lane miles is likely to be smaller than the long-run elasticity. This can be taken into account by including lagged values of vehicle miles traveled in the regression.23 See William H. Greene, Econometric Analysis, 2nd ed. (New York: Macmillan, 1993), chap. 18\nEvidence \nThis section includes results from key studies that have empirically examined the relationship between highway capacity and vehicle miles traveled. Only panel data studies are included, because they provide more reliable results.\nThe size of the estimated induced travel varies across studies. This variation occurs because there is significant variation among studies in model specification and data used. Studies use alternative estimation methods, including standard ordinary least squares, fixed effects, and instrumental variables. The control variables and instrumental variables vary among studies. Table 2 summarizes the results of the panel data studies.24 This review focuses on the papers that best handle the econometric problems in this research area.\nTable 2. Summary of Key Elasticity Estimates25Note: MSA = metropolitan statistical area. VMT = vehicle miles traveled. a Exact years vary by state. Years 1985\u201395 include all states; Maryland spans 1969\u201396, North Carolina 1985\u201397, Virginia 1970\u201396, and DC 1970\u201396. b Total road lane miles and vehicle miles traveled are broken down among interstate, arterial, and collector roads. c An important difference in this paper is that the author estimates the models using disaggregated data simultaneously using the seemingly unrelated regression method. This approach assumes that the error terms from each type of road classification regression are correlated. This results in a more precise estimate. See William H.

First, there is clear evidence that expanding highway capacity results in greater vehicle miles traveled (induced travel). The estimated elasticity of vehicle miles traveled with respect to highway capacity is positive and significant. Some of the estimates suggest it does not differ significantly from one, which would mean that adding capacity does not reduce congestion. There is also evidence that higher vehicle miles traveled result in increases in lane miles, an example of reverse causality.27 Robert Cervero and Mark Hansen found that the elasticity of lane miles with respect to vehicle miles traveled was between .33 and .79. Robert Cervero and Mark Hansen, \u201cInduced Travel Demand and Induced Road Investment: A Simultaneous Equation Analysis,\u201d Journal of Transport Economics and Policy 36, no. 3 (2002): 469\u201390. This result illustrates why using instrumental variables estimation is important in getting meaningful empirical results.\nAdding lanes to congested highways is unlikely to dramatically reduce congestion. Highway traffic volume will increase, which does provide benefits to residents using the highway, but congestion will likely remain. This conclusion follows from the fact that many of the long-run estimates of the elasticity of vehicle miles traveled with respect to lane miles are close to one.28Mark Hansen and Yuanlin Huang, \u201cRoad Supply and Traffic in California Urban Areas,\u201d Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice 31, no. 3 (1997): 205\u201318; Robert B. Noland and William A. Cowart, \u201cAnalysis of Metropolitan Highway Capacity and the Growth in Vehicle Miles of Travel,\u201d Transportation 27, no. 4 (2000): 363\u201390; Noland, \u201cRelationships between Highway Capacity and Induced Vehicle Travel\u201d; Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion\u201d; Wen-Tai Hsu and Hongliang Zhang, \u201cThe Fundamental Law of Highway Congestion Revisited: Evidence from National Expressways in Japan,\u201d Journal of Urban Economics 81 (2014): 65\u201376. However, an elasticity value of one is not a universal result from the research literature.\nSecond, there is a wide range of estimates on the size of induced travel. This is the case because researchers use different units of observation, study different geographic areas or particular highways, examine different time periods, employ different model specifications (control variables), and adopt different estimation methods.\nDifferences in the unit of observation can be important. For example, when state data are used, some behavioral changes, such as drivers switching to an expanded road, do not show up in the data. The increase in vehicle miles traveled on the expanded highway is offset or \u201cnetted out\u201d by the decline in vehicle miles traveled on a previous route driven. In this setting, increases in vehicle miles traveled reflect only induced demand, from new or longer trips. We would expect the size of the elasticity of vehicle miles traveled with respect to increased lane miles to understate the actual response. Alternatively, studies that examine specific highways capture the broader measure of induced travel, which also includes drivers shifting routes and changes in the timing of trips. The magnitude of the response would be expected to be larger in this case.29Robert Cervero, \u201cRoad Expansion, Urban Growth, and Induced Travel,\u201d Journal of the American Planning Association 69, no. 2 (2003): 145\u2013 63; Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion\u201d; Hsu and Zhang, \u201cFundamental Law of Highway Congestion Revisited.\u201d\nThird, as one would expect, the long-run increase in vehicle miles traveled as a result of greater highway capacity is larger than the short-run adjustment.30This conclusion is consistent with Phil B. Goodwin\u2019s synthesis of the earlier literature on induced travel. Goodwin concluded that the elasticity of traffic volume with respect to travel time was about \u2212.5 in the short run and up to \u22121.0 in the long run. Phil B. Goodwin, \u201cEmpirical Evidence on Induced Demand: A Review and Synthesis,\u201d Transportation 23, no. 1 (1996): 35\u201354. This result is not surprising because, as more time passes, behavioral adjustments are greater. People relocate and land-use patterns change as a result of highway expansion.31Hansen and Huang, \u201cRoad Supply and Traffic in California Urban Areas\u201d; Noland and Cowart, \u201cAnalysis of Metropolitan Highway Capacity\u201d; Noland, \u201cRelationships between Highway Capacity and Induced Vehicle Travel\u201d; Cervero, \u201cRoad Expansion, Urban Growth, and Induced Travel.\u201d\nFourth, most of the studies use the expansion of lane miles as the force that lowers the cost of traveling on a highway. If expanding capacity on a highway with little congestion does not lower driving costs, the estimates of the impact of highway construction on congestion will be small and of little value. One study uses the increase in average recorded travel speeds to measure the cost of driving on a highway\u2014a better measure than lane capacity.32Cervero, \u201cRoad Expansion, Urban Growth, and Induced Travel.\u201d In this case, the elasticity measures the percent change in vehicle miles traveled in response to a percent change in average highway speed.\nThe 2003, 2011, and 2014 studies provide the strongest results.33 Cervero, \u201cRoad Expansion, Urban Growth, and Induced Travel\u201d; Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion\u201d; Hsu and Zhang, \u201cFundamental Law of Highway Congestion Revisited.\u201d But each has drawbacks. The advantage of Robert Cervero\u2019s 2003 paper is that he uses highway speed, rather than lane miles, in his analysis. As I pointed out earlier, additional lane miles on uncongested highways will not result in faster speeds and quicker trips. This implies that lane miles may not always cause travel costs to decline. However, Cervero does not report statistics about the quality of the instrumental variables used in his study. So it is unclear whether his estimates satisfactorily resolve the simultaneous relationship between vehicle miles traveled and highway capacity.\nBoth the 2011 study by Gilles Duranton and Matthew A. Turner and the 2014 study by Wen-Tai Hsu and Hongliang Zhang use highway lane kilometers rather than speed. However, since their focus is on congested urban areas where adding lanes will surely reduce congestion initially, this should not have much of an impact on their results. But, since they use total vehicle kilometers traveled as the dependent variable, it becomes more difficult to identify the source of the increase traffic volume, new trips versus changes in the timing of trips, resulting from highway expansion.\nDuranton and Turner\u2019s paper is worth looking at in greater detail. The authors analyzed a large sample of 228 interstates and highways located in urban MSAs over time.34 The years were 1983, 1993, and 2003. Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion.\u201d They used planned interstate highway kilometers from the 1947 highway plan, MSA railroad route kilometers from 1898, and the routes taken by explorers during the first half of the 19th century as their instrumental variables for actual lane kilometers. All three of these variables are highly correlated with the actual routes of interstate highways built, but are not closely related to current vehicle miles traveled, controlling for population.35Duranton and Turner report test statistics showing that these instrumental variables have high explanatory power over lane miles. This is one of the few studies that reports test statistics. Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion.\u201d A possible drawback of using these instrumental variables is that they are better predictors of the initial building of the interstate highways than of the later addition of lanes. This is a weakness in Duranton and Turner\u2019s analysis. Still, the high predictive content from these variables suggests that this is not a serious problem.\nDuranton and Turner found the elasticity of vehicle miles traveled with respect to lane kilometers to be around one. In other words, congestion returned because of induced travel (induced demand). Many of their elasticity estimates did not differ significantly from one. These results are higher than the results reported in much of the previous literature on this topic.\nInterestingly, Duranton and Turner found that public transit, as measured by major heavily used bus routes, does not impact the results. They also found that expanding highways results in a large increase in long-haul truck traffic. Their estimates show that expanding lanes increases individual driving and population. They found little evidence that traffic is being diverted from other roads. For example, they found that a 10 percent increase in urban interstate highway capacity results in a decline of about 0.5 percent in vehicle kilometers traveled on major urban roads. This suggests that, while there is some substitution between alternative roads, the magnitude is modest.36Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion.\u201d\nHsu and Zhang produce an analysis similar to that of Duranton and Turner of induced travel for Japan. Following Duranton and Turner, Hsu and Zhang use planned highways taken from the 1987 highway report for Japan as instrumental variables for lane kilometers for major highways in Japan. Once again, these plans are highly correlated with actual highway expansion but are not affected by current vehicle miles traveled in Japan. They find elasticity estimates greater than one. This suggests what the authors call a coverage effect. The coverage effect refers to a situation where additional or longer highways expand the areas serviced by the road, causing a more-than-proportional increase in trips. Hsu and Zhang find this to be the case in Japan.37Hsu and Zhang, \u201cFundamental Law of Highway Congestion Revisited.\u201d\nOther Policy Options\nGiven the findings of the empirical literature, that highway expansion induces travel, one has to conclude that adding new lanes to highways will not necessarily provide the desired relief in terms of congestion. Other than Cervero\u2019s short-run estimate, the literature suggests that induced travel is fairly large, more than .6 or .7.\nTo answer the question posed in the title of this paper, it is difficult to build sufficient infrastructure in dense urban areas so as to significantly reduce congestion. This does not mean that growing urban areas do not benefit from expanding highway capacity\u2014but this capacity is unlikely to solve serious congestion problems in the long run. It is worth examining other policies that can be directed at reducing urban congestion.\nExpanding Fixed-Rail Public Transit\nFixed-rail public transit is not a substitute for highway construction, nor does it show potential for reducing congestion except in the most densely populated communities. Mass transit is very costly, so it only makes sense if it will be heavily used.38 Rhiannon Jerch, Matthew E. Kahn, and Shanjun Li, \u201cThe Efficiency of Local Government: The Role of Privatization and Public Sector Unions,\u201d Journal of Public Economics 154 (2017): 95\u2013121. The costs of mass transit can be justified in densely populated cities where the majority of jobs (and shopping outlets) are concentrated in or near a central business district. This is a reasonable description of New York, but cities that grew in the post\u2013World War II automobile era are not dense enough. In these communities, jobs, shopping, and residences are decentralized, making fixed rail ineffective as a predominant transportation mode.39 In newer, decentralized cities, buses are a less expensive and more flexible means of providing public transit. Randal O\u2019Toole, Gridlock: Why We\u2019re Stuck in Traffic and What to Do about It (Washington, DC: Cato Institute, 2009); Randal O\u2019Toole, \u201cThe Coming Transit Apocalypse\u201d (Policy Analysis #824, Cato Institute, Washington, DC, 2017). Additional expansion of fixed-rail systems would only be successful if, at the same time, incentives were established to return business to the inner city. Flat or declining ridership trends indicate that commuters do not find public transit to be an attractive option.40 O\u2019Toole, Gridlock; O\u2019Toole, \u201cComing Transit Apocalypse.\u201d\nFurthermore, expanding fixed-rail transit is likely to suffer an induced travel problem similar to that of added highway capacity. If expanding fixed-rail transit initially resulted in a shift of commuters from cars to rail, highway congestion would decline and highway speeds increase, reducing the cost of driving. This reduction in driving costs would, over time, attract more drivers, as in the case of highway construction, eliminating some of the gains associated with the initial reduction in congestion. How big these travel adjustments would be depends on the community, its residents, and the substitutability of one means of commuting for another. The evidence on the impact of fixed-rail expansion on highway congestion is inconclusive. One problem is that researchers often fail to control for other factors that influence travel choices. Researchers have not quantified the long-run compared to the short-run impact of fixed-rail expansion on congestion.41 For a discussion of the evidence, see Molly D. Castelazo and Thomas A. Garrett, \u201cLight Rail: Boom or Boondoggle?,\u201d Regional Economist (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis), July 2004; Nathaniel Baum-Snow and Matthew E. Kahn, \u201cEffects of Urban Rail Transit Expansions: Evidence from Sixteen Cities, 1970\u20132000,\u201d Brookings-Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs, 2005, 147\u2013206; Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion\u201d; Todd Litman, \u201cCritique of \u2018Transit Utilization and Traffic Congestion: Is There a Connection?,\u2019\u201d Victoria Transport Policy Institute, 2014. Nathaniel Baum-Snow and Matthew E. Kahn find that most of the mode-of-travel changes are between buses and rail, not cars and rail. This would weaken the congestion relief effects of public transit.\nThe basic question concerning fixed-rail public transit is whether the benefits of rail (reduced congestion and pollution) outweigh construction and maintenance costs. In their 2007 study, Clifford Winston and Vikram Maheshri examined 25 transit systems in the US. They calculated the net benefits of these systems, including any reductions in congestion.42 They do not take into account environmental effects. Clifford Winston and Vikram Maheshri, \u201cOn the Social Desirability of Urban Rail Transit Systems,\u201d Journal of Urban Economics 62, no. 3 (2007): 362\u201382. For the year 2000, they estimated that costs outweighed benefits in all cases except that of the BART system in San Francisco. They conclude that, in general, transit systems do not raise social welfare owing to their high operating and capital costs and low ridership.43Winston and Maheshri, \u201cOn the Social Desirability of Urban Rail Transit Systems.\u201d Christopher Severen finds this to be the case for Los Angeles using more recent data. Christopher Severen, \u201cCommuting, Labor, and Housing Market Effects of Mass Transportation: Welfare and Identification\u201d (Working Paper 18-14, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 2018). Molly D. Castelazo and Thomas A. Garrett draw the same conclusion for St. Louis. Castelazo and Garrett, \u201cLight Rail.\u201d\nCongestion Pricing\nIf expanding highway capacity and building fixed-rail transit systems are weak options for solving urban congestion problems, what is the alternative? Most economists point out that the fundamental cause of highway congestion or overuse is that we price highways incorrectly. Most US highways are toll free.44 There are some toll roads in the U.S. Some of these roads are private and in other situations they are tolled individual lanes that parallel tollfree highway lanes. This leads to overuse and congestion.\nOn a congested highway, each additional driver causes the average speed to decline, resulting in longer travel times. In effect, additional drivers impose a cost (an externality) on other drivers using the highway. The solution is to charge a toll equal to this external cost. In this case, tolls would be highest during peak rush-hour travel times and low during off-peak times. The high tolls during rush hours would create an incentive for some drivers, those with the most flexibility, to shift trip times away from peak hours, use alternate routes, carpool, or use existing public transit. This would lead to fewer cars on the highway and less congestion.45 Krol, \u201cTolling the Freeway.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take a large reduction in congestion to increase the traffic flow.\nThis pricing strategy is a common solution to peak demand problems in other industries. For example, airline ticket prices are higher during peak holiday travel times. It would not make economic sense for airlines to keep ticket prices constant and invest in more airplanes that would be idle much of the year.\nDuring peak driving times, optimal tolls should be high enough to at least cover the marginal cost of using the highway. This includes the maintenance cost for the highway, plus pollution and congestion costs. During off-peak times, tolls should reflect only maintenance, construction, and pollution costs. Although it is not easy to quantify pollution and congestion costs, cities that have used variable tolls have had success in setting tolls that alleviate major congestion and gain popularity with drivers.\nTolls are politically unpopular. Voters see them as yet another tax. But tolls are one of the very few efficient taxes, because they don\u2019t distort the relative prices of goods and they discourage the congestion externality.46 Krol, \u201cTolling the Freeway.\u201d To increase political support for tolls, politicians might offer them as a replacement for fuel taxes.\nA key, often unrecognized, benefit of tolling is that it produces information about which routes drivers value the most, identifying areas where additional highway investment would actually make economic (rather than political) sense. For example, evidence that rush-hour tolls must dramatically rise to control congestion on a highway segment is a signal that the drivers paying the tolls place a high value on the benefits of using the route. Given limited highway funding, expanding these highways would increase driver welfare the most. Tolling congested highways results in a more efficient use of limited highway space. In addition, with variable tolling in place, we might find out that we do not need to expand the transportation system as much as we thought. This would free limited tax revenue for other uses or allow reductions in other taxes.47 For further details about this topic, see Krol, \u201cTolling the Freeway.\u201d\nCompared to the traditional approach\u2014adding highways and public transit\u2014tolling highways is an efficient way to manage local infrastructure. States may toll new interstate highways or new lanes added to existing interstates, but federal law prohibits tolling on existing interstates. The federal government could encourage efficient infrastructure investment by eliminating any remaining federal restrictions on interstate tolls. Expanding tolling is a smart policy solution.48 Duranton and Turner note that expanding highway capacity and public transit capacity are ineffective policies for reducing congestion. They suggest using some form of tolling to reduce congestion. Duranton and Turner, \u201cFundamental Law of Road Congestion.\u201d Educating voters and opening the interstates to tolling are the first steps.\nConclusions\nMost highways in urban areas experience some degree of congestion, which reduces mobility, imposing substantial costs on drivers. Furthermore, data indicate that urban congestion is getting worse. In response, many cities have chosen to expand their highway infrastructure by building additional lanes (or fixed-rail transit lines). This is very expensive. Furthermore, expanded capacity attracts more drivers, making any congestion relief temporary or limited. This paper outlines the economics that spur this behavior\u2014what economists call induced travel or induced demand\u2014and reviews evidence about its magnitude.\nWhen congested highways are expanded, driving speeds increase, at least temporarily, lowering the cost (time savings) to drivers using the highway. This lower cost results in changes in the behavior of commuters around the previously congested highway. Drivers take more trips. Some commuters who have been using alternate, less desirable, routes or public transit switch to the faster expanded highway. As a result, all or most of the congestion returns.\nInduced travel is measured by estimating the elasticity of vehicle miles traveled with respect to lane miles. There is a wide range of estimates for this elasticity. Most estimates indicate a value significantly greater than zero. Some studies find that the value of the induced travel elasticity does not differ significantly from one. These results indicate that induced travel takes on an economically meaningful magnitude. While expanding highway capacity increases total traffic volume, which raises community welfare, it is unlikely to be an efficient solution to major highway congestion issues. One potential policy alternative would be to repeal or reduce fuel taxes and replace the lost revenues with a variable tolling system.\nContact\n"

These are the Smart Streetlight cameras and Automated License Plate Recognition technologies, and nearly every day brings new installations.\nPolice say they have already assisted in solving crimes and Mayor Gloria has already gloated that the so-called smart streetlights are \u201calready making our city safer, with examples just in the first two months of operating that show their ability to help police locate and apprehend dangerous suspects more efficiently and with greater certainty.\u201d\nHe pledged: \u201cWith the level of transparency and accountability for the use of the technologies we have in place, we\u2019re enhancing San Diegans\u2019 safety while protecting their right to privacy.\u201d\nInstallation of all 500 cameras is anticipated by June, weather and other infrastructure issues permitting. It\u2019s unclear how the new city budget restrictions enacted by Gloria just recently will affect the rate of installation.\nSan Diego Patch published an account on the installation of the 500 cameras from oft-cited City News Service on February 26, some of which we repost below. But a comment here is necessary, because the Patch \u2013 CNS report is simply a shameless account of the establishment line on the cameras. Why do we claim this? Let me count the ways:\nNow that you\u2019ve been forewarned, dear reader, here\u2019s the \u201cofficial\u201d line (in other words City News Service and then Patch simply cut and pasted together a story only using the police\u2019s and mayor\u2019s positions along with the tech owners\u2019 on the cameras without any reflection, no space for \u201cthe other side\u201d and no self-criticism \u2014 which is the difference between progressive citizen journalism and corporate journalism). Proceed with caution:\nSDPD\u2019s five-year agreement with Ubicquia Inc. and Flock Safety\u2019s ALPR technology, included the installation and maintenance of an initial 500 locations citywide. Since late December, more than 100 of the 500 cameras have been installed, with new installations occurring almost daily, according to SDPD\u2019s Ashley Nicholes.\n\u201cThe San Diego Police Department already produces clearance rates for solving crimes above the national average,\u201d SDPD Chief David Nisleit said. \u201cInstead of casting a large net based on sometimes vague descriptions, the Smart Streetlight cameras and ALPR system now allow officers to be laser-focused on who committed the crime. This investment is precision, intelligence-led policing at its finest and will deliver results.\u201d\nThe cameras and ALPR can only operate in conjunction with an LED streetlight. If an LED streetlight is already in place, the technology can be easily connected to the streetlight without modification. If a designated location is not LED-equipped, SDPD works with the city\u2019s Transportation Department to replace it with an LED light, Nicholes said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re honored to partner with the City of San Diego and Ubicquia on this groundbreaking deployment of public safety technology,\u201d said Garrett Langley, CEO and Founder of Flock Safety. \u201cEvery city is different, but all need public safety solutions that align with the character and citizens of their community. This new method of positioning LPR and video security technology through the UbiHub streetlight technology shows that Flock Safety is committed to constant innovation to serve every community.\u201d\nOnce the cameras are installed, SDPD\u2019s Special Projects and Legislative Affairs Unit individually reviews each camera\u2019s viewpoint to digitally mask private property, so it is not recorded by the cameras before they are fully operational, Nicholes said. SDPD is working to provide training opportunities to officers and investigators to ensure they understand the responsibilities of access to the system.\nSafeguards for the system include:\nSDPD has taken steps to better inform the public about the new technologies, including publishing use policies and other related materials in accordance with the Transparent and Responsible Use of Surveillance Technology Ordinance to its technology website; creating a searchable map of locations of the streetlight and ALPR cameras; and collaborating with Flock Safety to create a \u201ctransparency portal\u201d on the ALPR data being collected.\nSince early January, Smart Streetlight and ALPR information has assisted SDPD officers and investigators with more than 22 homicide, robbery, burglary, assault and stolen vehicle investigations, Nicholes said. Twelve stolen vehicles have been recovered, with 11 suspects in custody from these investigations. SDPD has accessed critical information using the Smart Streetlight and Flock ALPR system to assist with four homicides, Nicholes said.\nShare this:\n{ 12 comments\u2026 read them below or add one }\nPublic safety in public places. If you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. \nFirst, there is no mention of how the 500 cameras will be disproportionately spread across San Diego neighborhoods, with most installed in African-American and Latino communities.\nThat\u2019s a pretty brazen insinuation for a journalistic statement. Based on crimes reported within police , I could see where more cameras would be placed than others. The view of more cameras in minority neighborhoods being disproportionate is odd. If there was statistically more crime in an area, wouldn\u2019t you think law abiding citizens in any neighborhood would be thankful for making things safer, instead of the knee jerk reaction of disproportional invasion of privacy and civil rights in public places?\nReply\nCS \u2013 you\u2019ve just shown that you are more of a George Orwell believer than I thought.

      "How Do Smart Traffic Lights Work? Technical Architecture and Use Cases Explained\nWhy are roads still governed by old three-color traffic lights in the age of connected infrastructure? \nIn 1912, Lester Wire, a young police officer in Salt Lake City, came up with an idea. What if there was a tool to regulate cars at intersections instead of patrol officers, who needed to spend hours rooted to a platform through rain, heat, and hail?\nWire came up with a wooden box on a pole. It had two light bulbs inside, colored red and green. The box was connected to electricity so the light bulbs could be switched from one to the other with the press of a button. That\u2019s something patrol officers could do from a booth at the side of the road.\nSince then, traffic light signals have evolved a bit. We now have yellow and don\u2019t need a patrol officer to press a button. But the original concept has remained largely the same \u2014 traffic lights change on a pre-programmed schedule.\nHowever, the state of our roads in the twenty-first century is much different than it was 100 years ago. We have more cars, bigger road networks, higher population densities, and constant traffic disruptions.\nPerhaps it\u2019s time to rethink the old and introduce a smarter traffic light system.\nWhat is a smart traffic light?\nA smart traffic light is an internet-connected vehicle traffic control system capable of adapting traffic light controls based on information collected from sensors, edge devices, and video systems.\nAt the intersection, smart traffic lights look the same as regular traffic lights except for extra hardware elements such as IoT sensors and/or connected CCTV cameras. On the back end, smart traffic light systems are connected to a cloud-based traffic management platform. They are often powered by predictive algorithms for dynamically adjusting traffic signals.\nA quick disclaimer before we go any further: A smart traffic light system can\u2019t miraculously fix all road issues, such as congestion, accidents, and rule violations. But they are a better preventive measure than traditional traffic lights.\nAs Dan Saffer, an author and the Creative Director at Smart Design, says:\nTraffic lights are only a mechanical prop, a signifier of a social contract we\u2019ve agreed to (and have written into law).\nApart from a potential fine (and good conscience), nothing stops people from red-light running (RLR) on empty intersections \u2014 and drivers do that a lot. In New York City, more red-light violations were recorded in 2021 than in any year since 2014. Accident rates also went up, which is problematic.\nWhy do people violate traffic signal rules?\nScientists agree that violations are highly contextual. The exact reasons vary, but they often fall into one of these categories:\nSmart traffic light systems cannot fully discourage people from breaking traffic rules, but they can make it less tempting.\nWith adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC), you can program dynamic rules for signal changes based on conditions and better detect RLR at busy intersections. Smart traffic signs can also adjust recommended speed limits based on the weather or road conditions to improve traffic throughput. Intelligent traffic lights, in turn, can adjust signal timing based on the volume of vehicles at different intersections and variable factors such as the time of day. Such a setup can ensure smooth traffic flows and reduce the number of situations when breaking traffic rules seems appealing (or undetectable).\nFor city managers, intelligent new traffic lights are a much-needed alternative to manual or rule-based signal controls.\nMany cities operate traffic management centers that are hives of activity akin to a busy urban air traffic control operation. But appearances are somewhat deceiving, given that the traffic engineers have limited tools available to manipulate their signal networks to respond in real-time.\nUrban traffic managers can (and should) integrate smart signaling into an intelligent transportation system. Merging the two enables users to exercise algorithmic, context-driven control over the city\u2019s transport grid through one interface. The best part? Digital traffic signals can be dynamically adjusted in real time across the entire network to:\nThat\u2019s some blissful city to live in, right?\nSadly, only a fraction of new traffic signals today are smart. Traffic light hardware can last for up to 30 years if well-maintained. But among new traffic signals, few are (or can be) connected to cameras, radar systems, or sensors. And those that do have basic sensing capabilities often can\u2019t detect cyclists or pedestrians.\nFortunately, this is changing. Urban planners \u2014 and the general public \u2014 realize that standard traffic light systems need extra wits as more connected cars and electric commercial fleets hit the roads.\nAs part of a \u00a330m investment in better urban connectivity, the city of Manchester is testing an AI traffic lights system. The city is installing a network of edge devices for collecting real-time road data on each junction and plans to use 5G technology for dispatching data to the cloud for analysis.\nLondon, in partnership with Siemens, is testing a real-time adaptive traffic signals control (ATSC) solution called Sitraffic FUSION that is powered by data from connected vehicles and connected road infrastructure. Sitraffic FUSION can detect, model, and optimize routes for all modes of transport around the set KPIs. The system also includes a traffic light algorithm for optimizing controls on signalized junctions and pedestrian crossings.\nMany more cities are looking into modernizing their traffic controls \u2014 and that means plenty of opportunities for new market entrants.\nHow do smart traffic lights work?\nSmart traffic signals are equipped with sensing, video capture, and connectivity technologies to collect real-time data from the environment. The obtained data is either pre-processed on the device or transmitted to a cloud-based transport management system, where it\u2019s processed by a predictive traffic light algorithm that generates instructions for signal adjustments.\nA standard smart traffic light system has two elements:\n\nSmart traffic light hardware\nA smart roadside traffic light unit still has the familiar three-light interface \u2014 and some extra goodies.\nThe exact configuration differs by manufacturer. Some smart traffic lights have more advanced sensing capabilities; others just rely on camera footage. NoTraffic, for example, uses IoT sensors that rely on radar and computer vision for smart signaling and also captures car data in C-V2X and DSRC formats.\nCloud control center\nOn the software side, a smart traffic light system can process data in two ways: on-device (on the edge) or in a cloud location.\nOn-edge road data pre-processing reduces latency. With suitable hardware, you can run baseline traffic conditions analysis on a smart traffic light device. For example, such roadside units can:\nOn-edge processing is a pillar for implementing adaptive traffic signals control (ATSC) \u2014 real-time traffic signal adjustments based on the current road situation. ATSC systems can reduce average travel times by 25%, shorten signal wait times by 40%, and lower emissions by 20% according to Carnegie Mellon University.\nNext, digital traffic signals can dispatch pre-processed and raw data to a connected cloud-based control center, such as an intelligent transport system (ITS). Here you can perform more advanced modeling and predictive analysis to stave off traffic congestion and harmonize public transport schedules.\nLikewise, you can use historical data collected by edge devices to build advanced models for:\nLearn more about uses of big data in urban planning\nMust-have features for a smart traffic light system\nSmart traffic light technology adds a new dimension of real-time control \u2014 and many good things come as a result:\nTo provide the above benefits to urban planners, future traffic lights should include the following four features.\nTraffic management software development\nAdaptive traffic signals control (ATSC) for urban traffic\nPredictive algorithms operating at the back end of a smart traffic light system can find effective solutions to complex traffic management problems. Such systems can correlate traffic signaling rules with violation or accident rates \u2014 and model risk-minimizing scenarios with higher precision than a human traffic manager could (plus do so in real time).\nOver time, a predictive smart traffic lights system can rely on sensors and visual data alone to make on-the-spot decisions and control traffic movements.\nCase in point: A group of German researchers recently collaborated with city planners in Lemgo on an AI program for traffic light management. The team used a set of high-resolution cameras and radar sensors to capture traffic data. Then they trained a deep learning algorithm to regulate signaling at a busy intersection.\nThe algorithm was tasked with estimating the optimal switching behavior for the traffic lights and the best phase sequence to reduce:\nDuring the simulation run, the algorithm managed to achieve a 10% to 15% improvement in traffic throughput in the tested area.\nIntegrated Emergency Vehicle Signal Preemption (EVSP)\nEmergency vehicles need priority access to the roads. The chance of survival is reduced by 7% to 10% for every minute emergency medical assistance is delayed. Likewise, the consequences of delayed arrival of police, firefighters, and other emergency services can be grave.\nYet emergency vehicles often get stuck in heavy traffic where drivers have to move aside to let the emergency go through. A signaling system with a smart emergency vehicle traffic light changer can address the matter in four ways:\nCase in point: A recent US study of smart traffic signal preemption for emergency vehicles found some interesting insights.\nEco-driving mode\nVrooming engines at busy intersections create a layer of noise and air pollution. Plus, they make areas with busy intersections less desirable for urban dwellers \u2014 a factor that also affects a neighborhood\u2019s economic development.\nSmart traffic signals can help reduce vehicle idle time and promote more sustainable driving habits. A group of Taiwanese scientists carefully documented a set of eco-driving traffic light regulation models that can be implemented in sensor-based traffic light systems.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSource: MDPI \u2014 Design and Implementation of a Smart Traffic Signal Control System for Smart City Applications\nTheir findings have already been put into action by the PTV Group in Taipei. The PTV Balance software platform can detect changes in traffic patterns and suggest smart stop light signals for cars, cyclists, and pedestrians.\nTaipei authorities tested the platform in two districts, Neihu and Nangang. The results were impressive:\nMicro-mobility priority service\nMicromobility vehicles such as bikes, e-bikes, and e-scooters are a growing part of the MaaS ecosystem. But they also present extra road hazards, both for pedestrians and drivers. In the first half of 2021, e-scooter crashes in London grew by 2,800% compared to the entirety of 2018.\nAs the use of personal and shared micromobility solutions surges, their movements must be better regulated. Smart traffic light systems should factor in these road players and create better controls for them.\nFor maximum safety, it\u2019s best to adopt a two-step mechanism:\nPeek Traffic has developed an interesting smart mobility solution for regulating cyclists and pedestrians They aim to connect all road users to an intelligent traffic control system via an ITS app. The app, in turn, sends signals to a smart traffic light control system. So when a vulnerable pedestrian attempts to cross the street, the app can issue an update to a connected traffic light so that it automatically adjusts the signal lengths. The same app can also inform the traffic light system about approaching cyclists to adjust the timing for them. Such dynamic traffic lights on cycling roads make bike use more attractive, which carries lots of benefits.\nSmart Signaling for Safer Mobility\nThe impact of smart traffic light systems extends beyond mere driver convenience; it can create a cascade of positive effects:\nGiven that our current traffic control systems are over a century old, updates are overdue.\nIntellias is a technology partner to leading companies in the transportation sector.

This study aims to observe the present context of the traffic lights, one of the solutions to traffic control most used in our time. This study will also look some solutions already implemented by the cities of Los Angeles and Recife using sensors and cameras at intersections, in order to optimize traffic control in real time. The proposal will be a system of intelligent traffic lights based on big data from navigation and traffic applications, which adapt the traffic lights depending on traffic flow, contributing to the improvement of systemically traffic control instruments, generating immediate gains in quality of life in cities.\nINTRODUCTION\nBig cities have several challenges for us to tackle; one of them is the issue of urban mobility. \u201cThe United Nations projected that half of the world\u2019s population would live in urban areas at the end of 2008\u201d. Nowadays, predictions say that by 2050 about 64% of the developing world and 86% of the developed world will be urbanized [1].\nThrough what these prediction shows, it is necessary to think seriously about the problems in the urban environment. One of the major problems of urban mobility is the massive use of cars. This matter is not simple to solve since the cars are one their urban environments, the majority of the cities are living in the car paradigm, as Recife city, which has the biggest flux of car in Brazil.\nThe following article proposes a discussion about how the traffic lights, one of the major instruments in traffic control of big cities around the world, can be smarter by relying on the data collected by the drivers using apps like Waze and Google Maps. Section II focuses on discussions about urban mobility. Sections III and IV highlight some existing solutions in traffic light, and briefly analyze them. Section V, some proposals are discussed and future researches are suggested.\nWORLD REALITY\nFor the last few years, the number of people that live in the urban area has surpassed the amount living in rural areas [2]. Figure 1 shows in 2050 the urban population will account for 6 billion people out of a total 9 billion.\nPopulation growth in urban centers and the lack of infrastructure are the main factors that affect the urban mobility, causing traffic problems and jams [3].\nRecent politics of income redistribution in Brazil had increased the car sales for the past ten years.\n\u201cBrazil is the world\u2019s fourth-biggest auto market and a major base of operations for Italy\u2019s Fiat SpA, Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG and U.S.-based General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.\u201d[4].\nEven with the decrease in sales over the past years, the big urban centers in Brazil are congested with cars. Recife is one of the cities with traffic problem and one of the biggest cities in the northwest of Brazil. A research published in a local newspaper shows that Recife is the city has a large number of streets with traffic jam during rush hours in Brazil .\nThe increase in numbers of cars on the streets is not the only reason in this matter; there is a lack of planning to deal with this amount of cars. For example, it is very common for someone to wait a traffic light to become green even if there is no car in the street. This might intensify the traffic jams instead of work as a traffic controller [5].\nThe problem of traffic jams in cities is not an easy problem solved. It is necessary to improve the public transportation system and allow people to be less dependent on their cars. In addition, it is necessary to stimulate other possibilities of transportation, to improve safety on the streets, to increase people security feelings and walkability through the streets and many more steps. One of these steps is to use big data to help to improve the traffic lights control.\nEXISTING SOLUTIONS\nThe city of Los Angeles, one with the worst traffic jams in the USA, has already a system that uses big data to control the traffic lights. The New York Times gives a breakdown of how it all works:\n\u201cMagnetic sensors in the road at every intersection send real-time updates about the traffic flow through fiber-optic cables to a bunker beneath downtown Los Angeles, where Edward Yu runs the network. The computer system, which runs software the city itself developed, analyzes the data and automatically makes second-by-second adjustments, adapting to changing conditions and using a trove of past data to predict where traffic could snarl, all without human involvement\u201d [6].\nFurther information about the smart grid system, used in Los Angeles, and how it works, could see below:\n\u201cThe system is intelligent in that it can automatically adjust the time delay between light changes whenever issues arise. So, for example, if there is an accident that causes one or more lanes to be closed on any highway in the city (thus causing a bottleneck), it can adjust the lights and give more time to let cars caught up in it all pass through. Alternatively, it can also be used to help keep public transport running on time \u2014 if the buses are late, the system can help them to pass through the lights faster and get back on schedule\u201d[7].\nThis system slightly improved the traffic in the city, according to officials, the average time to drive 5 miles in the city before was 20 minutes. These smart traffic lights have reduced to just 17.2 minutes.\n2. Recife city\nSome actions have already been tested to improve the traffic control in Recife City: some traffic lights use cameras to make the time that they stay green or red more effective, according to the traffic on the streets without the need of a pre-programed pattern. With these smart traffic lights, the control of the traffic flow is done at real time. Above, Figure 2 shows how the adaptive urban traffic control system works.\nDISCUSSIONS\nLooking at Los Angeles and Recife solutions it is possible to observe the need of the installation and maintenance of a great number of sensors around the city. Possibly, leads to a high cost for the execution of these services. There is also the need of the development of a system that controls and updates the data of the traffic lights. Besides that, these sensors just work for the nearby traffic and cannot understand what is happening with the traffic around the city as a whole.\nAnother aspect of this idea is the possibility of use sensors that are already on the streets and do not depend on government agencies to work; they just need smart citizens feeding data for their own good. This approach can possibly lead to a lower cost of implementation and maintenance compared to the Los Angeles and Recife solutions that need the implementation and maintenance of sensors around the city.\nPROPOSALS\nThe proposal, looking at these examples, is a new approach for these big data traffic lights. Instead of using a lot of time and money building an infrastructure of magnetic sensors in every road intersection, use data gathered by the drivers and shared trough the web using apps like Waze or Google maps. The drivers rely on this information for their daily commutes. We could use the data gathered by the drivers to help us improve the time and flux of the traffic lights.\nSome actions are performed to enable the traffic light system of Smart Cities to control the traffic light based on the current traffic situation. Some traffic lights have camera assistance to help define the green\u2019s and red\u2019s pace in order to the traffic flow of each street and avenue. In other words, in those smart traffic lights, the control of the traffic done in real time.\nFINAL DISCUSSIONS\nObserving this quick discussion, proposed in this paper, it is already possible to see the huge potential of using mobile sensors available in smartphones and other smart objects to solve problems in the city, in this case, urban mobility. These sensors have already improved the traffic for many people individually, for those who use it to see the traffic flow, and take an alternative route, for example, it is time utilize for a greater good of the whole community. The use of the big data information, generated by these sensors that are connected in social networks, and connected with traffic lights, can bring new possibilities for a better optimization of traffic flow and can generate algorithms that may help government agencies to create solutions that improve urban mobility.\nThis short discussion above is just an initial effort to study the possibilities of the use of big data to improve the traffic flow in big cities and with further research can lead to the creation of a \u201csmart traffic light\u201d that connect with the huge amount of information generated by the users and shared through social networks. Future studies will focus on user research, data mining techniques, and solutions that use big data for urban mobility.\nIt is also important to think about the possibilities of the user as an active agent in the city, 20 years ago the way that cities were thought isolated people from the idea of community, with people living side by side without knowing each other and without feeling being part of a complex system. Now, with the possibility of being connected with even more people, it is necessary to look carefully how the social networks are changing the way that people live and interact with each other using the city as a medium. This matter goes beyond the improvement in life quality it is a matter of survival.\n--\n--\nWritten by Jandu\u00ed Jorge\nHead of Product & Design at Edify Education. MSc at CESAR.Edu .

      "Edition\n\n\n            After a delay, New York City is moving ahead with congestion pricing to improve traffic, air quality and public\u00a0transit\n          \n\nAuthor\n\n      Professor Emeritus of Public Policy, University of Maryland, Baltimore County\n    \nDisclosure statement\nJohn Rennie Short does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\nPartners\n\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County provides funding as a member of The Conversation US.\nView all partners\nNew York City is poised to launch the first congestion pricing plan to reduce traffic in a major U.S. metropolitan area on Jan. 5, 2025. Like many journeys in the Big Apple, this one has been punctuated by delays, including a pause that Gov. Kathy Hochul imposed in early June 2024 as the plan was about to launch. \nNow, however, Hochul has resuscitated the plan with a new US$9 fee for private cars to enter Manhattan, down from $15 in the earlier iteration. It remains to be seen whether this version can withstand resistance and legal challenges from New Jersey officials, car commuters and President-elect Donald Trump. \nAssuming that the system starts up, it\u2019s expected to significantly reduce gridlock in Manhattan and generate billions of dollars to improve public transit citywide. \nThe basic idea is simple. To enter the Congestion Relief Zone, which covers Manhattan south of 60th Street, under new rates announced by Hochul, large trucks will now pay $21.60, small trucks $14.40, passenger vehicles $9 and motorcycles $4.50. Ride-share vehicles and taxis will pay $1.50 and $0.75, respectively. Peak hours run from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends; overnight tolls are discounted by 75%.\nPassenger vehicles that are not part of the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system will pay $13.50 during peak periods. \nEvidence from cities around the world shows that charging motorists fees for driving into city centers during busy periods is a rarity in urban public policy: a measure that works and is cost-effective. Congestion pricing has succeeded in cities including London, Singapore and Stockholm, where it has eased traffic, sped up travel times, reduced pollution and provided funds for public transportation and infrastructure investments.\nAs an urban policy scholar, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing New York\u2019s plan go into effect. There may well be surprises and adjustments as officials see how it works in practice. But given the heavy costs that traffic imposes on public health and productivity, I\u2019m encouraged to see a major U.S. city finally test this approach.\nNudging drivers\nCongestion pricing is a response to externalities \u2013 costs or benefits that are generated by one party but incurred by another. Clogged city streets and air pollution are externalities created by urban car users, many of whom live outside the city. \nThis concept has been around for some time. British economist Arthur Pigou discussed it as early as 1920 as part of his attempt to remedy the suboptimal workings of the market system. In Pigou\u2019s view, taxing harmful activities would discourage people from engaging in them. \nOther thinkers took up this idea. In 1963, Canadian economist William Vickrey, a future Nobel laureate, argued that roads were scarce resources that needed to be valued by imposing costs on users. \nThis approach is behind behavioral economics, the policy strategy of using \u201cnudges\u201d that preserve choice but encourage certain actions. Congestion pricing assumes that increased prices will make people heading into New York think more carefully about their travel patterns, and about alternatives to driving. \nPublic transit receives priority\nCongestion pricing in a city a big as New York is no small step. The New York plan was presented to the board of the Metropolitan Transit Authority in November 2023 after years of study and a detailed environmental impact assessment, required by federal law.\nProject sponsors, which include several city agencies and the state transportation department, stated in the impact assessment that on an average weekday, an estimated 1.86 million people entered lower Manhattan by motor vehicle. Travel speeds in Manhattan\u2019s central business district, below 60th Street, declined by 23% between 2010 and 2019, from 9.1 to 7.1 mph. The traffic was generating air and noise pollution, wasting travelers\u2019 time, increasing business costs and preventing emergency vehicles from responding quickly to accidents. \nThe agencies estimated that the proposed toll system would reduce traffic in the Congestion Relief Zone by 17%, with an associated decline in air pollution. It also would generate US$15 billion for capital improvements to the city\u2019s public transit system, including making stations accessible for passengers with disabilities and buying new electric buses and commuter rail and subway cars. \nMore than 75% of all trips into the central business district are made by public transit. The system has been plagued by breakdowns over the past decade. The Metropolitan Transit Authority recently adopted a $52 billion capital improvement program to update its network, some parts of which are more than 100 years old.\nOver several months of public hearings, the MTA heard both broad support for congestion pricing and thousands of requests for credits, discounts and exemptions, most of which were denied. The limited number of exemptions includes private commuter buses, school buses and city-owned vehicles, including emergency vehicles. \nIn addition, drivers who travel via Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive on Manhattan\u2019s eastern edge, the West Side Highway on its western edge, or the Carey Tunnel between Brooklyn and Battery Park will not be charged if they do not enter any street in the Congestion Relief Zone. Drivers from the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island will be eligible for rebates and discounts on certain bridge tolls.\nThere were widespread complaints from New Yorkers in the outer boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, and from car commuters who live outside of the city. New Jersey is suing the MTA, arguing among other things that the plan is unconstitutional because it burdens interstate commerce. This suit, which is ongoing, could delay the start of congestion pricing. \nNonetheless, the board adopted the plan with just one dissenting vote, from a representative of Nassau County on Long Island.   \nStarting the journey\nMany questions will only be answered once the system starts up. Will toll prices be high enough to spur people to switch to another mode of transportation or combine trips, while still generating enough revenue for the MTA\u2019s ambitious capital improvement program? How will toll revenue be spent? And how will commuters respond when they find that trains and subways initially are more crowded, before capital upgrades improve the system? \nSome low-income and minority communities that already experience heavy traffic, such as the Bronx, could see increased congestion as drivers detour around the toll zone. To help mitigate some of these effects, the transit authority is planning to invest millions of dollars to reduce pollution in these environmental justice areas through steps such as installing air filters in schools, planting more trees and electrifying trucks at the massive Hunts Point Food Distribution Center in the Bronx. \nNo one likes to pay for something that was previously free. But freedom for car users has imposed health and economic costs on millions of New Yorkers for many years. Congestion charges do raise equity issues, but only 5% percent of people who commute into the central business district travel by car, and most of those drivers have relatively high incomes. \nThe MTA may need to adjust tolls, the zone\u2019s borders or other aspects of the plan. But if New York\u2019s experiment succeeds, it could provide a model and valuable insights for other traffic-clogged U.S. cities.\nThis article was originally published on April 10, 2024, and has been updated to reflect the pause on implementing congestion pricing imposed by Gov.

      "The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\nIf 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI (gen AI), 2024 is the year organizations truly began using\u2014and deriving business value from\u2014this new technology. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey\u00a0on AI, 65 percent of respondents report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double the percentage from our previous survey just ten months ago. Respondents\u2019 expectations for gen AI\u2019s impact remain as high as they were last year, with three-quarters predicting that gen AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead.\nAbout the authors\nThis article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Lareina Yee, and Michael Chui, with Bryce Hall, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and McKinsey Digital.\nOrganizations are already seeing material benefits from gen AI use, reporting both cost decreases and revenue jumps in the business units deploying the technology. The survey also provides insights into the kinds of risks presented by gen AI\u2014most notably, inaccuracy\u2014as well as the emerging practices of top performers to mitigate those challenges and capture value.\nAI adoption surges\nInterest in generative AI has also brightened the spotlight on a broader set of AI capabilities. For the past six years, AI adoption by respondents\u2019 organizations has hovered at about 50 percent. This year, the survey finds that adoption has jumped to 72 percent (Exhibit 1). And the interest is truly global in scope. Our 2023 survey found that AI adoption did not reach 66 percent in any region; however, this year more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region say their organizations are using AI.1Organizations based in Central and South America are the exception, with 58 percent of respondents working for organizations based in Central and South America reporting AI adoption. Looking by industry, the biggest increase in adoption can be found in professional services.2Includes respondents working for organizations focused on human resources, legal services, management consulting, market research, R&D, tax preparation, and training.\nAlso, responses suggest that companies are now using AI in more parts of the business. Half of respondents say their organizations have adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from less than a third of respondents in 2023 (Exhibit 2).\nGen AI adoption is most common in the functions where it can create the most value\nMost respondents now report that their organizations\u2014and they as individuals\u2014are using gen AI. Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year. The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development\u2014two functions in which previous research\u00a0determined that gen AI adoption could generate the most value3\u201cThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,\u201d McKinsey, June 14, 2023.\u2014as well as in IT (Exhibit 3). The biggest increase from 2023 is found in marketing and sales, where reported adoption has more than doubled. Yet across functions, only two use cases, both within marketing and sales, are reported by 15 percent or more of respondents.\nGen AI also is weaving its way into respondents\u2019 personal lives. Compared with 2023, respondents are much more likely to be using gen AI at work and even more likely to be using gen AI both at work and in their personal lives (Exhibit 4). The survey finds upticks in gen AI use across all regions, with the largest increases in Asia\u2013Pacific and Greater China. Respondents at the highest seniority levels, meanwhile, show larger jumps in the use of gen Al tools for work and outside of work compared with their midlevel-management peers. Looking at specific industries, respondents working in energy and materials and in professional services report the largest increase in gen AI use.\nInvestments in gen AI and analytical AI are beginning to create value\nThe latest survey also shows how different industries are budgeting for gen AI. Responses suggest that, in many industries, organizations are about equally as likely to be investing more than 5 percent of their digital budgets in gen AI as they are in nongenerative, analytical-AI solutions (Exhibit 5). Yet in most industries, larger shares of respondents report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent on analytical AI than on gen AI. Looking ahead, most respondents\u201467 percent\u2014expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years.\nWhere are those investments paying off? For the first time, our latest survey explored the value created by gen AI use by business function. The function in which the largest share of respondents report seeing cost decreases is human resources. Respondents most commonly report meaningful revenue increases (of more than 5 percent) in supply chain and inventory management (Exhibit 6). For analytical AI, respondents most often report seeing cost benefits in service operations\u2014in line with what we found last year\u2014as well as meaningful revenue increases from AI use in marketing and sales.\nInaccuracy: The most recognized and experienced risk of gen AI use\nAs businesses begin to see the benefits of gen AI, they\u2019re also recognizing the diverse risks associated with the technology. These can range from data management risks such as data privacy, bias, or intellectual property (IP) infringement to model management risks, which tend to focus on inaccurate output or lack of explainability. A third big risk category is security and incorrect use.\nRespondents to the latest survey are more likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider inaccuracy and IP infringement to be relevant to their use of gen AI, and about half continue to view cybersecurity as a risk (Exhibit 7).\nConversely, respondents are less likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider workforce and labor displacement to be relevant risks and are not increasing efforts to mitigate them.\nIn fact, inaccuracy\u2014which can affect use cases across the gen AI value chain, ranging from customer journeys and summarization to coding and creative content\u2014is the only risk that respondents are significantly more likely than last year to say their organizations are actively working to mitigate.\nSome organizations have already experienced negative consequences from the use of gen AI, with 44 percent of respondents saying their organizations have experienced at least one consequence (Exhibit 8). Respondents most often report inaccuracy as a risk that has affected their organizations, followed by cybersecurity and explainability.\nOur previous research has found that there are several elements of governance that can help in scaling gen AI use responsibly, yet few respondents report having these risk-related practices in place.4\u201cImplementing generative AI with speed and safety,\u201d McKinsey Quarterly, March 13, 2024. For example, just 18 percent say their organizations have an enterprise-wide council or board with the authority to make decisions involving responsible AI governance, and only one-third say gen AI risk awareness and risk mitigation controls are required skill sets for technical talent.\nBringing gen AI capabilities to bear\nThe latest survey also sought to understand how, and how quickly, organizations are deploying these new gen AI tools. We have found three archetypes for implementing gen AI solutions: takers use off-the-shelf, publicly available solutions; shapers customize those tools with proprietary data and systems; and makers develop their own foundation models from scratch.5\u201cTechnology\u2019s generational moment with generative AI: A CIO and CTO guide,\u201d McKinsey, July 11, 2023. Across most industries, the survey results suggest that organizations are finding off-the-shelf offerings applicable to their business needs\u2014though many are pursuing opportunities to customize models or even develop their own (Exhibit 9). About half of reported gen AI uses within respondents\u2019 business functions are utilizing off-the-shelf, publicly available models or tools, with little or no customization. Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs.\nRespondents most often report that their organizations required one to four months from the start of a project to put gen AI into production, though the time it takes varies by business function (Exhibit 10). It also depends upon the approach for acquiring those capabilities. Not surprisingly, reported uses of highly customized or proprietary models are 1.5 times more likely than off-the-shelf, publicly available models to take five months or more to implement.\nGen AI high performers are excelling despite facing challenges\nGen AI is a new technology, and organizations are still early in the journey of pursuing its opportunities and scaling it across functions. So it\u2019s little surprise that only a small subset of respondents (46 out of 876) report that a meaningful share of their organizations\u2019 EBIT can be attributed to their deployment of gen AI. Still, these gen AI leaders are worth examining closely. These, after all, are the early movers, who already attribute more than 10 percent of their organizations\u2019 EBIT to their use of gen AI. Forty-two percent of these high performers say more than 20 percent of their EBIT is attributable to their use of nongenerative, analytical AI, and they span industries and regions\u2014though most are at organizations with less than $1 billion in annual revenue. The AI-related practices at these organizations can offer guidance to those looking to create value from gen AI adoption at their own organizations.\nTo start, gen AI high performers are using gen AI in more business functions\u2014an average of three functions, while others average two. They, like other organizations, are most likely to use gen AI in marketing and sales and product or service development, but they\u2019re much more likely than others to use gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance; and in supply chain and inventory management. They\u2019re more than three times as likely as others to be using gen AI in activities ranging from processing of accounting documents and risk assessment to R&D testing and pricing and promotions. While, overall, about half of reported gen AI applications within business functions are utilizing publicly available models or tools, gen AI high performers are less likely to use those off-the-shelf options than to either implement significantly customized versions of those tools or to develop their own proprietary foundation models.\nWhat else are these high performers doing differently? For one thing, they are paying more attention to gen-AI-related risks. Perhaps because they are further along on their journeys, they are more likely than others to say their organizations have experienced every negative consequence from gen AI we asked about, from cybersecurity and personal privacy to explainability and IP infringement. Given that, they are more likely than others to report that their organizations consider those risks, as well as regulatory compliance, environmental impacts, and political stability, to be relevant to their gen AI use, and they say they take steps to mitigate more risks than others do.\nGen AI high performers are also much more likely to say their organizations follow a set of risk-related best practices (Exhibit 11). For example, they are nearly twice as likely as others to involve the legal function and embed risk reviews early on in the development of gen AI solutions\u2014that is, to \u201cshift left.\u201d They\u2019re also much more likely than others to employ a wide range of other best practices, from strategy-related practices to those related to scaling.\nIn addition to experiencing the risks of gen AI adoption, high performers have encountered other challenges that can serve as warnings to others (Exhibit 12). Seventy percent say they have experienced difficulties with data, including defining processes for data governance, developing the ability to quickly integrate data into AI models, and an insufficient amount of training data, highlighting the essential role that data play in capturing value. High performers are also more likely than others to report experiencing challenges with their operating models, such as implementing agile ways of working and effective sprint performance management.\nAbout the research\nThe online survey was in the field from February 22 to March 5, 2024, and garnered responses from 1,363 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 981 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one business function, and 878 said their organizations were regularly using gen AI in at least one function.

      "The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\nIf 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI (gen AI), 2024 is the year organizations truly began using\u2014and deriving business value from\u2014this new technology. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey\u00a0on AI, 65 percent of respondents report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double the percentage from our previous survey just ten months ago. Respondents\u2019 expectations for gen AI\u2019s impact remain as high as they were last year, with three-quarters predicting that gen AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead.\nAbout the authors\nThis article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Lareina Yee, and Michael Chui, with Bryce Hall, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and McKinsey Digital.\nOrganizations are already seeing material benefits from gen AI use, reporting both cost decreases and revenue jumps in the business units deploying the technology. The survey also provides insights into the kinds of risks presented by gen AI\u2014most notably, inaccuracy\u2014as well as the emerging practices of top performers to mitigate those challenges and capture value.\nAI adoption surges\nInterest in generative AI has also brightened the spotlight on a broader set of AI capabilities. For the past six years, AI adoption by respondents\u2019 organizations has hovered at about 50 percent. This year, the survey finds that adoption has jumped to 72 percent (Exhibit 1). And the interest is truly global in scope. Our 2023 survey found that AI adoption did not reach 66 percent in any region; however, this year more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region say their organizations are using AI.1Organizations based in Central and South America are the exception, with 58 percent of respondents working for organizations based in Central and South America reporting AI adoption. Looking by industry, the biggest increase in adoption can be found in professional services.2Includes respondents working for organizations focused on human resources, legal services, management consulting, market research, R&D, tax preparation, and training.\nAlso, responses suggest that companies are now using AI in more parts of the business. Half of respondents say their organizations have adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from less than a third of respondents in 2023 (Exhibit 2).\nGen AI adoption is most common in the functions where it can create the most value\nMost respondents now report that their organizations\u2014and they as individuals\u2014are using gen AI. Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year. The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development\u2014two functions in which previous research\u00a0determined that gen AI adoption could generate the most value3\u201cThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,\u201d McKinsey, June 14, 2023.\u2014as well as in IT (Exhibit 3). The biggest increase from 2023 is found in marketing and sales, where reported adoption has more than doubled. Yet across functions, only two use cases, both within marketing and sales, are reported by 15 percent or more of respondents.\nGen AI also is weaving its way into respondents\u2019 personal lives. Compared with 2023, respondents are much more likely to be using gen AI at work and even more likely to be using gen AI both at work and in their personal lives (Exhibit 4). The survey finds upticks in gen AI use across all regions, with the largest increases in Asia\u2013Pacific and Greater China. Respondents at the highest seniority levels, meanwhile, show larger jumps in the use of gen Al tools for work and outside of work compared with their midlevel-management peers. Looking at specific industries, respondents working in energy and materials and in professional services report the largest increase in gen AI use.\nInvestments in gen AI and analytical AI are beginning to create value\nThe latest survey also shows how different industries are budgeting for gen AI. Responses suggest that, in many industries, organizations are about equally as likely to be investing more than 5 percent of their digital budgets in gen AI as they are in nongenerative, analytical-AI solutions (Exhibit 5). Yet in most industries, larger shares of respondents report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent on analytical AI than on gen AI. Looking ahead, most respondents\u201467 percent\u2014expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years.\nWhere are those investments paying off? For the first time, our latest survey explored the value created by gen AI use by business function. The function in which the largest share of respondents report seeing cost decreases is human resources. Respondents most commonly report meaningful revenue increases (of more than 5 percent) in supply chain and inventory management (Exhibit 6). For analytical AI, respondents most often report seeing cost benefits in service operations\u2014in line with what we found last year\u2014as well as meaningful revenue increases from AI use in marketing and sales.\nInaccuracy: The most recognized and experienced risk of gen AI use\nAs businesses begin to see the benefits of gen AI, they\u2019re also recognizing the diverse risks associated with the technology. These can range from data management risks such as data privacy, bias, or intellectual property (IP) infringement to model management risks, which tend to focus on inaccurate output or lack of explainability. A third big risk category is security and incorrect use.\nRespondents to the latest survey are more likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider inaccuracy and IP infringement to be relevant to their use of gen AI, and about half continue to view cybersecurity as a risk (Exhibit 7).\nConversely, respondents are less likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider workforce and labor displacement to be relevant risks and are not increasing efforts to mitigate them.\nIn fact, inaccuracy\u2014which can affect use cases across the gen AI value chain, ranging from customer journeys and summarization to coding and creative content\u2014is the only risk that respondents are significantly more likely than last year to say their organizations are actively working to mitigate.\nSome organizations have already experienced negative consequences from the use of gen AI, with 44 percent of respondents saying their organizations have experienced at least one consequence (Exhibit 8). Respondents most often report inaccuracy as a risk that has affected their organizations, followed by cybersecurity and explainability.\nOur previous research has found that there are several elements of governance that can help in scaling gen AI use responsibly, yet few respondents report having these risk-related practices in place.4\u201cImplementing generative AI with speed and safety,\u201d McKinsey Quarterly, March 13, 2024. For example, just 18 percent say their organizations have an enterprise-wide council or board with the authority to make decisions involving responsible AI governance, and only one-third say gen AI risk awareness and risk mitigation controls are required skill sets for technical talent.\nBringing gen AI capabilities to bear\nThe latest survey also sought to understand how, and how quickly, organizations are deploying these new gen AI tools. We have found three archetypes for implementing gen AI solutions: takers use off-the-shelf, publicly available solutions; shapers customize those tools with proprietary data and systems; and makers develop their own foundation models from scratch.5\u201cTechnology\u2019s generational moment with generative AI: A CIO and CTO guide,\u201d McKinsey, July 11, 2023. Across most industries, the survey results suggest that organizations are finding off-the-shelf offerings applicable to their business needs\u2014though many are pursuing opportunities to customize models or even develop their own (Exhibit 9). About half of reported gen AI uses within respondents\u2019 business functions are utilizing off-the-shelf, publicly available models or tools, with little or no customization. Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs.\nRespondents most often report that their organizations required one to four months from the start of a project to put gen AI into production, though the time it takes varies by business function (Exhibit 10). It also depends upon the approach for acquiring those capabilities. Not surprisingly, reported uses of highly customized or proprietary models are 1.5 times more likely than off-the-shelf, publicly available models to take five months or more to implement.\nGen AI high performers are excelling despite facing challenges\nGen AI is a new technology, and organizations are still early in the journey of pursuing its opportunities and scaling it across functions. So it\u2019s little surprise that only a small subset of respondents (46 out of 876) report that a meaningful share of their organizations\u2019 EBIT can be attributed to their deployment of gen AI. Still, these gen AI leaders are worth examining closely. These, after all, are the early movers, who already attribute more than 10 percent of their organizations\u2019 EBIT to their use of gen AI. Forty-two percent of these high performers say more than 20 percent of their EBIT is attributable to their use of nongenerative, analytical AI, and they span industries and regions\u2014though most are at organizations with less than $1 billion in annual revenue. The AI-related practices at these organizations can offer guidance to those looking to create value from gen AI adoption at their own organizations.\nTo start, gen AI high performers are using gen AI in more business functions\u2014an average of three functions, while others average two. They, like other organizations, are most likely to use gen AI in marketing and sales and product or service development, but they\u2019re much more likely than others to use gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance; and in supply chain and inventory management. They\u2019re more than three times as likely as others to be using gen AI in activities ranging from processing of accounting documents and risk assessment to R&D testing and pricing and promotions. While, overall, about half of reported gen AI applications within business functions are utilizing publicly available models or tools, gen AI high performers are less likely to use those off-the-shelf options than to either implement significantly customized versions of those tools or to develop their own proprietary foundation models.\nWhat else are these high performers doing differently? For one thing, they are paying more attention to gen-AI-related risks. Perhaps because they are further along on their journeys, they are more likely than others to say their organizations have experienced every negative consequence from gen AI we asked about, from cybersecurity and personal privacy to explainability and IP infringement. Given that, they are more likely than others to report that their organizations consider those risks, as well as regulatory compliance, environmental impacts, and political stability, to be relevant to their gen AI use, and they say they take steps to mitigate more risks than others do.\nGen AI high performers are also much more likely to say their organizations follow a set of risk-related best practices (Exhibit 11). For example, they are nearly twice as likely as others to involve the legal function and embed risk reviews early on in the development of gen AI solutions\u2014that is, to \u201cshift left.\u201d They\u2019re also much more likely than others to employ a wide range of other best practices, from strategy-related practices to those related to scaling.\nIn addition to experiencing the risks of gen AI adoption, high performers have encountered other challenges that can serve as warnings to others (Exhibit 12). Seventy percent say they have experienced difficulties with data, including defining processes for data governance, developing the ability to quickly integrate data into AI models, and an insufficient amount of training data, highlighting the essential role that data play in capturing value. High performers are also more likely than others to report experiencing challenges with their operating models, such as implementing agile ways of working and effective sprint performance management.\nAbout the research\nThe online survey was in the field from February 22 to March 5, 2024, and garnered responses from 1,363 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 981 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one business function, and 878 said their organizations were regularly using gen AI in at least one function. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data are weighted by the contribution of each respondent\u2019s nation to global GDP.\nAlex Singla and Alexander Sukharevsky\u00a0are global coleaders of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Chicago and London offices, respectively; Lareina Yee\u00a0is a senior partner in the Bay Area office, where Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner, is a partner; and Bryce Hall\u00a0is an associate partner in the Washington, DC, office.\nThey wish to thank Kaitlin Noe, Larry Kanter, Mallika Jhamb, and Shinjini Srivastava for their contributions to this work.\nThis article was edited by Heather Hanselman, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Atlanta office.",
      "\nIn this article\nABC Analysis is a method used in supply chain management to categorize inventory into three groups\u00e2\u0080\u0094A, B, and C\u00e2\u0080\u0094based on their importance. This classification helps businesses prioritize their resources and focus on the most critical items.\nAn Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN), sometimes referred to as Advance Ship Notice, is a notification sent by a supplier or manufacturer to a customer or retailer to provide detailed information about a pending shipment. The ASN serves as an electronic document that outlines the contents of the shipment before it physically arrives at the destination. \nAn agile supply chain is a flexible and responsive approach to supply chain management that enables organizations to quickly adapt to changing market conditions, customer demands, and disruptions. It focuses on enhancing speed, efficiency, and adaptability throughout the entire supply chain process, from sourcing raw materials to delivering finished products to customers.\nAn air waybill (AWB) is a vital logistics document used in air freight transportation. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper (consignor) and the airline (carrier), detailing the terms and conditions of air transportation for the shipment. The air waybill contains essential information such as the origin and destination of the cargo, the description of goods, the weight, and the freight charges.\nAn arrival notice is a notification sent by a carrier or freight forwarder to inform consignees or recipients that a shipment has arrived at its destination port or facility. This notice serves as an important communication tool in the supply chain, providing recipients with essential information about the arrival of their goods and detailing the next steps for delivery or pickup.\nAn Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a tracking system used in the maritime industry to monitor the location and movement of ships. AIS provides real-time information about vessel identification, position, course, and speed. \n\u00e2\u0080\u008dBackhauling is a transportation logistics practice where trucks carry a return load on their way back from delivering goods to their destination. Instead of returning empty, trucks utilize their empty space to transport goods from the destination back to the point of origin or another destination along the route. \nIn supply chain management, \"backorder\" refers to a situation where a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily unavailable in the seller's inventory. When an item is on backorder, it means the customer's order cannot be fulfilled immediately due to insufficient stock levels.\n\nA bay plan is a diagram that details the stowage of containers on a vessel, specifying their exact position by bay, row, and tier to ensure efficient and safe loading and unloading operations.\nA Beneficial Cargo Owner (BCO) is the entity with ownership or a beneficial interest in transported goods. While not always the shipper, the BCO reaps the benefits of the cargo's arrival. \nA bill of lading (B/L) is a legal document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract between the shipper (seller) and the carrier (transport provider), detailing the terms and conditions of transportation, including the type, quantity, and destination of the goods.\nBlank sailing is a term used to describe the situation when a shipping line cancels a scheduled port call or an entire voyage. This can happen for various reasons, such as low demand for shipping services, operational issues, or unforeseen circumstances like bad weather or port congestion.\nA blind shipment refers to a logistics practice where certain details about the shipment, such as the sender, receiver, or contents, are intentionally obscured or withheld from one or both parties involved in the transaction. This is typically done to maintain confidentiality or to prevent competitors from obtaining sensitive information about suppliers, customers, or pricing.\nA bonded warehouse is a secured facility authorized by customs authorities where imported goods can be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations without payment of duty.\nA booking confirmation is a document that verifies the reservation of space for cargo on a carrier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vessel, flight, or truck, ensuring all shipping arrangements are approved and scheduled.\nA request for reservation of space and equipment for a particular vessel/voyage and possibly inland transport.\nBreak bulk cargo refers to goods that are individually packaged or bundled, rather than being transported in containers or in bulk. These items are often large or irregular in size and include products like machinery, vehicles, construction materials, or heavy equipment. \nBuffer stock, also known as inventory buffer or stock buffer, refers to the extra inventory held by a company to mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by uncertainties in supply and demand. It acts as a cushion against fluctuations in customer demand, supply chain disruptions, and variations in lead times.\nBulk cargo refers to commodities that are transported unpackaged in large quantities, typically stored and handled in bulk form, rather than in individual units or containers. This category of cargo is crucial in global trade, especially for goods that are homogeneous and not easily damaged during transportation.\nThe bullwhip effect, also known as demand amplification or whiplash effect, is a phenomenon that occurs in supply chains where small fluctuations in demand at the consumer level lead to exaggerated fluctuations in demand further upstream in the supply chain. This amplification of demand variability causes inefficiencies, such as excess inventory, stockouts, and increased costs, as supply chain partners overreact to perceived demand changes.\nCIF, or Cost, Insurance, and Freight, is an international shipping agreement used in the transportation of goods. In freight shipping, CIF means that the seller takes responsibility for the cost of transporting goods to the buyer's destination port. This includes paying for shipping, handling, and insurance. The seller's obligations end when the goods reach the destination port, at which point the buyer assumes responsibility for customs clearance, import duties, and any further transport to their final destination.\nA Capesize ship is a large bulk carrier vessel designed to transport heavy raw materials across long distances, too large to transit through canals like the Panama or Suez.\nThe action of allowing cargo to leave the container yard typically authorized by the carrier. This is often confused with gate-out, but cargo release is the authorization necessary before shipments can be allowed to gate-out.\nA cargo survey is an inspection process that assesses the condition and quantity of goods during transportation to ensure compliance with shipping terms and prevent disputes.\nA shipping carrier is an organization that provides transportation services for goods. They manage the logistics of moving cargo, which includes loading, transporting, and delivering goods to the specified location. Shipping carriers handle various types of shipments, from small packages to large freight consignments, using different modes of transportation such as maritime, air, rail, and road.\nCarrier haulage refers to a transportation arrangement where the carrier, typically the ocean shipping line or its designated transport provider, is responsible for arranging and paying for the inland transportation of containers. In this scenario, the carrier takes charge of moving the container from the port of discharge to the final destination or vice versa, using their own transportation assets or subcontracted carriers.\nA carrier scorecard is a performance measurement tool used by supply chain and logistics professionals to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of their freight carriers. It provides a standardized way to assess carriers based on various performance metrics, helping organizations make informed decisions about their logistics partners\nA certificate of origin is a document issued by an authorized body or organization that certifies the country in which the goods being shipped were manufactured, produced, or processed. It serves as a declaration by the exporter to the customs authorities of the importing country, providing information about the origin of the goods and facilitating trade by ensuring compliance with trade agreements, tariffs, and regulations.\nA commercial invoice is a crucial document used in international trade transactions to provide details of the goods being shipped and their corresponding value. It serves as a formal request for payment from the buyer to the seller and is essential for customs clearance and regulatory compliance.\nIn shipping, a commodity refers to bulk goods or raw materials that are transported in large volumes as part of global trade.\nIn the realm of supply chain and logistics, the term \"Consignee\" refers to the individual, company, or entity to whom a shipment of goods is delivered. The consignee is the designated recipient or receiver of the goods, typically identified by name and address on shipping documents such as the bill of lading or delivery order.\nConsignment inventory is a supply chain arrangement where a supplier (consignor) retains ownership of goods while they are held at a customer's (consignee's) location. The consignee only pays for the goods when they are sold or consumed, and the supplier retains responsibility for managing and replenishing the inventory as needed.\nIn shipping and logistics, a consignor refers to the entity or person who is the sender or shipper of goods. The consignor is responsible for initiating the shipment of goods from one location to another, typically to a consignee or recipient.\nA container depot is a facility used for the storage, maintenance, and repair of empty shipping containers when they are not actively in use for transportation.\nContainer discharge is the process of unloading shipping containers from a vessel at a port, using cranes and other equipment, for onward transportation.\nA container freight station (CFS) is a designated facility where goods are received, sorted, and prepared for onward transportation, enhancing efficiency in logistics operations.\nShipping container grades classify containers based on their condition and suitability for transporting goods, ranging from cargo-worthy to as-is quality.\nA container packing certificate is a document that verifies the proper packing and loading of goods into a shipping container. It attests that the contents have been securely packed, arranged, and secured according to industry standards and regulatory requirements. Obtaining a container packing certificate is crucial for compliance with international shipping regulations and contractual obligations. It provides assurance that the goods have been properly prepared for transport, minimizing the risk of delays, damages, or disputes during the shipment process.\nA container rollover occurs when a shipping container is not loaded onto its scheduled vessel and is instead 'rolled over' to a subsequent vessel. This delay means the container misses its intended departure and must wait for the next available sailing, which can significantly impact lead times and delivery schedules.\nContainer stripping (devanning) is the process of unloading cargo from a shipping container at its destination for inspection, storage, or further distribution.\nContainer stuffing is the process of loading cargo into a shipping container in a safe and space-efficient manner for transportation.\nCross docking is a logistics strategy where incoming goods from suppliers are unloaded from incoming trucks or containers and directly loaded onto outbound trucks or trailers, with minimal or no storage time in between. Essentially, it involves transferring goods directly from the inbound dock to the outbound dock, bypassing the need for traditional warehousing storage.\nA customs broker is a licensed professional who specializes in facilitating the clearance of goods through customs barriers for importers and exporters. Acting as intermediaries between businesses and customs authorities, customs brokers ensure compliance with regulations and smooth passage of goods across international borders.\nCustoms clearance refers to the process of fulfilling the legal requirements necessary to facilitate the import or export of goods across international borders. This procedure ensures that shipments comply with local laws and regulations, allowing them to enter or leave a country legally. It involves various documentation, inspections, and payments of duties and taxes.\nA customs manifest lists in detail all the bills of lading issued by a carrier, its agent or master for a specific voyage and port call. It is a detailed summary of the total cargo of a vessel and is used principally for customs purposes. It acts as a declaration to customs authorities, ensuring compliance with regulations and facilitating smooth movement of goods through ports and checkpoints.\nThe latest point in time where a container has to be delivered to a terminal to be loaded on a vessel, or where certain documentation has to be provided by the Shipper.Example: CY cut-off, FCL cut-off, VGM cut-off, DG cut-off.\nCycle counting is a methodical approach to inventory management where a subset of inventory is counted on a continuous basis, typically throughout the year. Unlike traditional annual or periodic inventory counts that halt operations, cycle counting allows businesses to maintain regular operations while ensuring accurate stock levels.\nDAP, or Delivered At Place, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller's obligation to deliver goods to a designated location in the buyer's country. In DAP terms, the seller is responsible for all costs and risks associated with delivering the goods to the agreed-upon destination. This includes arranging transportation, handling charges, and insurance up to the point of delivery. The buyer, however, is responsible for unloading the goods, handling customs clearance, and paying any import duties and taxes once the goods arrive at the destination.\nDDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping terms dictate that the seller assumes all responsibilities and costs associated with delivering the goods to the buyer's specified destination. This includes transportation, insurance, handling charges, and import duties and taxes. Essentially, the seller handles everything from the point of origin to the final delivery location, ensuring the goods arrive ready for use by the buyer without any additional costs or logistical burdens.\nDDU, or Delivered Duty Unpaid, is an international shipping term that defines the responsibilities of the seller and buyer. Under DDU terms, the seller delivers the goods to a specified destination in the buyer's country, covering all costs and risks associated with transportation, except for duties, taxes, and other import charges which are the responsibility of the buyer. The seller's obligations include arranging and paying for freight, insurance, and handling charges until the goods reach the agreed-upon place.\nDPU, or Delivered at Place Unloaded, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller's responsibility to deliver and unload goods at a designated location in the buyer's country. Under DPU terms, the seller bears all costs and risks associated with transporting and unloading the goods at the agreed destination. This includes all transportation costs, including freight, insurance, and handling charges, up to and including the unloading of the goods at the destination. The buyer then takes over responsibility for import duties, taxes, customs clearance, and any further transport to the final destination. \nA dangerous goods declaration (DGD) is a legal document required for the transportation of hazardous materials or dangerous goods by air, sea, road, or rail. It provides detailed information about the nature, classification, packaging, and handling requirements of the dangerous goods being transported. The DGD helps ensure compliance with international regulations and facilitates the safe handling and transport of hazardous materials throughout the supply chain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008dDeadheading is the practice of operating a commercial vehicle, such as a truck or a trailer, without any cargo or paying passengers. Essentially, it refers to the movement of a vehicle while it is empty, either on its way to pick up a load or after delivering a load to its destination.\nDeadweight tonnage (DWT) is a measure of a ship's carrying capacity, representing the total weight of cargo, fuel, crew, provisions, and other materials that the vessel can safely carry. \nDemurrage refers to the additional charges imposed on the owner or operator of a vessel, freight car, or truck for delaying the use of equipment or facilities beyond the agreed-upon time. In the context of maritime shipping, demurrage applies to the time that cargo remains at the port or terminal beyond the allotted free time for loading or unloading.\nDetention charges are fees incurred when a carrier's equipment, such as containers or trailers, is held beyond the agreed-upon free time at a facility, such as a port, terminal, or warehouse. These charges compensate the carrier for the additional time their equipment is detained and unavailable for other use.\nA supply chain digital twin replicates the entire supply chain network, including assets, facilities, products, and processes, in a digital environment. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation of supply chain operations to improve efficiency, optimize decision-making, and mitigate risks.\nDimensional weight, also known as volumetric weight, is a pricing technique used by shipping carriers to calculate the cost of shipping packages based on their volume rather than just their actual weight. This method helps carriers account for the space that a package occupies in relation to its weight, ensuring fair pricing for shipping services.\nA dock receipt is a logistics document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge the receipt of goods at a shipping dock or terminal for transportation. It serves as a temporary receipt until the goods are loaded onto a vessel or other mode of transportation for shipment to their destination. The dock receipt contains essential information about the cargo, such as the quantity, description, condition, and destination, along with details about the carrier, shipper, and consignee.\nA ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s draft (draught) measures the depth of the vessel below the waterline, which determines the minimum water depth required for safe navigation.\n\nDrayage refers to the transportation of goods over a short distance, typically within the same metropolitan area or between nearby facilities. It plays a crucial role in the logistics and supply chain industry, linking various points in the transportation network, such as ports, rail terminals, and distribution centers. Drayage often involves moving goods from a transportation hub like a port to a nearby warehouse or vice versa.\nDrop shipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product using the drop shipping model, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer.\nDry bulk cargo refers to unpackaged, loose commodities that are shipped in large quantities and typically consist of raw materials. These goods are usually loaded directly into the holds of a vessel without any packaging, making them different from containerized or break bulk cargo. \nA booking received via Electronic Data Interchange, a standard electronic format for exchanging business documents within the supply chain, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipping notices, and other transactional information.\nAn Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number is a unique identifier assigned to businesses engaged in international trade within the European Union (EU) and certain other countries. It serves as a means of tracking and identifying entities involved in import, export, and other customs-related activities.\nIn shipping, ETA refers to the anticipated arrival time of a vessel, truck, or aircraft at a specified port or delivery location. It is calculated based on various factors such as the departure time, transit duration, and any potential delays due to weather, customs, or other unforeseen circumstances. This prediction helps logistics professionals plan and coordinate the movement of goods, ensuring timely deliveries and efficient supply chain management.\nEXW, or Ex Works, is one of the Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). It defines the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international transactions. Under EXW terms, the seller fulfills their obligation by making the goods available for pickup at their premises (factory, warehouse, etc.). The buyer assumes all risks and costs associated with transporting the goods from the seller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location to the final destination.\nEconomic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a fundamental concept in inventory management that determines the optimal quantity of goods a company should order to minimize total inventory costs. It balances the costs of holding inventory (holding costs) and the costs of ordering inventory (ordering costs) to find the most cost-effective quantity to order at any given time.\nAn Electronic Product Code (EPC) is a unique identifier used to distinguish individual items, cases, or pallets in the supply chain. It serves as a digital identifier that provides a standardized way to track and manage products throughout their lifecycle, from manufacturing to distribution to retail.\nUsed for storing cargo in/on during transport. The equipment \"size/type\" is defined by the ISO 6346 code. The most common equipment size/type is 20'/40'/45' Dry Freight Container, but a number of different versions exist.\nConfirmation & receipt of the equipment loaded/discharged on a vessel during a port call. This information is recorded by the terminal operator and sent to the carrier. This is often done using the EDI message - COARRI. The COARRI message reports that the equipment specified have been discharged from a seagoing vessel (discharged as ordered, over landed or short landed), or have been loaded into a seagoing vessel.\nA shipping exception is an unexpected event or disruption that causes a shipment to deviate from its planned delivery schedule.\nExpedited freight refers to a specialized service in logistics and supply chain management aimed at transporting goods quickly and efficiently to meet tight delivery deadlines. It is used when standard shipping methods cannot meet the required delivery timeframe, typically due to urgent customer needs, production delays, or unforeseen circumstances.\n\nFAS, or Free Alongside Ship, is a shipping term used in international trade that specifies the seller's responsibilities and costs up to the point where goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the designated port of shipment. The buyer then assumes all risks and costs from that point forward.\nFCA, or Free Carrier, is an Incoterm (International Commercial Term) used in international trade to define the point at which the seller's obligations are fulfilled and the buyer assumes responsibility for the goods. Under FCA, the seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier or another party nominated by the buyer at a specified place. \nFCL (Full Container Load) freight involves shipping an entire container for a single shipper, offering faster and more secure transport, especially for large-volume cargo.\nFOB, or Free on Board, is a term used in international trade to indicate when ownership and liability for goods transfer from the seller to the buyer. It specifies the point at which the seller is no longer responsible for the goods. This term is crucial for determining who pays for shipping, insurance, and other logistics costs, as well as who bears the risk during transit.\nAn entity operating a feeder service - ref. Feeder vessel.\nA container feeder vessel, also known as a feeder ship, is a relatively small cargo vessel that is specifically designed for transporting containers between smaller ports or terminals to larger hub ports where mainline vessels operate. These vessels serve as a crucial link in the global shipping network by facilitating the distribution of cargo to and from regional ports that may not be accessible to larger ships due to navigational constraints or limited infrastructure.\n\nA Feedermax container ship is a medium-sized vessel used to transport containers between regional ports and major ports, connecting smaller markets to global shipping routes.\nFill rate in supply chain management refers to the measurement of how fully customer demand for a product or service is met through the availability of inventory. It indicates the percentage of customer orders or demand that can be fulfilled immediately from stock, without backorders or delays.\nA \"Flag of Convenience\" (FOC) refers to the practice of a ship's owner registering a merchant vessel in a country other than the owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s country of origin to benefit from more favorable regulations, often related to taxes, labor laws, and safety standards. This practice allows shipowners to operate under less stringent regulations, often reducing operational costs and increasing profitability. However, FOC can also lead to concerns about safety, environmental standards, and working conditions for crew members, as the regulatory oversight in these flag states might not be as rigorous.\n4PL, or Fourth Party Logistics, refers to a logistics model where a single organization, known as the fourth-party logistics provider, takes on the responsibility of managing and coordinating the entire supply chain on behalf of the client. Unlike traditional third-party logistics (3PL) providers, who primarily handle specific logistics functions, 4PL providers offer comprehensive end-to-end supply chain management services. 4PL providers act as strategic partners, overseeing multiple 3PLs and other service providers to optimize supply chain operations, enhance efficiency, and achieve cost savings for their clients.\nA free trade zone (FTZ) is a designated area within a country where goods can be imported, stored, manufactured, or exported without being subject to the usual customs duties and tariffs. \nA freight forwarder is a vital link in the supply chain, specializing in the coordination and management of international shipments. Acting as an intermediary between shippers and carriers, freight forwarders handle various logistics tasks such as booking cargo space, arranging transportation, preparing documentation, and managing customs clearance.\nFreight visibility (also called shipment visibility) refers to the ability of supply chain professionals to track and monitor the movement of freight shipments throughout the supply chain. It involves gaining real-time insights into the location and status of goods as they move through various transportation modes and stages of the logistics process.\n\nFull truckload (FTL) freight refers to shipments that occupy the entire capacity of a truck trailer. Unlike less than truckload (LTL) shipments, FTL shipments do not share space with other cargo, allowing for direct transportation from the point of origin to the destination without intermediate stops.\nThe GLEC (Global Logistics Emissions Council) framework is a globally recognized standard developed to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from logistics activities. It provides guidelines and best practices for calculating emissions across various modes of transport, including road, rail, sea, and air. \nThe action of moving a container from a container yard, a terminal or another restricted/controlled area.\nThe German Supply Chain Act, also known as Lieferkettengesetz, is a landmark legislation enacted to promote corporate social responsibility and ensure ethical practices throughout global supply chains. Introduced in 2021, the law applies to German companies with over 3,000 employees, requiring them to monitor and address human rights abuses, environmental violations, and labor standards in their supply chains.\nA Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) is a unique identifier assigned to products in the supply chain to facilitate efficient tracking and management from production to point of sale. It provides a standardized method for identifying items globally, ensuring accurate inventory control, and enabling seamless transactions between trading partners.\n\nA Goods Receipt Note (GRN) is a document used in the process of confirming the receipt of goods from a supplier or vendor. It serves as an acknowledgment by the receiving party, typically a warehouse or a buyer, that the goods specified in the accompanying purchase order have been received in satisfactory condition. \nGreen logistics refers to the process of minimizing the environmental impact of logistics and supply chain activities, including transportation, warehousing, packaging, and distribution.\nA Handysize ship is a small to medium-sized bulk carrier designed for transporting various cargo types, capable of navigating smaller ports and shallow waters.\nGear used to do inland transportation of a container. This can include tools and apparatus used to load/discharge the container onto the intermodal type.\nSpecifications for a haulier set by a carrier in regards to a specific work order, e.g. timeline, capabilities.\nThe joint term for merchant and carrier haulage. It should be noted that a shipment can have several types of haulage throughout the transport from origin to destination.\nA haulier, also known as a trucking company or a carrier, is a business or individual that transports goods by road using trucks or lorries. Hauliers play a vital role in the transportation industry, moving goods between locations such as warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, ports, and retail stores. \nA House Bill of Lading (HBL) is a transportation document issued by a freight forwarder or Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier and includes details such as the type, quantity, and destination of the goods being transported. \nIn supply chain logistics, a hub and spoke model refers to a system where goods or services are transported through a central hub to various spoke locations. The hub acts as a central point for collection, sorting, and distribution, while the spokes represent the routes connecting the hub to different destinations.\nGlobal Port Congestion: H1 2024 in Review\nThe second quarter of 2024 saw worsening port congestion levels worldwide, particularly at Southeast Asia and European ports. This data underscores the ongoing impact of the Red Sea crisis and surging container shipping demand, which continue to put pressure on supply chains. \nNorth American Port Congestion: Struggles in Charleston, Stability on the West Coast \nOur port congestion index reveals the Port of Charleston experienced a staggering 132.36% increase in congestion, with average combined anchor and berth times jumping from 1.39 days across Q1 to 3.23 days in Q2. \nWhile Charleston struggled, other North American ports generally maintained stable congestion levels. Vancouver, despite remaining among the top five most congested ports globally, managed to reduce average congestion times by 1.44 days compared to Q1. Los Angeles also held steady, demonstrating resilience amidst high demand. This trend is encouraging for the persistently congested North American West Coast.\nElsewhere in North America, Houston and Oakland reduced congestion times by 1.5 and 1.0 days, respectively.\nAsian Port Congestion: A Mixed Bag\nIn Southeast Asia, 64% of analyzed ports saw rising congestion. Manila reported the most significant increase, adding nearly 20 hours to average anchor and berth times. Chittagong (Bangladesh), Port Kelang (Malaysia) and Singapore also reported large increases in congestion levels. \nConversely, East Asia has shown remarkable resilience. Only four of 26 analyzed ports reported increased average congestion in Q2. Ningbo-Zhoushan, however, saw congestion rise by 17.7% despite a strong month-on-month improvement in June. \nEuropean Port Congestion: Increases Across the Board\nIn Europe, 12 of 18 surveyed ports experienced increased congestion, though only Antwerp and Valencia saw deteriorations exceeding five hours. St Petersburg reported the largest decrease in congestion with a reduction of 1.39 days despite still having the highest H1 average at 2.54 days.\u00c2\u00a0\nPorts Reporting the Largest Congestion Increases (Q2 vs. Q1)\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Country\n\u00a0Region\n\u00a0Q1 Avg\n(days)\n\u00a0Q2 Avg\n(days)\n\u00a0Change\n(days)\n\u00a0Change\n(%)\u00a0\n\u00a0Charleston\n\u00a0United States\n\u00a0North America (E)\n\u00a01.39\n\u00a03.23\n\u00a01.84\n\u00a0132.4%\n\u00a0Zhoushan\n\u00a0China\n\u00a0Asia (NE)\n\u00a05.61\n\u00a06.60\n\u00a00.99\n\u00a017.7%\n\u00a0Jebel Ali\n\u00a0United Arab Emirates\n\u00a0MENA\n\u00a02.29\n\u00a03.16\n\u00a00.87\n\u00a038.0%\n\u00a0Manila\n\u00a0Philippines\n\u00a0Asia (SE)\n\u00a01.90\n\u00a02.72\n\u00a00.82\n\u00a043.3%\n\u00a0Chittagong\n\u00a0Bangladesh\n\u00a0Asia (S)\n\u00a03.01\n\u00a03.80\n\u00a00.79\n\u00a026.2%\nPorts Reporting the Largest Congestion Reductions (Q2 vs. Q1) \n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Country\n\u00a0Region\n\u00a0Q1 Avg\n(days)\n\u00a0Q2 Avg\n(days)\n\u00a0Change\n(days)\n\u00a0Change\n(days)\u00a0\n\u00a0Vancouver\n\u00a0Canada\n\u00a0North America (W)\n\u00a05.1\n\u00a03.5\n\u00a0-1.6\n\u00a0-32.0%\n\u00a0Houston\n\u00a0United States\n\u00a0North America (E)\n\u00a04.0\n\u00a02.5\n\u00a0-1.5\n\u00a0-37.8%\n\u00a0Oakland\n\u00a0United States\n\u00a0North America (W)\n\u00a02.8\n\u00a01.8\n\u00a0-1.0\n\u00a0-35.9%\n\u00a0St Petersburg\n\u00a0Russia\n\u00a0Europe (N)\n\u00a03.0\n\u00a02.1\n\u00a0-1.0\n\u00a0-32.1%\n\u00a0Quanzhou\n\u00a0China\n\u00a0Asia (NE)\n\u00a01.0\n\u00a00.4\n\u00a0-0.6\n\u00a0-58.4%\nDownload the latest port congestion statistics \nContinue reading\nIn Numbers: The Impact of the Red Sea Crisis on European & Asian Port Congestion\nWebinar Recap: Enhancing Supply Chain Collaboration Through Visibility\nThe Busiest Container Ports in the World\nSubscribe for the latest in supply chain technology.\n"

      "\n\nArticles\n\n\nNew Construction Activity Slows in September, Primarily in Multi-Family Space\nSeptember 2024 New Residential Construction\n\u00a0\nWhat happened\nNew residential construction retreated slightly in September following a strong August. The number of units permitted for construction fell to 1,428,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, a decrease of 2.9% from the previous month and 5.7% from the previous year. Housing starts slowed as well, falling 0.5% from August 2024 and 0.7% from September 2023. Completions dipped by 2.7% month-over-month, but remain up by 14.6% year-over-year. After leading the surge in August, multi-family projects dragged in September. Permits fell 10.8% month-over-month and 17.4% year-over-year, starts fell 4.5% month-over-month and 15.7% year-over-year, and completions fell 8.7% month-over-month though they remain elevated from 2023 figures. After 14 months of consecutive declines in median asking rent, builders seem to be responding to the market and shifting their focus to single-family construction. \n\n\u00a0\nWhere it happened\nThis month\u2019s data contains some eye-popping regional splits, mostly in the Northeast, which this team of economists suggests should be taken with a grain of salt. Housing starts in the Northeast are up 57.9% month-over-month and 109.3% year-over-year for September, the same month in which the region\u2019s first snowfall occurred. Completions too were up 55.6% month-over-month and 92.2% year-over-year on a seasonally adjusted annual basis. Blips in the raw data during off-peak months of the year in regions with a high degree of seasonality, like the Northeast, can skew the adjusted figures that are primarily reported. We will be interested to see how next month\u2019s revisions of the September data come in.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the majority (51.0%) of newly-built homes hitting the market are still in the South, where September completions fell 21.6% from the spike month in August, but still exceed September of last year by 3.1%. The West region had a strong month in terms of housing completions, beating August by 22.1% and last September by 25.3%. On a permitting basis, the South also dominates in terms of future construction, constituting 53.6% of permits issued nationally. Southern states make up most of the top 10 states for new construction highlighted in our New Construction Insights Report, and it appears that trend will continue.\nWhat does this mean for homebuyers, sellers, homeowners, and the housing market\nProspective homebuyers are facing major affordability challenges, with mortgage rates ticking back up into the mid-6% range and listing prices remaining stubbornly high. Though the bottom-line new construction figures for September 2024 are somewhat disappointing, single-family projects specifically had a more promising month. Single-family permits and starts were up from even a strong August, and single-family completions still exceeded September 2023. Builders are increasingly bringing smaller, more affordable homes to the market, so buyers may find more newly-built homes that fit their budget in the coming years if the pace of new construction continues.\nSign up for updates\nJoin our mailing list to receive the latest data and research.\n\n\n"

FIGURE 1: BMPO BASELINE PROJECTS (2022, 2035, 2050) 2 BMPO HCRS Methods and Assumptions Memo, March 2023 HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 3 The future traffic conditions of the BMPO area were forecasted based on the demographic projections and baseline network assumptions presented in Baseline Conditions Memorandum. The needs analysis focused on the year 2050 Baseline Conditions. To identify levels of congestion and network constraints, estimate traffic Level of Service (LOS) was used to compare the daily traffic volumes to the roadway capacity, based on roadway type and number of lanes. The 2050 Baseline BMPO model LOS and estimated Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes are summarized in Figure 2. FIGURE 2: 2050 BASELINE LOS AND ADT As shown in Figure 2, the BMPO Area is expected to experience increased congestion in the future, even with assumed significant investment in expanding and adding to existing roadways. System wide, drivers in the BMPO Area are forecasted to experience 82% more delay per trip by the year 2050. HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 4 The BMPO Area system wide levels of congested roadway, LOS E (at capacity) and LOS F (over capacity) are summarized by lane miles in Table 1. TABLE 1: CONGESTED LANE MILES SUMMARY YEAR % LANE MILES LOS E % LANE MILES LOS F % LANE MILES DEFICIENT (LOS E AND F) 2022 2.6% 1.9% 4.5% 2050 8.3% 6.9% 15.2% As shown in Table 1, by the year 2050 the total miles of congested roadway within the BMPO area roadway system is estimated to more than triple, despite the improvements assumed in the 2050 Baseline Scenario to include the projects in the LRTP. The primary areas of need identified in the Baseline Needs analysis include: \u2022 Existing and future congestion on segments of critical arterial corridors such as: o 17th Street (both existing and future conditions) o Ammon Road (both existing and future conditions) o Iona Road (both existing and future conditions) o 5th East (both existing and future conditions) o Lincoln Road (future conditions) o 25th East (future conditions) o Sunnyside Road (future conditions) o 5th West (future conditions) \u2022 Constrained East-West river crossings, including 2050 daily traffic demand projected to increase by 94% over present-day conditions, include: o Broadway (LOS D) o Pancheri (LOS F) o Sunnyside (LOS E) o 65th S (LOS D with assumed widening of the existing bridge to double capacity) \u2022 The Sunnyside Road/I-15 Interchange \u2013 trips using the interchange are expected to increase from 17,000 to 45,000 per day by the year 2050. This increase includes the baseline assumption that the 65th S bridge is widened. Without this project, Sunnyside Interchange traffic would increase even more. \u2022 Traffic growth on rural roads towards the foothills to the East, including the rural segments of Sunnyside Road, 17th Street 45th East, Ammon Road, and 65th South are expected to exceed capacity due to the growth projected in the southern portion of the BMPO Area. PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEEDS STATEMENT The roadway congestion needs identified in the Future Baseline Evaluation were combined with other identified needs including safety, access, and active transportation themes from the most HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 5 recent BMPO LRTP to create the High-Capacity Roadway Study (HCRS) Needs Statement, as follows: \u201cLack of safe, efficient, and equitable access for all modes of travel from new growth areas within the BMPO area to regional activity centers and highway facilities, with increasing pass-through travel on congested arterial corridors.\u201d Based on the study needs statement, the HCRS Purpose Statement was then defined as follows: \u201cProactively plan and develop comprehensive multi-modal high-capacity roadway corridors and supporting connections, optimizing future transportation investments to help alleviate traffic congestion on existing arterial corridors and enhance overall regional mobility.\u201d Both the Purpose and Need Statements establish the approach to the alternatives development process. PUBLIC OUTREACH SUMMARY The Exiting and Future Baseline system evaluation results and study Purpose and Need Statement were shared with the Public in an Open House event on November 14, 2023. Public feedback from this event identified the following additional key themes: \u2022 Lack of active transportation facilities \u2022 Congestion on arterial corridors, particularly Ammon Road \u2022 Pass/Cut-thru traffic on local streets \u2022 Need for coordinated signal timing on arterials \u2022 Utility of roundabouts on arterials \u2022 Speeding on rural arterials \u2022 Need for beltway system to reduce congestion These needs were also considered where applicable to the project purpose statement during the subsequent alternatives screening and evaluation process. ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION The alternatives development and evaluation process followed four distinct steps: 1. Develop initial Expressway Alternatives 2. Fatal Flaw (Level 1) Screening of Expressway Alternatives (with the Steering Committee only or including elected officials?) Concern was expressed by elected officials in the last Joint TAC Police Board meeting giving indicators that we might have to go back to this step 3. Evaluation (Level 2) of Expressway Alternatives 4. Develop and Evaluate Strategic Arterial Alternatives HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 6 INITIAL EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVES An expressway is a limited access, median-separated, high speed (55 mph or more) facility. US 20 through Idaho Falls currently operates as an expressway facility. Expressways may include grade separations/interchanges, particularly in urbanized areas, but can also be full access at-grade intersections, albeit spaced at 1-mile minimum distances. An expressway will contain a minimum of two lanes per direction. The initial expressway alternatives were developed using a combination of ideas from the Steering Committee, project team, and the public, as well as concepts proposed in the \u201cIdaho Falls Arterial Loop: Economic Assessment\u201d and the \u201cTransportation System Alternatives Study.\u201d These expressway concepts were intended to serve future growth areas surrounding the currently urbanized BMPO areas while also providing higher speed, higher capacity alternatives to existing congested arterial corridors. Note that by nature of their proposed locations, the expressways would not be expected to provide significant relief to current congestion issues in the more fully built out areas within the BMPO, as the new facilities would be too far out of direction to pull trips from these roadways. The expressway alternatives were intended to provide both capacity for new development and increase resiliency of nearby congested arterials against future growth. The following initial Expressway Alternatives were proposed for Level 1 Screening (See Figure 3): \u2022 North Concept o North Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 New Expressway located approximately on the 81st North Alignment, from I-15 to US 26. This concept would include a new interchange on I-15 and a new Snake River crossing. \u2022 South Concepts o South Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 New Expressway located approximately along the 65th South existing alignment, from I-15 to 45th East (Crowley). This concept would involve re-aligning the 65th South Corridor between 15th East and 25th East. o South Expressway Alternative 2 \u2013 New Expressway located approximately halfway between 65th South and 81st South, connecting I-15 to 45th East (Crowley). This alternative would follow the 65th South existing alignment from I-15 through US 91. o South Expressway Alternative 3 \u2013 New Expressway located approximately along the 65th South existing alignment, but routing to the north-east at 25th East, ultimately connecting to 45th East (Crowley) near Sunnyside Road. This concept is identical to South Expressway Alternative 1 from I-15 to 25th East. \u2022 East o East Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 New Expressway located approximately \u00bc mile east of 55th East, from just north of the 65th South/45th East (Crowley) intersection to the US 26/55th East intersection. \u2022 West o West Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 New Expressway connecting the planned I-15/US 20 Connector system interchange to the I-15/45th West/65th South interchange. This alignment would approximately follow the existing 45th West alignment from 17th North to 65th South. HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 7 Note that these initial concepts were very high-level planning alignments, and more specific details related to the alignment locations and geometry were saved for alternatives passing the subsequent Level 1 (Fatal Flaw) Screening. FIGURE 3: INITIAL EXPRESSWAY CONCEPTS HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 8 Two additional alternatives were considered and dismissed based on clear feasibility constraints: \u2022 45th East Expressway (65th S to US 26) \u2013 the existing land use, constrained ROW, and access conditions on this corridor led to this alternative being deemed infeasible by the Stakeholder Committee \u2022 55th East Expressway (45th E near 65th S to US 26) \u2013 similar to 45th East, the constrained ROW, and access conditions on this corridor led to this alternative being deemed infeasible by the Stakeholder Committee EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVES LEVEL 1 SCREENING The HCRS Streeting Committee performed the Level 1 (Fatal Flaw) Screening of the initial expressway alternatives. The key Level 1 Screening Criteria considered were: \u2022 Physical Constraints \u2013 consideration of prohibitive terrain features such as steep grades \u2022 Traffic Utility \u2013 consideration of the project purpose and need related to identified congestion needs \u2022 ROW/property Impacts \u2013 Potential to create large scale property acquisitions in already built out neighborhoods and subdivisions \u2022 Access Impacts \u2013 existing roadway and driveway access for expressway alignments following current roadway corridors Using these criteria, the Steering Committee screened out the following expressway alternatives: \u2022 North Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 This concept was screened out due to minimal anticipated traffic utility towards the HCRS Purpose and Need. Under 2050 Baseline Conditions, the I-15 to US 20 Connector project provides surplus capacity for east-west traffic in this area, and the proposed expressway corridor would not be targeting any clear needs. In addition, the ROW impacts along 81st N and the feasibility of constructing another system level interchange on I-15 were determining factors in screening out this alternative. \u2022 South Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 This alternative was screened out due to access impacts along the existing 65th South corridor, which includes many driveways and already abuts housing subdivision connections. \u2022 South Expressway Alternative 3 \u2013 This alternative was also screened out due to access impacts along the existing 65th South corridor as well as conflicts with subdivisions when connecting from 65th south across Ammon Road and onto 49th East (Crowley) \u2022 East Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 This alternative was screened out due to property impacts and grade constraints for the segment from 45th East to the proposed north-south alignment, particularly conflicts at Sunnyside Road The remaining Expressway Alternatives (South Expressway Alternative 2 and West Expressway Alternative 1) were advanced to the Level 2 Evaluation. EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVES LEVEL 2 EVALUATION The two expressway alternatives advanced to the Level 2 Evaluation (South Alt 2 and West Alt 1) were analyzed in the 2050 BMPO travel demand model to estimate the potential traffic benefits and independent utility of these proposed corridors. Each corridor was also evaluated to determine the HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 9 high-level key design constraints and potential ROW, access, and design challenges that the proposed expressway would likely entail. WEST EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION The West Expressway Alignment was refined to include curves that met AASHTO standards for the anticipated speeds (55 mph) of the new facility. The northern terminus of the proposed expressway was connected to the yet to be constructed I-15/US 20 Connector as the fourth leg of the system interchange. At the southern terminus, the expressway follows the 45th W alignment into the 65th S/I-15 interchange. The West Expressway Alternative was added to the BMPO 2050 Baseline network and run as an independent scenario under 2050 conditions. As this was a high-level evaluation of the viability of this proposed expressway, the initial coding assumptions emphasized capacity, speed, and throughput. These coding assumptions do not represent the likely expressway configuration but do portray the ability of the proposed facility to draw trips away from other congested corridors. The arterial intersections with the proposed expressway were either modeled as grade separations (overpass/underpass) or interchanges, described as follows: \u2022 Old Butte Rd/N 26th W \u2013 Coded as an overpass/underpass \u2022 35th W \u2013 Coded as an interchange \u2022 57th W \u2013 Coded as an overpass/underpass \u2022 W 17th N \u2013 Coded as an interchange \u2022 US 20 \u2013 Coded as an interchange \u2022 17th Street S \u2013 Coded as an overpass/underpass \u2022 W 33rd S \u2013 Coded as an interchange \u2022 W 49th S \u2013 Coded as an overpass/underpass To better understand the traffic benefits of the West Expressway Alternative, the change in daily traffic volume between the year 2050 West Expressway Alternative and the Baseline Scenario was mapped and analyzed (See Figure 4). HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 10 FIGURE 4: WEST EXPRESSWAY VS BASELINE 2050 TRAFFIC VOLUME CHANGE As shown in Figure 4, the West Expressway draws traffic away from the I-15 and US 20 West, reducing daily traffic on these corridors by up to 15%. The expressway essentially provides a US 20 bypass around Idaho Falls. The expressway also pulls traffic away from the congested I-15/Sunnyside Road interchange, reducing traffic at this location by 5%. Additional localized increases on roadways such as 33rd S, 49th S, and Broadway are driven be assumed reduced access HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 11 to the 45th West corridor, which would then reallocate trips to these east-west corridors. Overall, these reallocated future trips are not expected to create significant capacity issues on these east-west corridors. The West Expressway 2050 BMPO model LOS and estimated Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes are summarized in Figure 5 (without the South Expressway Alternative). FIGURE 5: 2050 WEST EXPRESSWAY LOS AND ADT As shown in Figure 5, the West Expressway does not directly address any of the critical 2050 Baseline LOS issues. This proposed expressway does provide significant regional route redundancy by providing an alternate US 20 route, and also provides additional capacity to support growth west of the Snake River. HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 12 A high-level assessment of the corridor for expressway feasibility indicated the challenges summarized in Table 2. TABLE 2: WEST EXPRESSWAY KEY CHALLENGES CHALLENGE SEGMENT POTENTIAL MITIGATIONS PRIVATE DRIVEWAYS 65th S to 49th S Shift expressway alignment west of 45th W \u00bd Mile south of US 20 Shift expressway alignment slightly west, extend old S 45th Rd W alignment south as a frontage connection CONSTRAINED ROW 17th S/45th W Consider shifting alignment east to bypass existing privates and commercial structures NEW ROW NEEDED 17th N to I-15/US 20 Connector Interchange Refine alignment for this corridor to provide basis for ROW buffer, ensuing future development does not build over the proposed corridor 17th N to 65th S Ensure incoming development along 45th W leaves sufficient ROW setbacks to accommodate an expressway cross section 65th S/I-15 Interchange ROW needs for potential system interchange SOUTH EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION The South Expressway Alignment was refined to include curves that met AASHTO standards for the anticipated speeds (55 mph) of the new facility. The western terminus of the proposed expressway follows the existing 65th S alignment and connects into the 65th S/I-15 interchange. At the eastern terminus, the expressway ties into 45th E (Crowley). The South Expressway Alternative was added to the BMPO 2050 Baseline network and run as an independent scenario under 2050 conditions. As this was a high-level evaluation of the viability of this proposed expressway, similar to the West Expressway, the initial coding assumptions emphasized capacity, speed, and throughput. These coding assumptions do not represent the likely expressway configuration but do portray the ability of the proposed facility to draw trips away from other congested corridors. The arterial intersections with the proposed expressway were either modeled as grade separations (overpass/underpass) or interchanges, described as follows: \u2022 1600 Rd/81 S \u2013 Overpass/Underpass \u2022 US 91 \u2013 Interchange \u2022 Jameston Rd \u2013 Overpass/Underpass \u2022 5th W \u2013 Overpass/Underpass \u2022 5th E (Holmes) \u2013 Interchange HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 13 \u2022 15th E \u2013 Overpass/Underpass \u2022 25th E \u2013 Interchange \u2022 Ammon Rd \u2013 Overpass/Underpass In addition, the 65th S/I-15 interchange capacity was assumed to be expanded as part of the South Expressway Alternative, with the existing roundabouts widened to multi-lane and the existing overpass expanded to four lanes. To better understand the traffic benefits of the South Expressway Alternative, both South Expressway Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 were evaluated. South Expressway Alternative 1 was modeled to determine whether shifting the expressway further south significantly decreased the traffic benefits. In addition, the West Expressway Alternative was included with both South Expressway Scenarios to better understand the traffic impacts at the 65th S/I-15 interchange. The change in daily traffic volume between the year 2050 South Expressway Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the Baseline Scenario are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 14 FIGURE 6: SOUTH EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVE 1 VS BASELINE 2050 TRAFFIC VOLUME CHANGE HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 15 FIGURE 7: SOUTH EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVE 2 VS BASELINE 2050 TRAFFIC VOLUME CHANGE HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 16 As shown in both figures, the south expressway pulls traffic off multiple congested corridors, reducing 2050 traffic demand on Sunnyside Road by approximately 12%, and on 17th Street by approximately 8%. Based on these findings, shifting the south expressway approximately \u00bd mile south of 65th S was determined to provide similar traffic benefits to the expressway alternative on the existing 65th S alignment. Note that there are additional shifts of north-south traffic between parallel corridors. These shifts are driven by the modeled access points from arterials onto the expressway, and result in some small north-south traffic shifts farther from the expressway, such as on to Woodruff north of 25th S. The South Expressway 2050 BMPO model LOS and estimated Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes are summarized in Figure 8. FIGURE 8: 2050 SOUTH EXPRESSWAY LOS AND ADT HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 17 As shown in Figure 8, the South Expressway reduces future congestion on Sunnyside Road, reducing travel time on this corridor by more than 12%, and on 17th Street by more than 7%. In addition, this alternative reduces traffic demand on the 65th S corridor. A high-level assessment of the corridor for expressway feasibility indicated the challenges summarized in Table 3.

Strategic arterials would be five to seven lane roadways, with access limited to \u00bd mile intersection spacing. Intersections could be HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 18 signal or roundabout controlled, with roundabout control working particularly well in locations where eliminating access points, particularly existing driveways, is not feasible. The initial strategic arterials proposed for consideration are shown in Figure 9. FIGURE 9: PROPOSED STRATEGIC ARTERIALS HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 19 The strategic arterials were added to the BMPO 2050 Baseline network and run as an independent scenario under 2050 conditions without expressways. The coding of the proposed corridors consisted of removing/revising centroid connections (neighborhood access) onto the proposed strategic arterials. These changes reflected potential access restrictions along the corridors. Corridor speeds were also increased to reflect reduced intersection impedance. Note that the strategic arterials were first tested independently from the expressways to understand their utility, but the ultimate goal is to have the strategic arterials combined with expressways to serve future traffic needs. To better understand the traffic benefits of the Strategic Arterials, the change in daily traffic volume between the year 2050 Strategic Arterials Alternative and the Baseline Scenario was mapped and analyzed (See Figure 10). HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 20 FIGURE 10: STRATEGIC ARTERIAL ALTERNATIVE VS BASELINE 2050 TRAFFIC VOLUME CHANGE The strategic arterial corridors draw traffic demand from parallel corridors, with 65th S, Lincoln Rd, 25th E, and 45th E in particular drawing additional traffic demand and providing some relief to adjacent corridors such as Ammon Road (up to 13% reduction) and 1st St (up to 12% reduction). The Strategic Arterial 2050 BMPO model LOS and estimated Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes are summarized in Figure 11. HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 21 FIGURE 11: 2050 STRATEGIC ARTERIAL LOS AND ADT As shown in Figure 11, the Strategic Arterial Alternative improves travel times on the following routes: \u2022 65th S (east of US 91) \u2022 35th W \u2022 45th E HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 22 \u2022 49th S \u2022 45th N Overall, the strategic arterials provide system wide benefit, and that benefit is further augmented when coupled with the south expressway. A high-level assessment of the corridors for strategic arterial feasibility indicated the following key challenges: \u2022 65th S Corridor Challenges o Driveway access \u2013 numerous private driveways, particularly between Ammon Road and 45th E o Local subdivision access, including > Maggie Dr > 9 W > S 9th W > S 12th W > Limousin Ave > Glass Mountain Blvd > Sommer Dr o Land Use \u2013 Fairgrounds o Geometry \u2013 offset intersection at 25th E \u2022 Sunnyside Road Corridor Challenges o Local road access, particularly east of 25th E o Constrained ROW \u2013 East of 25th E o Existing private driveway access \u2022 Lincoln Road Corridor Challenges o Unknown future tie-in to existing US 20 corridor o Commercial Access points west of 25th E o Private driveway access from 25th E to Ammon Rd \u2022 49th N Corridor Challenges o Need to coordinate with ITD US 26 corridor project, particularly at Beaches Corner o Private driveways from Ammon Rd to 45th E \u2022 33rd N Corridor Challenges o Private driveway access near 26th W/Old Butte Rd \u2022 45th W Corridor Challenges o Private driveway access south of 49th S, near 17th S, south of US 20 \u2022 25th E Corridor Challenges o Commercial access near Iona Road and US 26 o Private accesses north of US 26 \u2022 45th E Corridor Challenges HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 23 o Limited ROW/canal conflicts, particularly north of Lincoln Rd o Private drive access, particularly for \u00bd mile south of Iona Rd INITIAL HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY SYSTEM The West Expressway was initially recommended for inclusion as an opportunity to provide long-term (30+ year) capacity for growth west of I-15. Based on this recommendation, 45th W and 33rd N were not initially recommended as strategic arterials. The South Expressway was initially recommended for inclusion in the high-capacity roadway system due to both the 25-year benefits to adjacent corridors such as Sunnyside and 65th S as well as the potential to serve larger future growth needs as the urbanized areas continue to extend to the south. Due to the South Expressway recommendation, 65th S was not initially recommended as a strategic arterial, but rather was recommended to become a minor arterial with a 3-lane cross section. The Old Butte Road Corridor was recommended for inclusion as a strategic arterial as this corridor completes an inner loop connection and provides support for the more near-term development likely to occur west of the Snake River. All other proposed strategic arterials corridors were included in the initial recommended high-capacity roadway system. In addition, 5th W (Freeman Rd/E River Rd) north of US 20 showed capacity issues under 2050 conditions, and is recommended to be upgraded from a Minor Arterial to a Major Arterial from US 20 to 65th N. The full initial recommended scenario is shown in Figure 12.

The change in daily traffic volume between the year 2050 Initial High-Capacity Roadway and the Baseline Scenario was mapped along with the ADT and LOS (See Figure 13 and Figure 14).

Key system performance metrics are summarized in Table 4.

These corridors do have opportunities for additional capacity enhancement, particularly with coordinated signal timings on the signalized corridors, and widening on to existing five-lane segments at key locations. These proposed corridors will help keep the regional traffic movements off the local system, enhancing opportunities for parallel low stress active transportation corridors, reduce the risk of neighborhood cut-through traffic attempting to bypass arterial congestion, and provide opportunities for safer transit access. Additional evaluation at the corridor level considered the traffic operations benefits of limiting future access to the strategic arterial corridors as the surrounding areas develop and build out. These benefits were estimated based on the proportion of each corridor currently undeveloped, and the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) travel time and segment density (congestion) reductions associated with reduced access. Existing corridors surrounded by more built out adjacent land uses realize less future benefit, as many of the access decisions on the urban segments of these corridors have already been made.

To accommodate this increased traffic, the 5th W classification is recommended to be upgraded to Principal Arterial, and a new project should be considered to widen this corridor to five lanes from the existing five-lane section near MK Simpson Blvd to 65th N. This improvement should be coordinated with the I-15/US 20 Connector project. The initial findings and recommendations from the evaluation of alternatives were shared with the local jurisdiction staff and elected representatives. Further input was received regarding ROW constraints, expressway viability, and needed connections, and this input was used to develop the Final Recommended High-Capacity Roadway Network. FINAL HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY NETWORK The input received from local jurisdictions throughout the BMPA indicated ROW and land use constraints that rendered the West Expressway alternative inviable. Therefore, the 45th W and 33rd N Strategic Arterials were added back into the High-Capacity Roadway system as part of the final recommendation. The key benefits and future project considerations for these corridors are summarized as follows: \u2022 45th W Strategic Arterial Re-classification o Benefits > Potential 25% decrease in future travel time > Improved corridor safety (reduced conflicts) > Reduced intra-city travel on I-15 o Future project considerations > Plan for future interchange at US 20/45th W \u2022 33rd N Strategic Arterial Re-classification o Benefits > Potential 5% decrease in future travel time > Improved corridor safety (reduced conflicts) > Reduced traffic demand US 20 (I-15 to 45th W) \u2022 Future project considerations o If the I-15 to US 20 connector contains a full access west side connection at I-15, ensure that this access connects to 33rd W Additional adjustments were made to the reclassification recommendations for the other strategic arterial corridors, ensuring all strategic arterials start and end at either equal or higher classification facilities. The South Expressway concept was further refined, with a preliminary alignment and initial interchange footprint concepts added to develop an estimated range of potential impact for the corridor.

      "The Causes of Traffic and Congestion\nThere are many misconceptions in my local conversation about what does or does not induce motor traffic. Some of these misconceptions are:\nSingle family homes do not increase traffic. If all we build are single-family homes, this will forever stay a quiet neighborhood.\nCommercial development does not increase traffic, because it does not add more residents.\nCongestion is bad, and we should treat avoiding it as a priority.\nLet's dive into it: traffic, what causes it, and what we can do about it.\nThe Role of the Street Network\nHierarchy of roads. (Source: Wikipedia)\nThe largest contributor to congestion is the hierarchical road network. This is where you have local streets feed into collectors that feed into arterials that feed into highways.\nThe Strong Towns article on Dealing with Congestion explains why this is bad. We are funneling all traffic through a small number of streets, giving us a lower vehicle capacity as well as fewer redundancies for when things go wrong (creating a fragile road network where one clog can grind traffic to a halt), and artificially spaces things out by reducing what you can reach in a given distance (sometimes stupidly so as in the case where two houses share a backyard despite their front doors being 7 miles apart).\nA highly connected street network (this can mean a grid, but can also take non-geometric forms such as the street network of a medieval city) is better because there are a ton of redundancies (a street closure does not matter if you have countless alternative routes from A to B) and distances are shorter as you can take a more direct route from A to B. Because the load is distributed over the many redundancies, we are no longer funneling all of the traffic over a small handful of collectors or arterials, so you are going to encounter less traffic along your way, even if all else (population density, amount of travel) remains equal.\nI took this photo of the crowd at the train station just outside of the MetLife Stadium while waiting in a crowd myself trying to just get outside. No matter how frequently the train comes, attempting to funnel all of these people through a single point is going to feel extremely crowded.\nDesignating a main thoroughfare, with higher speed and greater capacity, to funnel traffic through is bad, even if it is part of a street grid. This thoroughfare will attract all of the traffic until it is so congested that it no longer offers a speed advantage over alternative routes (such as parallel side streets), and all people will do is complain how congested it is. This holds true any time we deal with funneling a flow: getting all cars to take the same road, asking all spectators to leave through the same stadium door after a sports game, making all travelers at the airport to go through a single security line, pushing all commuters onto a single transit line, getting all permit approvals to flow through a single queue, and so on. It does not take many people for it to feel crowded when everyone is concentrated in one place.\nThe Role of Land Use\nLet's look at land use. It is true that not having anything will attract no traffic (there is nobody living there and nowhere to go, so there will be no traffic), thus building anything will increase traffic. But the correlation between the amount of activity in a place (residences, businesses, and other destinations) and the traffic it produces is not linear.\nThe trick comes down to building complete neighborhoods. A complete neighborhood is one where you can get most of your needs within walking distance. Transitioning to a complete neighborhood reduces motor traffic because of import replacement.\nImport replacement refers to the practice of replacing a good or service that you used to get elsewhere with a local good or service. Import replacement takes many forms. The word \u2018import\u2019 makes me think of foreign trade, so the first thing that comes to mind when I hear \u2018import replacement\u2019 is replacing imported washing machines from China with domestic washing machines. However, import replacement can occur at different levels (all the way down to the neighborhood), and can refer to the replacement of non-physical goods. For example, a small town might not have its own advertising agency, so local businesses have to use the services of an advertising agency in a larger city. But, as that small town grows, it is likely that local businesses (such as advertising agencies, law firms, doctors\u2019 clinics, building contractors, shops, and restaurants) will emerge and residents can avoid traveling to the next town over.\nLet\u2019s look at a specific example. If a city does not have a Mexican restaurant, its residents, if they want Mexican food, are required to travel 20 miles to the next town. But, Mexican food is popular so the residents make the trek. The city decides to open its own Mexican restaurant. Now, if you want Mexican food you only have to make a 2 mile trip instead of a 20 mile trip. So, you could argue there are more cars in the city (since the cars are not leaving for the next town over), but you are going to encounter less traffic for two reasons:\nYou are only traveling 2 miles and not 20 miles, so you\u2019re going to spend less time in your car and dealing with traffic.\nIf your town has some form of a highly-connected street network (such as a street grid or an organic mesh), it will better distribute the load of traffic than funneling everyone through a few regional connections between the cities.\nLet\u2019s go one step further. If a Mexican restaurant opens 3 blocks from where we live, do we even need a vehicle (car or transit) to get to the Mexican restaurant? Would it not be easier just to walk or ride a bike? And save dealing with parking or waiting for the bus/train for those longer trips?\nI love Strong Towns\u2019s party analogy. Imagine that you are hosting a party outdoors at a park. Everyone who attends is required to bring more food or drink than they consume. If someone showed up, you would say, \u201cCome on in!\u201d because the more people, the more food, the better the party. This is a Good Party. Now imagine the opposite. You are providing the food and drink, the more people who show up, the less there is to go around (or the more you are spending). If someone unexpected shows up, you would send them away, because the more people, the worse the party. This is a Bad Party. A Good Party gets better with more people. A Bad Party gets worse with more people.\nIn terms of traffic, if you keep your land uses segregated, especially at car-scales, with your residents in one area and your businesses in another area, the more people you add, the more traffic there will be as more people travel between the two sides. This is a Bad Party. You do not want more people. You do not want more traffic.\nOn the other hand, if your city allows a mixture of uses within neighborhoods, then the more people who show up, the more likely it is that you will get that Mexican restaurant 3 blocks from you, as well as other amenities. This is a Good Party. The more the merrier.\nSeveral years ago I made a Zoning and Traffic simulator where I measured the effect of traffic and land uses. My take away from that is:\n1. Separating land uses generates congestion.\n2. Cities have a tendency to order themselves so that the most dense stuff is in the middle, and the least dense stuff is around the outside, and this results in less congestion and shorter average commute times.\n3. A heuristic approach (letting the free market optimize itself through trial and error) works quite well, and can cut commute times in half and results in less congestion. If this fails and you end up with randomized land use, then you end up with slightly shorter commute times and significantly less congestion than segregating land uses anyway.\nThe Role of Density\nHoboken\u2019s Washington Street. Monday, at 5:45PM.\nBy building Complete Neighborhoods, we can approach high population densities with little motor traffic. For example, Hoboken, where I live, has a population of about 40,000 people per square mile, and yet even during rush hour, our main street, Washington Street, has very little traffic. There are still people who drive to work\u2014either they commute a long distance off the beaten path of transit or they are contractors who have a van full of tools\u2014but transit, walking, and cycling are serious modes of transportation only because we\u2019ve built and connected together complete neighborhoods.\nLet's look at an extreme case\u2014Manhattan\u2014which is an island of complete neighborhoods (some of which reach population densities up to about 151,000 people per square mile). Cars only account for 6% of trips in Manhattan (this number from NYCDOT excludes the northern area of Manhattan above Central Park). I am not under the illusion that Manhattan has no motor traffic or that by doing everything right you can eliminate all traffic. But observing traffic in Manhattan, I notice several interesting properties:\nA typical residential street does not have that much traffic.\nWhen there is traffic, at least half of the non-parked vehicles are commercial vehicles (cars with Uber stickers on their window, taxis, buses, garbage trucks, delivery vans, etc.)\nTraffic seems to be the heaviest when it gets concentrated on designated thoroughfares such as 11th Avenue.\nTraffic lights create an illusion of congestion because they create synchronization barriers that cause vehicles otherwise spaced apart to cluster together (and then continue on travelling as a cluster). I don't like traffic lights.\nVideo of the traffic at the intersection of Manhattan's 10th Avenue and 23rd Street at lunch. Not bad for a neighborhood of 145,000 people per square mile.\nOne thing we can say with a high degree of certainty is that if Manhattan did not have a subway system or was not made up of complete neighborhoods, traffic would be far worse if we had an additional 5.6 million daily car commuters on the street, not to mention all the small trips done on foot (such as walking to the doctor, shopping, or going out to eat) that would be otherwise done in a car. Once you reach this point where Manhattan is today, there is not much you can do, in regards to the development pattern, to reduce traffic. But the vast majority of American cities are not at this point.\nAnother way we can work to reduce vehicular traffic is to simultaneously disincentivize driving by taking away space from cars (travel lanes, parking) or congestion pricing, while incentivizing other modes (expanding the transit system, expanding bike sharing, etc.) enough that these other modes become the more convenient choice.\nIs congestion really a problem?\nAt the end of the day, we should not worry too much about congestion or traffic. Congestion is part of the solution, not the problem. Congestion is feedback that we have built a place people want to be. The response to congestion should be to allow that Mexican restaurant to open up 3 blocks away rather than 2 miles away. To create bus lines and bike lanes that give people alternative ways to get around. The incorrect response to congestion is to build faster and wider streets, because that just reinforces car dependency and all of the negative consequences that come with it.\nTo summarize:\nDevelopment can add traffic. However, development that brings amenities and people closer together and reduces the need to travel so far can actually reduce traffic. With a mixture of uses, you can achieve a high population density with very little motor traffic.\nA highly-connected street network (either a street grid or organic) with many redundancies better distributes the load of traffic and is more resilient to disruptions.\nDesignated thoroughfares and bypasses create an illusion of traffic because they funnel the traffic through a single point (and with this comes the fragility of a single point of failure that can bring down the system).\nAttempting to address congestion with solutions that make it easier to drive can make the problem worse by continuing to make the car the preferred way to get around.\nWe should not worry too much about congestion, because it creates demand for other modes of transportation and for amenities to be closer.\nPart of why we can't agree on constructive solutions to traffic congestion is that our basic mental model of what causes traffic is wrong. But what if we made a slight update to that model?\nThese observations from a morning detour demonstrate why small neighborhood side streets are better than big, wide highways, even when it comes to moving traffic.\nNo, you\u2019re not stuck in congestion because your city\u2019s infrastructure is \u201cinadequate\u201d to handle growth.\nNot for the first time, the Car-pocalypse failed to materialize around Seattle\u2019s new SR-99 tunnel. This is further proof we\u2019ve been underestimating commuters\u2019 ability to adjust to transportation changes. Have we also been overestimating how much they value these multibillion-dollar megaprojects in the first place?\nFlawed methodology. Lack of accountability. Discrepant data. Egregious assumptions. The new Urban Mobility Report will be used to make or justify transportation policies around the country, which makes it too wrong to be ignored. \nLove to hate congestion? We\u2019ll never fix it by obsessing over speed or traffic delays. We need to rethink our whole transportation debate, starting with this premise: it\u2019s not about how fast you can go. It\u2019s about what you can get to.\nA deep, dredged ship canal is a recipe for catastrophic flooding in a hurricane, whereas a coastal marsh absorbs the surge of water in a way that lets life continue to flourish. This analogy has something important to teach us about urban streets.\nOnce a year, Ben & Jerry\u2019s gives away ice cream for free\u2014and people line up around the block because the price is so low. There\u2019s a lesson here about urban roads and congestion.\nWe\u2019ve gotten very good at keeping traffic off of neighborhood streets. But at what cost to our cities?\nWhen we obsess over the speed of travel\u2014whether in our cars or on public transit\u2014we\u2019re missing the point of transportation. It\u2019s not about how far you can get in a given time: it\u2019s what you can get to.\nAndrew Price (Twitter: @AndrewAPrice) has been a regular contributor to Strong Towns since 2013 and is a founding member of the organization.

Please let us know if you have feedback.\nDive Brief:\n\nTraffic congestion is greater today than in 2019 in all but six of the top 100 most populous metropolitan areas in the U.S., according to a report published this month from Streetlight Data.\nDespite hybrid and remote work trends, the number of vehicle miles traveled per capita was 12% higher in May 2024 than the same month in 2019.\nIn downtown areas, although vehicle miles traveled are lower in 18 of the 25 most highly populated cities, congestion is down in just eight of them, implying that \u201ccongestion is quite stubborn on these taxed urban roads,\u201d the report says.\n\nDive Insight:\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of daily vehicle miles traveled per capita was on an upward trend nationwide, the report says. Initially, amid stay-at-home orders and work-from-home policies, VMT dropped dramatically. But from its low in the spring of 2020, VMT across the U.S. climbed upward.\nVehicle miles traveled and traffic congestion can correlate with one another but not in all cases. Among the top 25 cities, five kept their VMT at or below 2019 levels but only San Francisco saw congestion slightly under its pre-pandemic mark.\u00a0Focusing on downtown areas \u2014 many of which are struggling with empty office buildings \u2014 the Streetlight Data report found just seven of the urban cores in the top 25 metropolitan areas experienced lower congestion than in 2019.\nNew York City\u2019s urban center saw both the largest rise in VMT\u00a0and in congestion,\u00a0even as office vacancy rates hover around 16% in Manhattan, according to the New York City comptroller. New York City would have become the first city in the U.S. to establish a congestion pricing program to address its traffic problem, but New York Gov. Kathy Hochul pulled the plug on the plan in June.\n\u201cWhile there was some hope that a new remote work culture might keep miles driven down and congestion at bay, StreetLight\u2019s results indicate that the status quo isn\u2019t working,\u201d the report says. \u201cA reliance on remote work is not a panacea to the rise in VMT and the default solution for traffic \u2014 adding roadway capacity \u2014 isn\u2019t solving congestion.\u201d\nRecommended Reading\n\nCongestion pricing alone won\u2019t solve New York\u2019s traffic problem By Ralf-Peter Sch\u00e4fer \u2022 Aug. 6, 2024\n\nMore housing, fewer offices: San Francisco mayor proposes zoning change By Ysabelle Kempe \u2022 July 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n purchase licensing rights\n\nFiled Under: Transportation\nSmart Cities Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\nEmail:    \n\nSelect user consent:  By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

      "Clean & Safe: New speed limits in Santa Monica prioritize roadway safety for all users\nAugust 29, 2024 7:59 AM\nSANTA MONICA, Calif. (Aug. 28, 2024) \u2013 Speed limits on more than 30 miles of Santa Monica streets will be lowered, following unanimous approval by the Santa Monica City Council on Tuesday.   \nThese reductions are the results of a speed survey conducted earlier this year to ensure the speed limits remain valid. The survey, conducted from Jan. 27 through Jul. 29, includes measurement of vehicular speeds along roadway segments to determine the speed of a majority of drivers, which is the most effective attribute in establishing speed limits.\n\nThe study recommended only one increase in speed limit, from 25 to 30 miles per hour, on a 0.3-mile segment of California Avenue. A full list of approved speed adjustments, recommended in consultation with the Santa Monica Police Department, is included below.  \nThe city will begin rolling out new signage exhibiting the updated speed limits this fall.  \nThe proposed speed limit changes support the city\u2019s Vision Zero goal of eliminating fatal and severe injury crashes on city streets by improving safety for all roadway users.   \nCouncil adopted Vision Zero in February 2016. Unsafe speed is the second most common violation cited in fatal and severe crashes in the city, at 14 percent of the total. Crashes at slower speeds are less likely to result in fatalities, and the application of reasonable and safe speed limits allows for effective enforcement of speed limits throughout the city.  \n \u201cReducing vehicle speeds on our roads is vital to create safer conditions for getting around in our city,\u201d Department of Transportation Director Anuj Gupta said. \u201cIt is one of the many ways Santa Monica is creating a street network that is more safe, connected and attractive for all roadway users.\u201d  \nThe ordinance will be adopted 30 days after the second reading, which is anticipated for Sept. 10.

Sensors along the roadway detect when congestion or weather conditions are dangerous. They then automatically reduce the speed limit (in at least 5-mph increments) to slow traffic evenly to allow smooth traffic flow, delay the onset of congestion, and avoid stop-and-go conditions. VSLs are also called speed harmonization and dynamic speed limits.\nContrary to what one may think, slowing traffic down in heavy traffic actually increases the number of cars that can travel on a road.\u00a0 The slower speeds make drivers more comfortable driving closer together and keep stop-and-go conditions to a minimum.\nDepending on the purpose of the system, speed limits can be mandatory or suggested. Changeable message signs can also be used with this system to give drivers travel-time information or other details.\nThe ideal system monitors data from roadway sensors and automatically adjusts speed limits when congestion reaches a certain amount. The speed limit is lowered to keep an even traffic flow at a speed that is reasonable with the traffic volume. This delays the start of stop-and-go conditions and reduces the number of rear-end collisions.\nTwo common purposes for using VSLs are for bad weather conditions and congestion management:\nIn both cases, the speed limit decrease is intended to alert drivers of conditions up ahead. Ideally, the speed limit and message alerts are automated and do not require intervention from an operator. VSLs are commonly used with automated traffic warning and lane control signs. They are also regularly combined with temporary shoulder use.\n\nTarget Market\nHow Will This Help?\nImplementation Examples\nSydney, Australia\nSydney, Australia, implemented a fog warning system that includes suggested speeds. During fog, the suggested speed limit is constantly adjusted to the speed of the previous vehicle (but no higher than the speed limit).1\nDenmark\nIn Denmark, studies found the following.\nThe VSL signs also reduced speed variance.2\nThe Netherlands\nThe Netherlands also uses VSLs for weather conditions. Visibility sensors measure the level of fog, and when visibility drops to 459 or 230 ft (140 or 70 m), the speed limit is dropped to 50 or 37 mph (80 or 60 km/h), respectively. After implementation of the VSL during fog conditions, drivers reduced their speed by 5.0\u20136.2 mph (8\u201310 km/h).3\nThe Netherlands is examining speed limits through a dynamic speed limit project. The project was developed \u201cto gain more insight into the impact of variable, tailor-made speed limits.\u201d8 A pamphlet on VSLs provides the following details on the benefits:\nAdjusting speed limits to unexpected and varying situations such as weather conditions, congestion, or an incident can improve traffic flow. It will also enhance the safety and improve local air quality. By applying a flexible and wide range of speed limits (50 to 120\u00a0km/h [31 to 75 mph]) operators can influence the actual situation on the road. Thus road users can drive faster if possible and slow down if necessary.8\nAn evaluation of permanent speed reduction showed excellent compliance (approximately 1\u00a0percent violators) due to enforcement. Reductions in emissions and noise level were also noted. Residents along the routes expressed thanks for the change.\nThe evaluation of VSLs in the Netherlands is currently ongoing. Researchers are exploring how to use data from traffic-monitoring equipment to assist in detecting shockwaves and then to manage upstream speeds to limit the impact of the shockwave. A system called Speed Controlling Algorithm Using Shockwave Theory (Specialist) is being developed. Weather forecasts (e.g., a major rainstorm) are also considered when setting the VSLs.9\nUnited Kingdom\nUsing VSLs during heavy traffic, the United Kingdom saw:\nIn England, the Managed Motorways concept was deployed on the M42 roadway. The figure below shows compliance with the required VSL.10 The graph starts with data from January 2006 and ends with data from May 2009. In late 2007 to early 2009, the required speed limit was set at 50 mph when hard shoulder running was allowed. During this time, compliance was not as good as when the speed limit was set to 60 mph during hard shoulder running (started in early 2009). Drivers did not see the reason for the lower speed and thus drove at the higher speeds. This behavior is also shown in the decline in compliance when the speed limit was set to 40 mph.\nGermany\nOn roads with VSLs in Germany:\nDenmark\nIn Denmark, VSLs resulted in decreased speeds of less than 5 km/h and reduced speed variance. A survey showed that 46 percent of Danish travelers felt safer after the changes.7\nTexas\nThe Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), with the assistance of the Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI), currently operates a VSL pilot program. This program has VSL pilot studies in three locations (the Brownwood, Waco, and San Antonio Districts) to gauge the impacts and potential benefits of VSLs in two instances:\nTTI is analyzing the impacts of the VSL on travel speeds, safety, users\u2019 perceptions, and costs and benefits. Researchers provided TxDOT with a report that was made available to the Texas Legislature in December 2014.\nApplication Techniques and Principles\nGeneral conditions for VSL systems include:\nThe following are key factors to consider for successful deployment:\nIssues\nThis strategy has been successful in Europe but is new to the United States. Public acceptance and understanding of the system are crucial to its success. Drivers must understand why the speed limit is being reduced and that the reason is valid. All drivers must understand whether the new speed limit is suggested or required. A system that automatically changes the speed display ensures that changes take place before stop-and-go traffic begins to occur. Also, the speed limit signs have to be visible to all vehicles.\nWho Is Responsible?\nThe local TxDOT office and/or the regional mobility authority bears the responsibility of developing and maintaining VSLs. These agencies should:\nProject Time Frame\nThe lengths of VSL projects differ based on the available infrastructure and amount of planning prior to starting. The systems should have ample connections to the local traffic center. Other supporting infrastructure and policies should also be in place. Since some additional signage will be required, a typical VSL deployment may take between one and two years to begin.\nCost\nThe cost of installing VSLs on a roadway varies depending on the existing infrastructure and the selection and spacing of overhead signs, changeable message signs, and other related signage.\nData Needs\nThe following standard traffic information helps determine the need for a VSL system:\n\u00a0Variable Speed Limits Best Practices\nFor More Information\nJones, J.

However, achieving both accuracy and interpretability in prediction models remains challenging due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Traffic Flow Prediction LLM (TF-LLM), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate interpretable traffic flow predictions. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, TF-LLM captures complex spatial-temporal patterns and external factors such as weather conditions, Points of Interest (PoIs), date, and holidays. We fine-tune the LLM framework using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Our comprehensive multi-modal traffic flow dataset (CATraffic) in California enables the evaluation of TF-LLM against state-of-the-art deep learning baselines. Results demonstrate TF-LLM\u2019s competitive accuracy while providing intuitive and interpretable predictions. We discuss the spatial-temporal and input dependencies for explainable future flow forecasting, showcasing TF-LLM\u2019s potential for diverse city prediction tasks. This paper contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation.\nKeywords: Traffic flow prediction, Large language models, Explainability.\n\n2 Introduction\nTraffic flow prediction is a typical spatial-temporal problem and plays a critical role in urban planning, transportation management, and infrastructure development. With the increasing availability and importance of large spatio-temporal datasets in traffic such as traffic sensing data, human-flow, and GPS trajectories, deep learning-based traffic analysis[1] have become popular, covering human mobility research[2][3], traffic management[4][5], and accident analysis[6]. Typically, these issues are treated as spatio-temporal deep learning problems. Deep learning methods consistently learn hierarchical feature representations from spatial-temporal data, understand historical trends[7][8], and employ graphs to illustrate the spatial relationships between locations[9][10]. The spatio-temporal-graph learning paradigm is the primary methodology for learning representations and capturing potential trends and relationships from traffic data.\nWell-established deep learning models usually perform well in prediction accuracy, leveraging advanced architectures, which can empower decision-makers in optimizing traffic flow, mitigating congestion, and improving overall transportation efficiency. However, developing prediction models that are both accurate and explainable is still confronted with challenges. Traffic data inherently embodies complex spatio-temporal patterns influenced by diverse factors such as weather conditions, road networks, events, and human behavior. Accurately capturing these dynamics necessitates models with high capacity and sophisticated learning mechanisms[11][12]. However, such models often lack interpretability, as they are artificially crafted and tend to prioritize prediction accuracy over explainability. Moreover, the abstract representations inherent in deep-learning methodologies further obscure generalization ability, despite their efficacy in achieving accurate predictions. This emphasis on accuracy often results in opaque systems that offer limited insight into the underlying mechanisms governing predictions and how inputs contribute to them. As a result, striking a balance between prediction accuracy and interpretability remains a critical challenge in the development of traffic prediction models.\nRecently, with the popularity of foundation models[13][14], spatial-temporal learning tasks are gradually refined into language format for exploring the potential of large language models(LLMs) in various application fields, including forecasting, classification, missed data imputation, and anomaly detection. Considering multi-modalities in urban big data, the LLM framework transfers original data into natural language description and is capable of capturing latent relationships between inputs from complicated contexts. Also, LLMs can generate explanations of the reasoning process, which provides available supplements for prediction and decision-making. However, spatial-temporal alignments are required because foundation models are pre-trained based on vast language text datasets, leading to poor performance in domain tasks.\nTo alleviate the influence of the challenges mentioned above, we present Traffic Flow Prediction LLM (TF-LLM), an explainable traffic prediction model. Considering multi-modalities as input, our framework transferred the spatial-temporal traffic flow and external factors (PoIs, weather, date, holiday) as languages. We take the language-based instruction fine-tuned as the alignment method. After directly fine-tuning, TF-LLM performs well compared with deep learning SOTA baselines, evaluated based on different traffic flow datasets. Also, spatial-temporal and input dependencies are discussed for explainable future flow forecasting. This study\u2019s contributions are as follows:\nWe present a comprehensive multi-modality traffic flow dataset (CATraffic) in California, covering traffic sensors from various areas with weather, nearby PoIs, and holiday information factors. It can be used for future explainable learning-based prediction work.\nA traffic flow prediction method based on large language models - TF-LLM is proposed to generate interpretable prediction results, still maintaining competitive accuracy with SOTAs.\nTF-LLM demonstrates a language-based format considering multi-modalities and instruction spatial-temporal alignment, which provide an intuitive view and can be simply generalized to different city prediction tasks.\nFor the rest part of the paper, the related works are involved in Section II and details about methodology are illustrated in Section III. Comparison results, ablation, and explainable case studies are included in experimental results and analysis, as Section IV. Section V summarizes this paper and gives sights for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation.\n\n3 Related Work\nIn this section, we will first explore advancements in traffic flow prediction, emphasizing the integration of deep learning methodologies. Subsequently, we\u2019ll delve into the importance of explainable prediction, discussing methods for enhancing interpretability in spatial-temporal learning. Finally, we\u2019ll highlight the transformative role of LLMs across diverse domains, elucidating their pre-training and fine-tuning practices for domain-specific tasks.\n\n3.1 Traffic flow prediction\nRecently, the field of spatial-temporal learning has witnessed significant advancements, particularly in traffic flow prediction, due to the emergence of deep learning methodologies. These approaches have enabled the modeling of latent relationships among various features of traffic flow in diverse formats. These architectural designs are meticulously crafted to comprehend and represent the intricate interplay between spatial and temporal dimensions within datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs)[2][15], quite renowned for their efficacy in computer vision, are employed to discern the spatial relations among grid regions, by filtering the input data. Moreover, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)[16] are usually leveraged to adeptly capture temporal dependencies, through the maintenance of a memory state, facilitating the reusing of information over time. Notably, more spatial-temporal learning frameworks introduce Graph Neural Networks(GNNs)[17][18][19], advanced in the representation of complex spatial relationships inherent in data structured as graphs, wherein nodes correspond to spatial locations and edges encapsulate the connections between them. Additionally, the adaptation of Transformers[20], originally proposed for natural language processing, has proven effective in long-sequence modeling to capture comprehensive information. Various Transformer blocks[21][22] have been tailored for different dependencies among spatial-temporal features, enabling the modeling of intricate relationships. A notable trend in this domain is the combination of different model architectures, leveraging various modules for spatial or temporal features[23][24]. This amalgamation gradually becomes the prevailing paradigm, showcasing promising performance in prediction tasks. However, it\u2019s worth noting that while these methods perform excellent in prediction accuracy, they often fall short in terms of explainability and generalization.\n\n3.2 Explainable prediction\nThe interpretability of spatial-temporal learning is also worthy of consideration for reliable prediction, which provides abundant views beyond prediction accuracy. Most recent works studied which features mostly affect decisions generated by models. [25] focuses on the dependency on latent variables of road forecasting based on black-box machine learning methods, including RNNs and Random Forests. The spatial-temporal causal graph inference, as presented in reference [26], offers an approximation of the Granger causality test, thereby enhancing the accessibility of forecasting. Counterfactual explanations for time series [27][28] are also highly regarded, as they concentrate on generating alternative prediction outcomes by selecting time series data points from the training set and substituting them into the sample under analysis. This method allows for the illustration of results by examining a limited number of variables. Large Language Models offer an alternative approach to interpreting prediction results with greater intuitiveness[29][30][31]. By mapping natural language-based inputs to outputs, this relationship can be studied simply by altering the input, without the requirements for complex feature engineering or model architecture adjustments.\n\n3.3 Large language models\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks and fields, including natural language processing[32], vision-language tasks[33], and various other interdisciplinary domains[34],[35]. Originally designed as pre-trained language foundation models for addressing various natural language tasks, LLMs have exhibited the capacity to acquire intricate semantic and knowledge representations from extensive text corpora over time. This newfound ability has been a profound source of inspiration within the community for addressing a variety of tasks. The success of models like GPT-4[13] in natural language understanding and generation tasks has spurred interest in exploring their potential for handling complex, multi-modal datasets beyond traditional linguistic domains. They can extract valuable information and relationships from complex textual contexts, thereby enhancing the learning of city data. With the popularity of decoder-architecture LLMs, domain tasks are normally formulated into the next token generation, which provides a unified formulation to learn the map from the input to the output. To acquire large models for specific fields, the practices of pre-training and fine-tuning have become widely accepted in the model training process. Pre-training a foundation model from scratch necessitates substantial computing resources and domain-specific datasets, resulting in its superior performance within professional domains compared to baseline models. On the other hand, fine-tuning based on foundation models offers a more accessible approach, involving adjustments to only a few parameters[36]. This method preserves most general knowledge while targeting expertise in domain-specific tasks. In some cases, researchers freeze all parameters of large language models and focus solely on training the extended encoders and decoders[37][38]. This strategy aims to extend the learning capabilities of LLMs to domain-specific tasks while leveraging their existing knowledge base.\n\n4 Methodology\nIn the following sections, we will provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to traffic flow prediction. Firstly, we\u2019ll describe the problem formulation and the predictive framework. Next, we\u2019ll discuss the construction of prompts, crucial for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). Finally, we\u2019ll delve into the supervised fine-tuning process.\n\n4.1 Problem Description\nThe traffic flow prediction problem as a part of spatial-temporal prediction problems, can be formulated as forecasting future values according to the historical data. In our framework, the goal is to predict future-step values and generate explanations based on text prompts from historical values and external factors.\nThe function f\ud835\udc53fitalic_f means that LLM considered as a prediction model, learns the mapping relationship between input and output. XT\u2212H\u22121:T\u22121subscript\ud835\udc4b:\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3b1\ud835\udc471X_{T-H-1:T-1}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T - italic_H - 1 : italic_T - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, XT:T+Hsubscript\ud835\udc4b:\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3bX_{T:T+H}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T : italic_T + italic_H end_POSTSUBSCRIPT represent continuous historical values and future predicted values with H steps. Sisubscript\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56S_{i}italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT demonstrates the spatial attributes of the region i\ud835\udc56iitalic_i. Eisubscript\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56E_{i}italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT includes external factors such as the date, holiday, and weather information within the region. T\ud835\udc47Titalic_T is the explanation generated by LLMs illustrating how it captures the input dependency and predicts the trend of this case.\n\n4.2 Prompt Construction\nThe instruction part of Figure\u00a02 showcases a meticulously crafted prompt template, designed to capture essential details consistently and comprehensively. This structured format is tailored to convey diverse data modalities, boost the model\u2019s comprehension, and refine predictive accuracy. Given the innate capacity of Language Models (LLMs) for textual reasoning, spatial-temporal data is fashioned into language-based inputs. These inputs are enriched with task-specific descriptions and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts as shown in Figure\u00a03, strategically crafted to enhance the LLMs\u2019 reasoning capabilities. System prompts are designed to incorporate task illustrations and relevant knowledge, thereby priming LLMs for prediction tasks. This approach ensures the adaptability of LLMs to the specific requirements of prediction tasks. Furthermore, to empower LLMs to glean informative factors from inputs, CoT prompts guide the model to first consider spatial attributes and temporal periods. Subsequently, the model is prompted to reason through potential traffic patterns within the specified area during the predicted time frame.\nMulti-modal information prompts serve as the cornerstone of our approach. In this context, spatial attributes are derived from nearby Points of Interest (PoIs). We preprocess PoI category data within different proximity ranges (3km, 5km, 10km), aligning with the locations of traffic volume sensors in the designated area. This ensures comprehensive coverage of diverse spatial attributes across the dataset, acknowledging the varied traffic patterns influenced by different locations.\nTo achieve this, we employ clustering techniques to group PoIs within each designated radius, ultimately organizing them into 1000 clusters. These clusters are then summarized into distinct categories such as transportation hubs, commercial zones, and residential areas, effectively representing the key characteristics of each geographical area. This approach facilitates a nuanced representation of spatial attributes, enabling the model to grasp the intricate interplay between various factors impacting traffic flow dynamics. Also, regional data comprises details such as the city, and road location. The TF-LLM framework leverages this multifaceted information to recognize and integrate spatio-temporal patterns across diverse regions and time periods.\nHistorical series and external factors are directly translated into natural language descriptions. Temporal information encompasses aspects such as the day of the week and the specific hour and holiday. This integration ensures a holistic understanding of the surrounding environment, historical trends, and external influences, enriching the model\u2019s contextual reasoning and enhancing its predictive capabilities. The structure of the instructional material for spatio-temporal data is depicted in Figure 4, and a detailed prompt design can be found in Appendix A.1.\n\n4.3 Supervised Fine-tune\nThe prediction task for LLM is framed as a next-token generation task. Following the construction of prompts in a specific format, the subsequent step involves fine-tuning the LLM. To facilitate this process, we annotate the instruction prompt section and label it with specific tokens, thereby establishing formatted instructions. Leveraging the wealth of prior knowledge and the inference capabilities inherent in foundation models, we utilize formatted-prompt datasets to fine-tune the pre-trained large language model. Our TF-LLM model is built upon the renowned open-source large language model, Llama2 [14], integrating LoRA technology [36]. LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for large language models. It modifies the self-attention layers of Transformers by introducing low-rank matrices A\ud835\udc34Aitalic_A and B\ud835\udc35Bitalic_B to represent changes to the attention weights W\ud835\udc4aWitalic_W, with \u0394\u2062W=A\u00d7B\u0394\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35\\Delta W=A\\times Broman_\u0394 italic_W = italic_A \u00d7 italic_B. This approach reduces the number of trainable parameters, as A\ud835\udc34Aitalic_A and B\ud835\udc35Bitalic_B are much smaller than W\ud835\udc4aWitalic_W, facilitating quicker and less resource-intensive adaptations while retaining model performance. Fine-tuning involves learning the compact matrices A\ud835\udc34Aitalic_A and B\ud835\udc35Bitalic_B while keeping other parameters frozen.\n\nThroughout the fine-tuning phase, we employ the Cross-Entropy loss function to compute the loss between the output tokens and labels. This loss function quantifies the disparity between the model\u2019s predicted probability distribution over tokens y^^\ud835\udc66\\hat{y}over^ start_ARG italic_y end_ARG and the actual distribution represented by the labels y\ud835\udc66yitalic_y. Mathematically, the Cross-Entropy loss can be expressed as:\nWhere yisubscript\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56y_{i}italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and yi^^subscript\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\\hat{y_{i}}over^ start_ARG italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG donate the i\ud835\udc56iitalic_i-th elements of y\ud835\udc66yitalic_y and yi^^subscript\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\\hat{y_{i}}over^ start_ARG italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG respectively. By optimizing this loss function, the model learns to make more accurate predictions tailored to the specific task or domain it is being fine-tuned for. This approach maximizes the learning potential of the LLM, enabling it to develop specialized proficiency in the target domain.\n\n5 Experiments Settings and Results\nIn this section, we will start by explaining our experimental setups. This includes detailing the dataset we used, the evaluation methods we employed, the baseline models we compared against, and the parameters we used in the fine-tuning process. Subsequently, we will present the results of our experiments. This will involve comparing TF-LLM with the baseline models, examining how prediction errors are distributed in spatio-temporal contexts, conducting ablation studies, and exploring zero-shot experiments. Finally, we will discuss the interpretability of TF-LLM in the context of traffic flow prediction. This discussion will elucidate how the robust reasoning capability inherent in large language models enhances traffic flow forecasting tasks.\n\n5.1 Dataset Description\nOur experiments are conducted using our proposed multi-modal traffic flow prediction dataset, named CATraffic. This dataset encompasses traffic volume data from various regions in California, alongside meteorological information, nearby point of interests (PoIs) data, and holiday information. The traffic volume data is sourced from the LargeST dataset [39], which comprises five years (2017-2021) of traffic flow data in California, encompassing 8600 traffic sensors sampled at 15-minute intervals. We construct our dataset by selecting a subset of this data, focusing on 1000 sensors from the Greater Los Angeles (GLA) and Greater Bay Area (GBA) regions. This subset spans a two-year period from January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2019, with data sampled hourly. During the sensor selection process, to ensure a diverse representation of traffic patterns, we cluster all sensors into 1000 categories based on their nearby PoIs features. From each category, only one sensor is retained to build our CATraffic dataset. The PoIs data is obtained through OpenStreetMap111OpenStreetMap: https://openmaptiles.org using the Overpass Turbo API222Overpass Turbo: https://overpass-turbo.eu. We record the number of different PoIs within a 10km radius in each direction to compose the final PoIs features. For meteorological data, we collect information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA333NOAA: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/), aligning it with the locations of traffic sensors. This includes factors such as reported weather events, temperature, and visibility, which are considered as they have direct impacts on traffic patterns.\nWe divided the data into two sets: data from 2018 was used as the training set, while data from 2019 was reserved for model validation. All experiments were configured to predict traffic flows for the subsequent 12 hours based on historical traffic flows data spanning the preceding 12 hours. During the data preprocessing stage, we filtered out samples with zero traffic volume for 24 consecutive hours, which likely resulted from malfunctioning sensors. Additionally, to assess the model\u2019s zero-shot capability, we created a zero-shot dataset derived from LargeST [39]. This dataset comprises data from 100 sensors in San Diego (SD), covering the period from November 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. These data were not utilized in the model fine-tuning process and serve as a means to evaluate the model\u2019s generalization performance.\n\n5.2 Evaluation Metrics\nIn time series forecasting tasks, researchers commonly employ Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), to evaluate the accuracy of forecasting results. These metrics are defined as follows:\nHere, yisubscript\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56y_{i}italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT represents the ground truth value of the i\ud835\udc56iitalic_i-th data point, y^isubscript^\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\\hat{y}_{i}over^ start_ARG italic_y end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT denotes the corresponding predicted value, and n\ud835\udc5bnitalic_n stands for the total number of samples. RMSE is advantageous for emphasizing larger errors due to its square term, while MAE provides a straightforward interpretation by averaging absolute errors, treating all errors equally. On the other hand, MAPE measures the average percentage difference between predicted and actual values, offering interpretability in terms of relative accuracy but being sensitive to zero values in the denominator. Researchers typically employ a combination of these metrics to comprehensively assess model performance.\n\n5.3 Baseline Models\nWe extensively compared our proposed TF-LLM with nine advanced baseline models. Among these, LSTM[16] stands as a temporal-only deep model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), disregarding spatial correlations. Additionally, we select DCRNN[40] and AGCRN[41] as the representation of RNNs-based methods. We also choose TCN-based methods such as STGCN[18] and GWNET[17], along with attention-based methods ASTGCN[19] and STTN[23]. These models were proposed between 2018 and 2020, reflecting the prevalent research direction in time series forecasting during those years. Furthermore, we integrated three representative methods from recent years, including STGODE[42] and DSTAGNN[43]. STGODE adeptly utilizes neural ordinary differential equations to capture the continuous changes of traffic signals, while DSTAGNN is specifically designed to capture the dynamic correlations among traffic sensors.\n\n5.4 Experiment Settings\nOur TF-LLM model is fine-tuned based on the well-known open-source large language model, Llama2 [14], specifically utilizing the chat version with a size of 7B. We load the base model in 8 bits for fine-tuning, with parameters including a batch size of 8, a learning rate of 5e-4, a warm-up step of 400, gradient accumulation steps of 8, and training for two epochs. The LoRA[36] parameters are configured with a rank of 64 and an alpha value of 16. During the inference phase, a temperature of 0.95 was applied.\n\n5.5 Overall Performance\nWe report the performance comparison results between our proposed TF-LLM and the baseline models in Table\u00a01. All models are trained and evaluated on our CATraffic dataset, with the same dataset settings. The task is to utilize traffic flows data from the historical 12 hours to forecast future traffic flows in the next 12 hours. We represent the results of horizons 3, 6, 9, and 12, as well as the average performance over all 12 steps in the table. The results demonstrate that the overall performance of our proposed TF-LLM exceeds that of the baseline models by a large margin, especially in the MAE and MAPE. For example, In terms of average performance of the 12 horizons, our model outperforms the best two baseline models (GWNET[17] and STGCN[18]) by 18.37% in MAE and 34.00% in MAPE, which exhibits the impressive capability in traffic flow forecasting of our model.\nWe further plot the results of the baseline models and TF-LLM with different prediction horizons, depicted in Figure\u00a05. From left to right, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE of comparised models at different prediction horizons are shown. The results yielded the following observations:\nAs the prediction horizon increases, performance generally declines across all models, as longer-term forecasts inherently entail greater uncertainty and complexity. However, several models exhibit improved performance in longer-term forecasting, such as LSTM, ASTGCN, and DCRNN. This phenomenon may be attributed to these models\u2019 ability to capture and leverage the periodicity within the data, allowing them to make more accurate predictions over extended time horizons.\nOur proposed model consistently outperforms the comparison methods at each time step, showing significant advantages in both short-term and long-term traffic flow forecasting. This indicates the robustness of our model in various prediction horizons.\nCompared to RMSE, our proposed model has a significant advantage in the MAE and MAPE, which is attributed to its robustness to outliers. Compared to RMSE, MAE and MAPE are less sensitive to extreme errors because they measure the mean absolute error and the percentage error, respectively. The excellent performance of our model on MAE and MAPE suggests that it is effective in mitigating the effects of outliers and provides more accurate and stable predictions, especially in cases where extreme values may occasionally occur.\nThese findings underscore the effectiveness of our method in capturing complex temporal patterns in traffic flow data, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.\n\n5.6 Spatial and Temporal Homogeneity\nEvaluating spatial and temporal homogeneity in traffic flow prediction is vital for ensuring model performance, generalizability, and robustness. It ensures that traffic flow prediction models can effectively adapt to diverse real-world conditions. Therefore, in this section, we will thoroughly analyze the performance of our proposed model in terms of spatio-temporal consistency.\nTo analyze the spatial homogeneity of our model, we conducted evaluations in various locations across the Greater Los Angeles (GLA) with diverse urban distributions to assess the generalization capability of language models in learning traffic patterns from different spatial features. We compared our proposed TF-LLM model against LSTM[16], AGCRN[41], STGCN[18] and GWNET[17], maintaining a fixed evaluation period for both settings. The results, depicted in Figure\u00a06 (a), illustrate MAPE values for prediction horizons of 3h, 6h, 9h, and 12h, with darker colors indicating poorer performance. Overall, our TF-LLM model exhibits relatively consistent prediction performance across different locations, effectively capturing traffic flow trends irrespective of spatial characteristics. In contrast, other models demonstrate inferior homogeneity, particularly in areas featuring complex road network intersections and intricate facility distributions. These findings underscore the robustness and adaptability of our proposed TF-LLM model in effectively learning and predicting traffic patterns across diverse spatial contexts, thus highlighting its potential for real-world application in urban traffic management and planning scenarios.\nIn our analysis of temporal homogeneity, we evaluated traffic test data spanning November 2019, using daily averaged MAPE values. Illustrated in Figure\u00a06 (b) as calendar heat maps, the results showcase the comparative performance across the month. Our model consistently exhibited lower daily average MAPE values, demonstrating robustness in capturing temporal nuances of traffic flow patterns. Notably, it consistently outperformed others throughout this period, emphasizing its superior capability in handling diverse temporal dynamics inherent in real-world traffic scenarios.\n\n5.7 Ablation Studies\nIn order to investigate the influence of different modal information on prompt input and different prompt strategies on model performance, we conducted comprehensive ablation experiments. The results are illustrated in Figure\u00a07.\nFrom left to right, the figures represent the average RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of TF-LLM under different prompt configurations. The results provide insightful observations on the impact of different input prompt components on predictive performance. Through the removal of various informational elements, including date, weather conditions, Points of Interest (PoI), contextual knowledge, and the Chai-of-Thought (CoT) [44] prompt, discernible trends emerge.\nIt is worth noting that the exclusion of date information yields the worst results, showing a substantial increase in all error metrics, with RMSE of 69.97, MAE of 40.44, and MAPE of 24.90%. This indicates the crucial role of temporal context in traffic flow forecasting, which enables the model to capture recurring patterns and trends in traffic behavior. Similarly, weather conditions profoundly influence traffic dynamics, affecting factors such as road surface conditions, visibility, and driver behavior. Removal of weather information leads to a notable decrease in performance metrics, highlighting its importance in accurately modeling traffic flow. Interestingly, omitting PoI information also led to moderate increases in prediction error. This shows that our TF-LLM can exploit and leverage the spatial context from PoI data which is useful in understanding traffic patterns and congestion dynamics.\nIn our studies, we also validated the effect of prompting strategies on model performance. Initially, we observed that the absence of context information led to model performance degradation, indicating the importance of domain knowledge in enhancing the predictive capabilities of TF-LLM. By leveraging insights into traffic volume, pattern characteristics, and spatial-temporal correlations, the model can anticipate variations in traffic flow dynamics with greater accuracy, resulting in more reliable forecasts. Additionally, the CoT strategy contributed to performance improvement. By incorporating insights into area attributes, predicted time zones, traffic patterns, and historical temporal trends, the model gained a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing traffic flow dynamics, thereby improving prediction performance.\nThese findings collectively emphasize the significance of incorporating comprehensive multimodal data, particularly in a temporal and environmental context, to improve the accuracy of traffic flow predictions. While certain input components exhibit more substantial impacts than others, their synergistic integration contributes to the overall predictive capability of the model.\n\n\n5.8 Zero-shot Capabilities\nLarge language models are well known for their excellent zero-shot capabilities. In this section, we delve into the zero-shot capability of our proposed TF-LLM and compare it with other large language models. We conduct zero-shot experiments using two datasets: the first is our proposed CATraffic-based zero-shot dataset, and the other is the taxiBJ dataset [2]. The taxiBJ dataset comprises taxicab GPS data and meteorology data in Beijing from four time intervals within 2013-2016, focusing on the inflow/outflow prediction task. To ensure a fair comparison, we reorganize the taxiBJ dataset into the same format as the CATraffic dataset. The overall results are presented in Table\u00a02, indicating that our proposed model exhibits superior performance across all three tasks compared to the original Llama2 series models, as well as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. For the CATraffic dataset, our TF-LLM model exhibits notable improvements over the best-performing comparative model (GPT-4) by 61.53%, 71.22%, and 85.11% in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, respectively. On the TaxiBJ dataset, our model achieves substantial performance enhancements in both inflow and outflow tasks. Compared to GPT-4, TF-LLM shows improvements of 40.32% in RMSE, 44.01% in MAE and 80.75% in MAPE in inflow prediction task, and improvements of 44.89% in RMSE, 48.13% in MAPE and 77.26% inMAPE in outflow prediction task. These results distinctly underscore the superiority of our TF-LLM model. These findings illustrate that our fine-tuned model surpasses even the state-of-the-art large language model (GPT-4) when tested on a dataset distinct from the one used for fine-tuning. This suggests that our model adeptly acquired the domain knowledge of traffic flow prediction and effectively generalized it to different scenarios.\nWe also provide visualization results in Figure\u00a08, showing 12 test samples from three different sensors in four different time periods. The results depicted in the figure highlight that our model not only captures the traffic trends of new scenarios effectively but also delivers accurate prediction values. In contrast, the Llama2 series of LLMs struggles to capture the dynamic pattern of traffic flow, regardless of model size. While GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 demonstrate the ability to describe some overarching trends in traffic, they perform inadequately in capturing nuances of variation, hindering their ability to provide accurate predictions of traffic flow values. We attribute these discrepancies to our effective prompt design and model fine-tuning. Prompts effectively describe the task context and align information from different modalities into a unified feature space, while fine-tuning infuses domain knowledge into LLMs, thereby enhancing their performance in specific fields.\n\n5.9 Interpretive Studies\nTraffic volume is expected to be low before dawn, then it is expected to increase gradually throughout the day. Since today is Wednesday, weekday patterns suggest higher traffic during rush hours and lower traffic during non-peak times. Nearby transportation areas and commercial districts will contribute to an increase in traffic volume during certain periods. Sunny weather can also contribute to increased traffic.\nTraffic volume is expected to increase and then decrease in the next 12 hours. Sunny weather with a comfortable temperature will attract more day travelers. The onset of Sunday afternoon rush hour will further contribute to increased traffic. With no known holidays or events, historical data suggest that traffic volume will resemble previous Sundays, with a slight increase during the afternoon rush hour followed by a gradual decline at night.\nTraffic volume is expected to steady increase in the rainy morning and then decrease in the afternoon. Activities at the morning rush hour in residential and commercial areas are likely to contribute to the initial rise. The rain might cause congestion, leading to a peak in volumes around midday. As the day progresses, the volume is expected to gradually decrease as people return home.\nTraffic volume is expected to decrease significantly over the next 12 hours considering a rainy Christmas Day. As it is a holiday, commuter and commercial activities are minimal, leading to reduced traffic. Additionally, the rainy weather may further deter people from traveling or driving, contributing to the decline in traffic volumes. The focus on indoor celebrations and festivities is likely to keep the roads quiet at night.\nOur proposed TF-LLM is based on Llama2-7B-chat, which is tailored to excel in understanding and generating text in conversational contexts. Therefore, by incorporating interpretability requirements into the prompts, our model can not only generate prediction results but also provide explanations simultaneously. Initially, we attempted to have the fine-tuned model directly output explanations, but the outcomes proved to be unsatisfactory. Although the generated explanations were coherent, they failed to align with the traffic flow prediction sequence. This discrepancy arose because the model fine-tuning process solely relied on traffic flow sequences for supervision, without incorporating any mechanisms to link the explanatory text with the output sequences. To address this issue, we employed the few-shot learning technique by providing several explanation examples before the original prompt text. We generate the ground truth explanation texts through ChatGPT by asking it to explain the traffic flow sequences for the next 12 hours. This approach enabled the model to learn from a limited number of examples and improve its ability to generate coherent explanations alongside predictions.\nWe report four explanatory cases generated by our TF-LLM in Table\u00a03, each with different time periods. In each example, the ground truth and our predicted result are displayed in the figure on the left (light red areas indicate the 95% confidence interval), with the corresponding interpretative output on the right. The original interpretive output was too long, so we used chatGPT to summarise it into a small paragraph for presentation purposes. A complete explanatory result can be found in Appendix\u00a0A.2 (corresponding to the last example in Table\u00a03). These four examples cover traffic flow predictions across different time periods, including weekdays, weekends, and holidays (such as Christmas). Our proposed TF-LLM consistently provides accurate prediction results and offers reasonable explanations. It is noteworthy that our model integrates factors such as time, weather, holiday information, and PoIs in the vicinity of the prediction point, ultimately yielding convincing outcomes. Previous time series prediction models could only output prediction results, lacking intuitive interpretability. However, our TF-LLM can directly interact with humans in textual form, showcasing the strength of the LLM-based method.\n\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\nIn conclusion, our research introduces TF-LLM, a novel traffic prediction model designed for both accuracy and interpretability. By incorporating multi-modal inputs and employing language-based representations, TF-LLM achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models while offering insights into its predictions. TF-LLM\u2019s language-based framework, coupled with spatial-temporal alignment instructions, provides a transparent and adaptable approach suitable for various urban prediction tasks. In general, our work contributes to the advancement of interpretable and effective traffic prediction methods, essential for informed decision-making in urban transportation planning and management.\nIn the future, we aim to delve into methods that enable LLMs to harness spatial information more effectively and to grasp how different sensors are related spatially. This will help them make better predictions by considering data from nearby sensors. Achieving this might involve helping LLMs understand graph structures, which could be a promising research direction. Furthermore, exploring the development of LLM systems tailored for urban brains is a very interesting but challenging topic. This entails integrating city-level data into LLMs to tackle various downstream tasks like urban planning, traffic management, and pollution control, etc. Achieving this involves the challenge of enabling LLMs to efficiently utilize city-level multimodal data, alongside the need for substantial computational resources and exceptional engineering capabilities.\n\n7 Acknowledgements\nThis research is funded by multiple sources, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52302379, the Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Projects under Grants 2023A03J0106 and 2024A04J4290, the Guangdong Province General Universities Youth Innovative Talents Project under Grant 2023KQNCX100, and the Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project 2023A03J0011.\nReferences\n\nAppendix A Appendix\n\nA.1 Prompt Design\nThe prompt for TF-LLM in traffic flow prediction is carefully designed, as shown in Table\u00a04.

      "The 10 Coolest Big Data Tools Of 2024 (So Far)\nHere\u2019s a look at 10 new, expanded and improved big data tools, platforms, systems and services that solution and service providers should be aware of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Data, Cool Tools\nData management, already of significant importance for operational and business intelligence purposes, has taken on a new level of priority for businesses and organizations as the wave of AI technology development and adoption pushes demands for data to new heights.\nThe global \u201cdatasphere\u201d \u2013 the total amount of data created, captured, replicated and consumed \u2013 is growing at more than 20 percent a year and is forecast to reach approximately 291 zettabytes by 2027, according to market researcher IDC.\nBut wrangling all that data, including collecting and managing it and preparing it for analytical and AI tasks, is a challenge with so much data to work with. That\u2019s driving demand for new big data tools and technologies \u2013 from both established IT vendors and startups \u2013 to help businesses access, collect, manage, move, transform, analyze, understand, measure, govern, maintain and secure all this data.\nWhat follows is a look at 10 cool big data tools designed to help customers more effectively carry out all these big data chores. They include next-generation databases, data management tools and data analytics software. Some are entirely new products recently introduced by startups or established vendors, while others are products that have undergone significant upgrades or offer ground-breaking new capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomalo\nAnomalo\u2019s data quality monitoring platform has been gaining market traction as artificial intelligence applications and large language models drive demand for not just more data, but more high-quality data.\nThe Anomalo system makes use of machine learning technology to monitor data quality and automatically detect and understand the root cause of data issues, including erroneous data and missing or incomplete data.\nOn June 12 Anomalo said it had expanded its platform\u2019s data quality monitoring capabilities to include unstructured text data \u2013 a critical addition given that generative AI applications often make use of large amounts of text.\nThe Palo Alto, Calif.-based company raised $33 million in Series B funding in January. The company is closely allied with data lakehouse giant Databricks, which is an investor and in June named Anomalo its Emerging Partner of the Year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabricks LakeFlow And AI/BI\nData lake platform developer Databricks launched a number of new software and services at its Data + AI Summit in early June with Databricks LakeFlow and Databricks AI/BI topping the list.\nDatabricks Lakeflow is a unified, intelligent data engineering system that combines all aspects of data engineering including data ingestion, transformation and orchestration. Data teams can use LakeFlow to ingest data at scale from databases such as MySQL, Postgres and Oracle and enterprise applications such as Salesforce, Workday, Sharepoint, NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics and Google Analytics.\nLakeFlow automates the deployment, operation and monitoring of data pipelines in production with CI/CD support, advanced workflows, and built-in data quality checks and data health monitoring. Key components include LakeFlow Connect for data ingestion, LakeFlow Pipelines for automating real-time data pipelines, and LakeFlowJobs for orchestrating workflows across the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform.\nDatabricks AI/BI is a next-generation business intelligence product that aims to bring data analytics and insights to a wider audience of business users. It includes Dashboards, an AI-powered, low-code tool for building and distributing interactive dashboards; and Genie, a conversational interface for using natural language for ad-hoc and follow-up queries. Dashboards and Genie are both powered by a compound AI system that learns from ongoing usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDB Postgres AI\nIn May database provider EDB unveiled EDB Postgres AI, an intelligent database platform that\u2019s capable of performing transactional, analytical and AI data workloads.\nDatabase systems have traditional been developed and used for either transaction processing or data analysis tasks, given the very different data demands and database designs for each. And the rapidly growing wave of AI applications is creating its own set of unique demands for how data is managed and used.\nEDB, which has long sold database software and related services based on the Postgres open-source database, said the new EDB Postgres AI system supports transactional, analytical, AI and machine learning workloads and applications \u2013 either running in the cloud, on premises or on a physical appliance.\nKey capabilities of EDB Postgres AI include rapid analytics for transactional data, intelligent observability for managing and operationalizing data insights, support for vectorized data, continuous high availability for mission-critical applications, and the ability to modernize legacy database systems using EDB\u2019s Oracle Compatibility Mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMongoDB AI Applications Program\nPulling together all the technology components to assemble a complete IT and data stack for building and running generative applications is a challenge.\nIn May MongoDB debuted the MongoDB AI Applications Program (MAAP), which provides a complete technology stack, services and other resources to help businesses develop and deploy at scale applications with advanced generative AI capabilities.\nMore of a program and blueprint than a product, MAAP \u2013 with the MongoDB Atlas cloud database and development platform at its core \u2013 includes reference architectures and technology from a who\u2019s who in the AI space including the cloud platform giants, LLM (large language model) tech developers Cohere and Anthropic, and a number of AI development tool companies including Fireworks.ai, LlamaIndex and Credal.ai.\nThe program also includes strategic advisory and professional services from MongoDB and a number of the company\u2019s systems integrator and consulting partners. MAAP is scheduled to be generally available in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherDuck\nMotherDuck, a serverless data analytics platform based on the open-source DuckDB database, became generally available on June 11. Early editions of the much-anticipated software have been in various trial stages for about a year.\nThe company is pitching the new software as an easy-to-use data analytics tool that does not need complex supporting data infrastructure. Making use of advancements in computer hardware performance, the DuckDB-MotherDuck combo can process large amounts of data on a single machine and meet the needs of 99 percent of users who don\u2019t require a complex petabyte-scale system.\nMotherDuck assigns compute resources to each user, cutting costs and simplifying administration, and utilizes local compute resources through hybrid cloud-local \u201cdual-execution\u201d queries. Businesses and organizations can avoid spending huge sums for data infrastructure usually needed only for extremely high-performance data analysis tasks, according to the company.\nSeattle-based MotherDuck was co-founded in 2022 by Google BigQuery founding engineer Jordan Tigani, now MotherDuck CEO. The company raised $52.5 million in Series B funding in September 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinecone Serverless\nThe Pinecone Serverless vector database, unveiled in January and generally available in May, is designed to help businesses develop generative AI applications that are fast, accurate and scalable.\nThe large language models that power generative AI software require huge volumes of data to operate. Pinecone says that making more data or \u201cknowledge\u201d available to LLMs improves the quality of the answers generated by GenAI applications. But storing and searching through sufficient amounts of vector data on-demand is a challenge.\nThe new PineCone Serverless database, which builds on the company\u2019s core vector database that launched in 2021, \u201clets companies add practically unlimited knowledge to their GenAI applications,\u201d Pinecone says. It eliminates the need for developers to provision or manage infrastructure and allows developers to use any LLM of their choice.\nThe Pinecone Serverless architecture separates data reads, writes and storage and includes a multi-tenant compute layer for efficient on-demand data retrieval for thousands of users, according to Pinecone. The database uses new indexing and retrieval algorithms for fast and memory-efficient vector search from blob storage without sacrificing retrieval quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQlik Talend Cloud And Qlik Answers\nIn June Qlik launched Qlik Talend Cloud, a new data management platform incorporating technology stemming from Qlik\u2019s 2023 acquisition of Talend. It is slated for general availability later this summer.\nQlik Talend Cloud is built on the Qlik Cloud infrastructure and provides a unified package of data integration and data curation capabilities for building and deploying AI-augmented ELT (extract, load and transform) pipelines that deliver trusted data assets throughout an organization.\nThe platform delivers AI-augmented data integration with \u201cextensive\u201d data quality and data governance capabilities, according to the company. It\u2019s data engineering tools provide a spectrum of data transformation capabilities \u2013 from no-code to pro-code options \u2013 for creating AI-ready data for complex AI projects.\nQlik Talend Cloud incorporates SaaS data connectivity functionality from Talend\u2019s 2018 acquisition of startup Stitch, boosting the platform\u2019s ability to work with diverse data sources. The platform also includes a curated data marketplace that simplifies data discovery and data sharing, and the Qlik Talend Trust Score for AI for assessing data health and quality for AI readiness.\nAlso in June Qlik launched Qlik Answers, a new generative AI assistant for utilizing unstructured data. Qlik Answers, which incorporates technology from the company\u2019s Kyndi acquisition in January, is an out-of-the-box, generative AI-powered knowledge assistant for searching, accessing and utilizing unstructured data from a broad range of sources including PDF and Word documents, webpages and Microsoft Sharepoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScoop Analytics\nStartup Scoop Analytics just emerged from stealth with its new business analytics tool that\u2019s powered entirely by spreadsheets.\nThe software makes it possible for anyone with spreadsheet skills to collect data from any application, blend data from different sources and use it to create \u201cvisually compelling data stories\u201d through slide presentations based on live data, according to the company.\nThe Scoop platform collects or \u201cscoops\u201d application reports from a wide range of operational applications such as Salesforce. At the heart of the Scoop system is an advanced time series analysis engine that automatically creates a time series database, and workflows that move the data into a full-featured spreadsheet that\u2019s used to blend, augment and query data and create dashboards, charts and graphs.\nCo-founder and CEO Brad Peters says Scoop\u2019s mission is to \u201cdeliver data analytics in a form factor that doesn\u2019t require a data team\u201d and achieve the long-time goal of true self-service business intelligence.\nSan Francisco-based Scoop Analytics was founded by Peters and others who previously worked at business analytics software developer Birst. The company officially launched June 18 with $3.5 million in seed funding from Ridge Ventures, Industry Ventures and Engineering Capital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarburst Galaxy Icehouse\nIn April Starburst launched Galaxy Icehouse, a fully managed data analytics service based on its Galaxy cloud data lakehouse platform combined with the Apache Iceberg table format for managing huge analytic datasets.\nStarburst offers the new lakehouse platform as a high-performance, more cost-effective alternative to competing cloud data lake and data warehouse services for data management, data analytics and AI tasks.\nGalaxy Icehouse combines the open-source Trino SQL query engine \u2013 the core of the Starburst platform \u2013 with the Apache Iceberg data table format to create a fully managed data lake service that the company says provides \u201cpowerful scalability, cost-effectiveness and query performance.\u201d\nThe service helps organizations avoid the burden and cost of building and maintaining a custom data lake system \u201cwithout the risk of vendor lock-in.\u201d The company also touted the service\u2019s effectiveness in handling compute-intensive data transformation and preparation workloads.\nGalaxy Icehouse supports near real-time, petabyte-scale data ingestion into Iceberg managed tables. Data and development teams can use SQL to prepare and optimize data for production analytics, the company said, along with the auto-tuning capabilities in Starburst Warp Speed to improve query performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurrealDB\nSurrealDB is a multi-modal database that allows developers to use multiple techniques to store and model data.\nWhile SurrealDB can use tables similarly to relational databases, it is a document database at its core and offers the additional functionality and flexibility found in other NoSQL or \u201cNewSQL\u201d databases.\nDevelopers are adopting multi-modal databases to quickly adapt to different data requirements and reduce the need to operate multiple database systems, according to SurrealDB. And the company says \u201ca rapidly growing number\u201d of businesses and organizations are consolidating multiple, disparate databases onto SurrealDB to simplify data management operations, maintain data consistency and cut expenses.\nAfter numerous beta releases, SurrealDB 1.0.0 debuted on September 13, 2023. Release 1.5.3, the current production edition, was released on June 14 while SurrealDB 2.0.0-alpha.3 was just released on June 25.\nIn addition to the database SurrealDB offers the Surrealist management application to manage schema and data within the database. The company also just announced beta access to Surreal Cloud.\nSurrealDB, based in London, said on June 18 it had raised $20 million in a new funding round.\n",

The top-quartile companies automated processes and enabled fast decisions by employees at all levels using trusted and easily accessible data. Real-time decision-making enables digital customer journeys that are more seamless, empowered employee experiences, and increased business agility. This briefing describes what it takes to become a real-time business. We dig into the performance premium and illustrate the journey of becoming a real-time business with a case study of United Airlines.\nAny visitor to the website can read many MIT CISR Research Briefings in the webpage.

Follow the series on SoundCloud.\nWhile most companies have not yet completed their digitally enabled business transformations, what\u2019s next for leading companies is to operate more in real time. Real-time businesses are those that can respond immediately to opportunities and challenges by executing key business processes through automated digitized operations and employee-made data-driven decisions, supported by governance and risk guardrails.\nIn a study with Insight Partners, we found that companies operating in the top quartile versus the bottom quartile of \u201creal-time-ness\u201d had more than 50 percent higher revenue growth and net margins\u2014a huge premium.[foot]Insight Partners (https://www.insightpartners.com/) and Peter Weill of MIT CISR collaborated in 2023 on a study of real-time businesses, administering a survey of 259 global companies and conducting interviews at 4 companies. Respondents were all CxOs. All the financial results reported were adjusted for industry and statistically significant (p<0.01). Respondents assessed the extent of their company\u2019s \u201creal-time-ness\u201d with a single measure. Respondents self-reported performance metrics including revenue growth and net margin. 50 organizations in the study were publicly traded, and we collected publicly reported net margin and revenue growth for them. The correlations between self-reported and publicly reported performance were over 0.5 and statistically significant at p<0.01, so the analyses used the self-reported financial performance metrics. The Insight Partners research team in 2023 included Maxime de Planta, Daniel Prior, and Elizabeth van den Berg.[/foot] The top-quartile companies automated processes and enabled fast decisions by employees at all levels using trusted and easily accessible data. Real-time decision-making enables digital customer journeys that are more seamless, empowered employee experiences, and increased business agility.\nOperating increasingly in real-time helps companies sense and respond to changes in an increasingly volatile business environment. There is no longer time to pass decisions up and down the traditional business hierarchy. This briefing describes what it takes to become a real-time business (RTB) and illustrates the journey with a case study of United Airlines.\nReal-Time Business Performance\nIn our research, top quartile RTB companies performed significantly better than bottom-quartile RTB companies, with 62 percent higher revenue growth and 97 percent higher profit margins. The top-quartile companies were superior at just about everything we measured. Compared to bottom-quartile RTB companies, top-quartile RTB companies were:\nReducing the lag from sensing a threat or opportunity to acting on it and providing feedback allows companies to be more agile and to course-correct when needed. Trusting the same data across the company reduces the need to double-check it and helps improve operational efficiency and enable better risk management. Most importantly, both customers and employees are more likely to be satisfied when answers, actions, or both are immediate.\nHowever, becoming a top-quartile RTB requires significant changes for most companies. It means moving from relying on gut feel and experience to evidence-based decision-making, with high levels of trust in and empowerment of employees, along with increased automation and the use of AI.\nFour Capabilities That Help Drive Real-Time Businesses\nExcellence in four capabilities\u2014real-time data for decision-making, integrated customer experience, business agility, and high-quality employee experience (see figure 1)\u2014distinguished the real-time businesses in our research from the rest. We will explore the four capabilities, and then describe how they were implemented at United Airlines.\nReal-Time Data for Decision-Making\nThe foundation of an RTB is having easy access to trusted real-time data for use as inputs to automated decision-making and in decision-making by employees and systems, tracking company performance on key metrics, and real-time governance and risk management. The other three capabilities rely on access to real-time data for decision-making.\nIntegrated Customer Experience\nA hallmark of an RTB is integrated customer experience. An RTB supports customers in navigating their journeys, identifying multiple products from different parts of the company that customers can easily acquire and combine to fulfill their needs. Self-service, which requires real-time data on both products and customers to deliver, is another hallmark of an RTB.\nBusiness Agility\nAn RTB\u2019s distinguishing attribute is the ability to sense a threat or opportunity, course correct, and change direction without getting multiple (sometimes redundant) approvals or undergoing a multiyear change management program. The real-time data enables employees to simplify, rationalize, and improve product offerings in the current business model with streamlined approvals for key decisions. The access to real-time data and dashboards enables employees to identify trends that could inspire a change in business models. The combination of real-time data and simplified governance empowers people at all levels of the company to identify opportunities and issues, then make and be accountable for decisions to address them.\nHigh-Quality Employee Experience\nRTBs use real-time data to create a better employee experience and transform the jobs of the company\u2019s people. Automating tasks allows people to spend far less time doing repetitive, often paper-intensive work and instead to focus on improving processes and innovating. Using real-time data in dashboards enables employees to better understand how the company is doing and how they contribute to the company\u2019s performance.\nCoordinated Development of the Capabilities\nThe change needed to operate in real time can feel daunting for many leadership teams. The good news is that it isn\u2019t necessary to be brilliant at the outset at delivering fully real-time data for decision-making; instead, the company just needs enough real-time data and decisions to enable the other three capabilities to generate value daily. In time, the company will be able to increase all four of the capabilities in concert. Think of the real-time data and decisions as the rotor on a helicopter, providing the power to the three blades (integrated customer experience, employee experience, and business agility) to achieve lift. Just having enough real-time data focused in the areas of the three other capabilities will boost performance. As confidence grows, increasing real-time data and decisions will enable the blades to spin faster and achieve more performance lift.\nReal-Time Business at United Airlines\nIn 2023, United Airlines, Inc. (United) had over 100,000 employees and operated 938 aircraft,[foot]\u201cWho We Are,\u201d Newsroom, United Airlines, Inc., accessed July 16, 2024, https://www.united.com/en/us/newsroom/corporate-fact-sheet.html#whoWeAre.[/foot] producing revenues of $53.7 billion. United\u2019s performance was strong, with one-year revenue growth of 19.5 percent,[foot]United Airlines, Inc., 2023 Annual Report, February 29, 2024, from the United Airlines, Inc. investor relations website, https://ir.united.com/static-files/70da0afa-4159-4666-a6b3-c093e9712981.[/foot] and a net margin of 6.3 percent (versus an industry average of 4.0 percent).[foot]D&B Hoovers, \u201cUnited Airlines Holdings, Inc., Ratio Comparisons,\u201d as of June 28, 2024, https://app.hoovers.dnb.com/company/0e4be56a-697b-31ed-ba9e-7e95e73333ea#report/company_ratio_comparison.[/foot] The company\u2019s customer experience, based on a net promoter score of 50, was nearly double the industry average.[foot]In 2023, CustomerGauge reported an airline industry average Net Promoter Score of 26 and a United Airlines score of 50. See Ian Luck, \u201c26 Airline NPS Score Benchmarks & Airline Customer Experience Tips,\u201d CustomerGauge Blog, March 8, 2023, https://customergauge.com/blog/airline-customer-experience-net-promoter-score.[/foot] United has made great progress in becoming an RTB\u2014with a United twist.\nReal-Time Data for Decision-Making\nUnited has invested heavily in making trusted real-time data available to its people. United started by consolidating multiple data sources into one data hub, then served that data to customers and employees via digital channels. United uses this data to make better decisions about flight routes, diagnose reasons for delays, help passengers make their connections, suggest ways to use fuel more efficiently, and more.\nFor example, United created a tool called Connection Saver that monitors connections in real-time. It calculates whether connecting passengers will make or miss their connections and identifies the solution that disrupts the least number of people. If holding a flight for five or ten minutes would help a good number of passengers get on board, the flight crew will wait.\nIntegrated Customer Experience\nIn 2022, United found that 85 percent of its customers used the company\u2019s mobile app as part of their trip. With a design based on customer journey mapping, the United Airlines app gives customers real-time information about their trip and the power to take action. The highly rated app[foot]The app was the winner of the Battle of the Apps at the 2023 World Aviation Festival; see Jess Brownlow, \u201cThe Battle of the Apps final: \u2018And the winner is\u2026\u2019,\u201d on the World Aviation Festival website, October 6, 2023, https://worldaviationfestival.com/blog/airlines/the-battle-of-the-apps-final-and-the-winner-is.[/foot] allows users to check in for a flight, track bags, rebook flights, and chat with an agent.\nUnited is now moving from empowering to predicting. The company\u2019s goal is to use the data not only in real time but also to anticipate what will be needed in the future and make an offer in advance of the need. For example, if United knows that your flight might be delayed, and observes that you take this flight regularly, the company can anticipate your need to rebook your flight and offer real-time booking changes in response to the delay.\nBusiness Agility\nTo enable agility, United works hard to break its big programs into modules that can be pursued in short, defined efforts. For example, United has a large project underway to transform a critical legacy ticketing platform. Management has agreed to fund the whole program, but the implementation is being pursued in bite-sized pieces. Each module of work requires only a short conversation (less than an hour) to approve it; when the company is done managing one module, it moves to the next. Such structure has rendered building a big governance mechanism to allocate capital unnecessary. United designs work this way throughout the company with the goal that no one module of work for an approved project is big enough to require a separate governance bureaucracy that might slow progress.\nHigh-Quality Employee Experience\nRunning an airline is a complex business involving real-time issues with variables such as weather, catering, and flight maintenance. United runs its operations in real time and has created a data environment that allows the company to make recommendations in real time. For example, if a storm is predicted for the Newark Airport area, United runs every flight permutation and adjusts plans to minimize the impact on passengers, crew, and aircraft. It used to be a slog to gather and analyze the data to make some kind of informed guess; now, models do it in real time. And flight attendants are provided with their own specialized app that lets them help customers in real time while en route, making the attendant\u2019s job easier. United developed the flight attendant app because the company discovered, via data analysis, that responding to customer complaints in real time is more important to customers than providing greater compensation at a later stage.\nUnited has made great progress in becoming an RTB, but there is much more to do. For United, being a real-time business enables it to earn a customer\u2019s trust by solving problems quickly, often via a device in the palm of their hand. United has invested heavily to ensure they have all customer and operations data available so all 100,000 employees can make the right decisions at the right time.\nWhat It Takes to Succeed in Real-Time Business\nHow real time is your business? Many companies, like United, are already working to become RTBs. Imagine what your company would look like if the key decisions and operations were made in real time based on trusted data. The journey to become an RTB starts with creating and consolidating enough trusted data to make key decisions, then empowering employees to empower customers, and finally predicting and satisfying customer and business needs in real time.\n\u00a9 2024 MIT Center for Information Systems Research, Weill, van den Berg, Birnbaum, and de Planta.

Based on experience drawn\nfrom successful deployment examples throughout the world, this guide can help agencies\n(1) identify conditions that make a corridor a good candidate for the implementation of\nATM; (2) develop performance goals and select appropriate performance measures for the\ncorridor; (3) identify ATM strategies that are likely to contribute to meeting those perfor-\nmance goals across the full range of operating conditions for that corridor (e.g., recurring\ncongestion, incidents, special events, evacuation); and (4) select deterministic, simulation,\nand/or other analysis tools suitable for evaluating the likely impacts of a planned installa-\ntion, conducting scenario planning, analyzing the system performance in real time, and\nconducting after-action evaluations. The material in this guide will be of immediate interest\nto transportation management system managers, engineers, and planners at local and state\ntransportation agencies as well as transit and metropolitan planning organizations.\n\n\n   Recent initiatives in the United States and Europe pointed to the largely untapped potential\nof ATM to dynamically manage recurrent and nonrecurrent congestion based on prevailing\nand predicted traffic conditions. Since ATM strategies are new to many agencies and differ\nin many ways from traditional capital projects, they can present challenges during the plan-\nning, programming, budgeting, staffing, operational, and maintenance phases.\n   Under NCHRP Project 03-114(01), \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlanning and Evaluating Active Traffic Management\nStrategies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Texas A&M Transportation Institute team was asked to develop resources\nto help transportation agencies decide which ATM strategies could help them achieve their\nobjectives, including improving safety, reducing congestion, and improving travel-time reli-\nability for all road users of different modes. The guide can assist agencies using performance\ndata (field, probe, or synthetic data) for activities such as real-time system monitoring and\noperations, agency dashboards, performance trend analyses, and performance-based plan-\nning to support ATM deployment. The guide also offers information on developing a budget\nand staffing plan for installing, operating, and maintaining the system; demonstrating to\nsenior management, elected officials, and the public the value of the selected ATM strategies\nfor that corridor; and addressing institutional and other barriers associated with the deploy-\nment, maintenance, and operation of ATM strategies.\n   The guide is accompanied by NCHRP Web-Only Document 402: Developing a Planning and\nEvaluation Guide for Active Traffic Management Strategies, related presentation materials,\nand an implementation plan that identifies opportunities for dissemination and moving\nresearch into practice.

For many industrial manufacturers, the response of the supply network to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical challenges, and natural disasters thrust supply chain resilience into the limelight. But the pendulum appears to be swinging back, with costs and margin pressures once again at the forefront as companies reevaluate their supply chains.\nAs of early 2024, supply chain pressures have fallen from the unprecedented levels following the COVID-19 pandemic.1 The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Manufacturers\u2019 Outlook Survey for fourth quarter of 2023 revealed that, in the last two years, 86.2% of respondents have worked to de-risk their supply chains.2 Many companies are now prioritizing a resilient yet efficient supply chain. They are working to optimize the balance between performance and cost by restructuring their supply chain. These approaches include expanding to locations in the United States, or to locations closer to end consumers, and also working more closely with free trade partners of the United States.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nIndustrial manufacturers are finding advantages in countries across North America and Asia. They are exploring both \u201cnearshoring\u201d options in Canada and Mexico and \u201creshoring\u201d options in the United States. The share of US trade in goods with China has declined from 21.2% in 2018 to 13.9% in 2023. While Mexico has overtaken China to become the lead US trading partner, accounting for a 15.4% share (figure 1), Mexican trade with China has simultaneously increased.3 Now, manufacturers are likely exploring ways to ensure that their Tier 2 and Tier 3 supply networks are sufficiently networked to reduce their raw material and key component exposure.\nOther nearshoring options such as Canada, as well as potential Asian trading partners like India, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, have experienced growth. This restructuring is occurring globally and is not exclusive to the United States, nor is it a North American phenomenon. In fact, at the end of 2023, 97% of companies surveyed in the Economist Impact\u2019s \u201cTrade in Transition 2024\u201d project stated they were reconfiguring their supply chains in some way, as compared to 92% in 2022.4\nThese changes beg the questions: What are industrial manufacturing and construction companies considering with respect to performance and cost as they restructure their supply chains? And how are they doing the restructuring?\nShare image\nOr copy link\nSupply chain efficiency is motivating industrial manufacturers to restructure their supply base\nAs global supply chains have normalized\u00a0following the pandemic, chief executive officers are likely beginning to shift their strategic focus toward profitable growth.5 Part of the strategy for many, for maintaining healthy margins, is rooted in reducing company exposure to supply chain disruption while employing cost reduction techniques and capitalizing on government policies supporting domestic growth.\nGeopolitical instability and disruptions keep the focus on delivery and lead times\nAs CEOs look to keep their company exposure low, their concerns over the indirect impacts of geopolitical instabilities on supply chains have grown.6 And, after a period of decline, the end of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 saw an uptick in supply chain challenges as a primary business issue for manufacturers (figure 2).7 This, in turn, has led to increased transit times worldwide.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nIndustry leaders expect that global shipping may experience up to 20-day delays in deliveries in the coming months.8 Deloitte\u2019s US economic forecast for the first quarter of 2024 suggests that the situation in the Red Sea may persist,9 potentially upending the progress made in lead times since 2022. In particular, the average lead time of production materials in April 2024 was 79 days. While this is a 21% reduction from the peak of 100 days reached in July 2022, it is still higher than 2019 levels, which averaged around 65 days (figure 3).10\nLonger lead times can threaten manufacturing processes, and ultimately business continuity, for companies across the value chain. In the face of recent disruptions, the Manufacturing Supplier Deliveries Index rose to 48.9 in April 2024 from 47 in December 2023.11 The increase in the index signals a slowdown in the delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations, largely due to raw material supply chains.12 While delivery performance showed a trend of significant improvement with average delivery decreases of 72.8 in 2021 to 57.3 in 2022 and 46 in 2023, it increased in the first quarter of 2024 to 49.7.13 This increase will likely motivate companies to maintain focus on resilience.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nSupply chain strategies to account for rising costs\nTo help reduce exposure to global disruptions and both maintain and boost margins, some manufacturers are looking to be strategic in their supply base restructuring by identifying and targeting specific components of a broader cost equation. Leading companies are exploring ways in which they can balance workforce requirements with labor costs and delivery times with shipping costs, all while ensuring the highest product quality.\nCompanies are still likely to heavily lean into labor costs as their main motivation for cost-based restructuring. This, of course, is not a new trend. In 1982, on average, US multinationals had 30% of their workforce abroad. Over the last several decades, companies have generally seen this percentage increase.14\nIn 2003, a Chinese employee in manufacturing made approximately 3% of their American counterpart while a Mexican employee made approximately 11%.15 As time progressed, Chinese manufacturing expertise increased and so too did accompanying wage rates. Between 2022 and 2023, a wage rate comparison reveals that a Chinese manufacturing worker makes the equivalent of approximately 26% of their American counterpart, while a Mexican worker makes approximately 14%.16 Today, workers in Malaysia and Thailand make approximately 1% and 15% of US hourly wages, respectively, and workers in India earn approximately 4-5% of US hourly wages.17\nThe inputs to the labor equation for companies have changed and so too have their supply chain practices. For instance, Mexico is currently proving to be a viable competitor to China as costs and trade policies are driving a growth of nearshoring for automotive and electronics manufacturers.18\nSome companies are taking a methodical approach to capitalizing on labor cost advantages by gradually restructuring their bases. In such a scenario, these companies can achieve labor cost efficiencies while adding resilience to their supply base through expansion.\nMany of the current cost-motivating factors are interesting from a labor arbitrage perspective. As the modern world of smart factories grows and expands, the role of labor costs will likely diminish as the entire cost equation changes. As organizations continue to incorporate automation and leverage sustainable technologies, they are likely to begin reconsidering the motivating factors for supply chain restructuring.\nFinally, the most recent supply chain disruptions have spotlighted the costs associated with shipping and logistics. As of February 1, 2024, the rate for shipping from China to the East Coast of the United States was US$6,589 forty-foot equivalent unit, a 193% rate increase since October 2023.19 Additionally, these disruptions are likely to have ripple effects down the road. The NAM manufacturers\u2019 outlook survey for the first quarter of 2024 indicated that raw material prices may increase by 2.38% over the next 12 months.20\nThe growing importance of industrial policy for profitable growth\nAmid the exposure to increased delivery times, differing labor costs, and higher transportation costs, many companies are already shaping their restructuring approaches to take advantage of evolving industrial policy. Governments across the globe are actively adapting policy to favor domestic industrial activity and consequently incentivizing reshoring and nearshoring activities. These industrial policies are likely to continue to accelerate changes in supply chains21 and could play a major role in driving decisions regarding restructuring in the coming years.\nPrivate fixed investment in manufacturing increased nearly 2.5 times in 2023 from 2021, to reach US$799.2 billion.22 As of September 2023, US$430 billion of this investment spike is attributed to several key pieces of US legislation\u2014specifically, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).23\nIn January 2024, the US Department of Defense unveiled its National Defense Industrial Strategy. One priority of this strategy is the development of resilient supply chains enabling the nation to securely acquire products, services, and technologies for defense applications. Such government strategies can facilitate the restructuring of supply chains to meet both current and future needs at speed, scale, and cost.24\nIn fact, according to data from the Reshoring Initiative 1H 2023 Report, the top reason companies reshore or conduct foreign direct investment (FDI) is government incentives.25 From free trade agreements and tariffs to tax incentives and subsidies, the United States and a host of other countries are putting policy in place to entice companies and ensure the growth of domestic regional supply chains.\nEconomic data indicates that free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement), are likely driving greater regionalization of supply chains as there are increased incentives for sourcing goods and materials in North America.\nSince USMCA\u2019s origination in 2020, FDI into North America has grown 134% to approximately US$219 billion.26 FDI in Mexico landed at nearly US$19 billion in the first quarter of 2023,\u00a0a 48% year-over-year increase.27 Of this investment, 53% was in the manufacturing sector (compared to 24% in the first quarter of 2022),28 which emerged as one of the top two industries for direct investment in both the United States and USMCA.29 Nearly half of the total FDI was led by North American companies from automotive, aerospace, electronics, and telecommunications.30\nInclusive of Mexico and Canada, the United States has free trade agreements with a total of 20 countries.31 These agreements are intended to provide opportunities for global industrial manufacturing and construction companies to benefit from reduced tariffs\u00a0on an array of goods and strengthen supply chains on the most critical items.32\nFor example, with the US-Japan Trade Agreement and the more recent agreement on strengthening critical mineral supply chains, the United States is encouraging companies to restructure their supply bases into Japan. These agreements provide companies access to more favorable tariffs for industrial goods such as machine tools and steam turbines and better access to tax incentives for mineral-based technologies.33\nFinally, governments may use tariffs as a lever to help encourage diversification away from certain markets, thereby driving restructuring activity. In combination with free trade agreements like the USMCA, these tariffs have likely led to global supply chain restructuring and new trade activity. Three years following the enactment of the USMCA, the total value of North American trade in 2023 had grown by nearly US$500 billion.34 At that point, North American trade exceeded US$1.57 trillion, placing Mexico and Canada as the top trade partners with the United States.35\nThe US government is incentivizing businesses across the industrial manufacturing and construction sector to reshore their most advanced operations with a number of tax and investment opportunities. Many of these incentives fall under bolstering critical minerals, green energy technologies, and advanced manufacturing.\nThe IRA, a US$370 billion investment program, demonstrates the US government\u2019s commitment to domestically advance clean technology manufacturing, ranging from clean energy and clean vehicles to sustainable construction materials and advanced manufacturing.36 This includes US$2.1 billion for the US General Services Administration to use materials and products with low embodied carbon37 and an advanced manufacturing tax credit to incentivize domestic production of solar and wind energy components, qualified battery components, and up to 50 critical minerals.38\nThe IRA opportunities range from direct funding to tax credits. These opportunities are attracting new investments in the United States. For example, in February 2023, Holcim Limited, used a US$1.29 billion purchase of a US roofing system company to expand its presence the United States.39\nSeparately, with the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, the US government committed US$52.7 billion of investments into domestic chip production and advanced semiconductor research and development.40 The legislation further incentivizes a push for companies in advanced manufacturing for semiconductor technology through a 25% tax credit on eligible capital investments.41\nThe impact in developing a domestic semiconductor supply chain was immediate as a number of chipmakers, including foreign companies, are building fabrication facilities. Leveraging incentives from the CHIPS Act, America\u2019s Intel Corporation announced plans to spend US$20 billion to build two fabrication plants in Ohio.42 Additionally, a Taiwanese chipmaker is building two fabrication plants in the United States43 in a move that not only enables greater access to customers but can also help de-risk supply chain operations.\nBeyond the United States, both Japan and India are using their own governments\u2019 subsidies to incentivize regional production of semiconductors. And much like in the United States, these incentives are resulting in investments.\nIn Japan, a major chipmaker is using significant subsidies from the Japanese government to help build two semiconductor fabrication plants.44 Further, a Taiwan-based foundry, in collaboration with a leading precision and electronics manufacturer from India, is utilizing Indian subsidies of approximately US$15 billion to expand its semiconductor fabrication. This expansion aims to satisfy local demand in India and build supply chain resilience for global end users.45\nCompanies deploy differentiated strategies to help achieve supply performance\nMany global industrial manufacturing and construction companies spent years employing resilience strategies like overbuying to help reduce production delays, often to the detriment of margins. Now they are employing everything from traditional strategies to advanced technologies in a quest to realize value in their supply chains.\nWhile many of these strategies are not new, recent external supply chain risks have made them a primary focus for industrial manufacturing and construction companies. These strategies can help ensure business continuity by reducing bottlenecks, balancing cost opportunities with innovation potential, and allowing access to the most favorable regulatory environments.\nTechniques to diversify sources and reduce concentration issue\nIndustrial manufacturing companies are using dual sourcing, or \u201csupplier + 1,\u201d to reduce their supply chain reliance on a single supplier or country. This is achieved by incorporating an additional supplier from the same or a different location to satisfy a portion of the supply requirement. According to a Gartner supply chain survey, 57% of industrial manufacturers with operations in China are considering the \u201csupplier + 1\u201d strategy.46\nIn some instances, companies are working to achieve extensive risk mitigation and diversification by employing a multi-sourcing strategy, where they employ three or more suppliers to satisfy a supply requirement. (To see how multi-sourcing is helping shape the advanced air mobility industry, see sidebar, \u201cEmerging industries have an opportunity to build resilient supply chains from scratch.\u201d)\nEmerging industries have an opportunity to build resilient supply chains from scratch\nEvolving industries like advanced air mobility have an opportunity to both develop and shape resilient, robust, and efficient supply chains of the future. Learning from electric vehicle industry experiences, Lilium, an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) manufacturer, is mitigating risks associated with battery production by adopting a multi-sourcing strategy.47\nFurther, Archer, another eVTOL manufacturer, has signed a Space Act Agreement with NASA to study high-performance battery cells for advanced air mobility and space applications. Archer anticipates that this study will drive progress in the evolving supply chain for electric aircraft.48\nTo mitigate the risks associated with quality and lead time, industrial manufacturing companies are gradually building capacity at new supplier locations while reducing capacity from an existing supplier. These approaches can help address business continuity challenges during uncertain times and diversify away from existing dependencies. Such measures can also enhance the overall capabilities of the particular destination country, setting the stage for future operations opportunities. Additionally, these strategies may provide companies greater access to end users or governmental incentives.\nA trifecta of restructuring options\nIn addition to expanding their supply bases through dual-or multi-sourcing strategies, industrial manufacturing companies are employing mergers and acquisitions (M&A), strategic partnerships, and new supplier investment agreements, and expanded internal capabilities to restructure and build resilience into their supply chains.\nHorizontal integration, by merging or acquiring other companies, can help companies expand their supply base as well as their customer base, while gaining access to new markets, increasing their market share, and potentially benefiting from economies of scale.\nVertical integration can be useful when manufacturers seek greater control of certain stages of the supply chain, from sourcing raw materials to delivering the final product or after-sales services. For instance, at the end of 2022, First Aviation Services Inc. acquired Associated Aircraft Manufacturing & Sales, Inc. (AAMSI). This move provided First Aviation the ability to access and integrate AAMSI\u2019s machining and electronics manufacturing operations into its supply chain.49 In the global market, AERO Vodochody AEROSPACE a.s. has bought one of the major suppliers of its new L-39NG aircraft, Technometra \u010cesk\u00fd Brod a.s.50\nAs M&A is typically capital intensive, some companies are exploring strategic partnerships and supplier investments to expand their supply bases. Strategic partnerships with new suppliers can facilitate shared strengths, mitigate risks, and are often accompanied by cost reductions and increased innovation. To ensure supply chain resilience, manufacturers may further invest in the growth and development of their suppliers. This investment can be in the form of technology transfers or financial investments.\nNew supplier investment agreements can mitigate risks with existing suppliers by enhancing internal capabilities and flexibility. These agreements can enable companies to address material flow and business continuity more readily.\u00a0(For considerations in the construction industry, see sidebar, \u201cThe construction industry may be able to emphasize collaboration and digital technologies to address supply chain issues.\u201d)\nThe construction industry may be able to emphasize collaboration and digital technologies to address supply chain issues\nConstruction input prices increased by 1.4% in February 2024, 0.4% in March 2024, and 0.5% in April 2024, with overall construction costs remaining approximately 2.3% higher than the previous year, primarily due to persistent inflation, energy costs, and escalating supply chain issues. Further, as of April 2024, the prices of crude petroleum, unprocessed energy materials, iron and steel, fabricated structural metal products, and steel mill products have surged by more than 50% compared to February 2020.51\nMoving forward, construction companies can collaborate closely with suppliers to understand risks well in advance, seek alternative sourcing options, and implement digital technologies. In the short term, some construction companies (particularly global companies) are considering local vendors for sourcing options. Additionally, while typically project-specific and not a historical trend, construction firms may purchase supplies across projects to unlock more competitive pricing by sourcing common materials from a smaller, consolidated supply base.\nImplementing digital supply chain technologies can allow construction companies to connect with suppliers in real time and can provide greater visibility and control over the supply chain by streamlining internal processes and improving overall efficiency. These proactive approaches can potentially address downtime during disruptions and manage lead time, finances, and customer confidence.\nFinally, industrial manufacturing companies are, in a sense, expanding their supply base by making substantial investments in their own capabilities. On the one hand, companies are adding new manufacturing sites or capacity to meet potential demand. On the other, they are enhancing their product capabilities and demand responsiveness by investing in new equipment and technologies, including advanced machinery such as 3D printers and specialized machines.\nEnhancing product capabilities goes beyond hardware as companies are introducing an array of software solutions. Industrial manufacturers are using technologies and digital solutions to enhance operational and supply chain resilience and increase visibility across the value chain.\nManufacturers are building digital twins of the supply chain for essential components, which can assist in identifying alternative suppliers or boosting robustness and agility to reduce dependency. As supply chains restructure, manufacturers are likely to find digitalization critical to help ensure visibility throughout supplier tiers. Deloitte\u2019s 2023 \u201cExploring the industrial metaverse\u201d revealed that 21% of those companies surveyed are incorporating metaverse technologies to improve their supply chain ecosystems.52\nDiving into specific technological applications, a study conducted by Augury revealed that supply chain management and optimization is the top use case for artificial intelligence, as reported by 41% of surveyed respondents.53 Further, the 2024 Material Handling Industry Annual Industry Report showed that respondents identified logistics, shipping and transportation, supplier selection and due diligence, and inventory management as the top three applications of AI.54\nThe modernization of existing facilities, incorporation of advanced technologies (both hardware and software), and support for suppliers to meet current demand are strategic moves that can help strengthen the supply chain for manufacturers and suppliers. (For thoughts on the aerospace and defense industry, see sidebar, \u201cThe aerospace and defense industry may further embrace agile supply chains digital technologies to meet projected demand increase.\u201d)\nThe aerospace and defense industry may further embrace agile supply chains digital technologies to meet projected demand increase\nThe aerospace industry faced significant challenges in meeting post-pandemic demand due to supply chain disruptions. Suppliers may need to be more agile moving forward to capture demand and may consider investing in emerging technologies and smart factory solutions to address supply chain challenges and optimize production capacity.\nInvesting in digital technologies can also provide greater supply chain visibility, foster innovation, and strengthen stakeholder relationships. These investments could improve efficiency and competitiveness, ultimately leading to cost and operational benefits.\nThe next phase of supply chains: Maximizing resilience while maintaining margins\nThe restructuring of the industrial manufacturing supply base reflects the sector\u2019s resilience and adaptability, particularly in the face of external uncertainties. Companies across the sector are continuously seeking opportunities to maximize resilience while keeping margins high. They are finding motivations for restructuring through delivery performance, cost reductions, and government incentives, all aimed at profitable growth.\nAs technology continues to advance, industrial manufacturing and construction companies are maintaining one eye on the future while working to ensure their supply systems of the past. Many new government policies are incentivizing advanced technology or products for future demand. However, these companies should maintain their procurement processes for legacy items. To do this, industrial manufacturing and construction companies are leveraging a multitude of strategies, ranging from diversifying their suppliers and seeking new agreements to bringing capabilities in-house and implementing digital technologies, all in an effort to help create resilient and efficient supply chains.\nChange your Analytics and performance cookie settings\nto access this feature.\nBY\nJim Kilpatrick\nCanadian Consumer Products Industry Leader\nCanada\nJim is the Global Supply Chain & Network Operations Leader for Deloitte Consulting, and the leader for Consumer Products Industry in Canada.

      "Factory Ordering a Car? These Are Wait Times We\u2019re Seeing in 2024\nFactory Ordering a Car? These Are Wait Times We\u2019re Seeing in 2024\nWhat vehicle are you interested in?\nWhat's your zip code?\nWe track new car inventory monthly, and it\u2019s been encouraging to see automakers like Ford and Toyota having more cars shipped to dealers. Still, automakers are selling every car they can make. With that said, more drivers are placing factory orders for vehicle builds that might not arrive until well into next year, or worse. Here\u2019s how long car buyers are waiting for the vehicle they want.\nImportant note: These times are strictly for factory ordered cars. Many of these models are now available on dealer lots.\nKia and Hyundai Wait Times\nHyundai Motors owns 51% of Kia, and the two Korean automakers have grown increasingly close over the past decade. Today, many of their vehicles share components, and therefore have been similarly impacted by supply chain constraints.\nThese are the factory order wait times our team of Car Coaches is hearing in 2024:\nSubaru Wait Times\nRight now, buyers placing orders for a Subaru are regularly being told that the wait time for delivery will be between one and four months, and in some cases longer. Subaru was hit hard by the chip shortage, and has yet to pull out of the slump. These are the Subaru factory wait times we\u2019re hearing today:\nToyota Factory Order Wait Times\nHow long you should expect to wait depends on the Toyota model and spec that you\u2019ve ordered. For Toyota hybrids and plug-in hybrids, wait times are much longer. For the Toyota RAV4 Prime and Prius Prime, wait times are longest.\nIn 2024, these are common Toyota factory order wait times our team is hearing:\n4Runner: 2-4 monthsGR86: 5-8 monthsCamry: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsCorolla: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsHighlander: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsPrius: 4-6 months / Prime 8+ monthsRAV4: 2-4 months / Hybrid or Prime 8+ monthsSequoia: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsSienna: 2-5 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsTacoma: 2-4 monthsTundra: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsVenza: 2-4 months\nHonda Wait Times\nOn average, Honda factory orders placed today can expect a four month wait before delivery. For the popular, newly redesigned Civic, the wait is more likely to be six months. Honda has been hit particularly hard by the chip shortage and pandemic-related disruptions. Japanese automakers were even dealt a blow from an earthquake earlier this year.\nThese are the Honda factory order wait times we\u2019re seeing in 2024:\nAccord: ImmediateCivic: 1-2 monthsCR-V: 1-2 monthsCR-V Hybrid: 3+ monthsOdyssey: 2-4 monthsPilot: 1-2 monthsRidgeline: Immediate\nIn 2024, the Honda Prologue electric crossover will arrive. Pre-orders are expected to open soon, so keep an eye out for that if you want to be first on the list for this GM-built Honda EV. It will qualify for at least half of the new EV tax credit.\nSee which new electric vehicles qualify for the new EV tax credit\nRam and Jeep Wait Times\nFor Jeep and Ram factory orders, wait times depend on what model and trim you want. Waiting three to four months for a Ram 1500 or Jeep Grand Cherokee is a lot easier to swallow if you\u2019re getting a better deal with incentives.\nThese are the Ram truck factory wait times our team is encountering in 2024:\n1500: 1-3 months2500: 2-4 months3500: 2-4 months\nFord Factory Orders Wait Times Faring Slightly Better\nThese are the Ford factory order wait times we\u2019re seeing this year:\nBronco: 3+ monthsBronco Sport: 1-3 monthsF-150: 1-3 monthsF-250: 2-3 monthsF-350: 2-3 monthsF-450: 2-6 monthsMustang: ImmediateMustang Mach E: 1-3 months\nHybrids, Plug-In Hybrids and EVs Have the Longest Wait Times\nWe\u2019re seeing wait times for popular hybrid vehicles extending up to one year for several automakers. It\u2019s easy to forget that gas prices were over $5.00/gallon nationally just a few months ago, and that caused a massive spike in orders for more fuel-efficient vehicles.\nNot only is demand higher, but OEMs are rationing their supplies of semiconductor chips and in some cases, even batteries.\nIn a silver lining to the confusing new EV tax credit, America will soon have its first used EV tax credit. The used EV tax credit began in January 2023, but only used EVs under $25,000 will qualify (if sold by a dealer, and the buyer meets income restrictions.) Learn more about the used EV tax credit and eligibility here.\nTesla Wait Times\nTesla regularly updates wait times for the Model Y, Model 3, Model S and Model X. As of 2024, here are Tesla wait times as shared on Tesla.com. Note that there are many possible configurations that affect estimated delivery dates, so check Tesla\u2019s configurator for the most accurate estimate.\nTaking Delivery After a Long Wait? Beware of the Infamous Dirt Mountain\nAlthough Ford has somewhat improved factory order wait times in recent months, customers are still taking delivery of Broncos that had spent months waiting around at the so-called Dirt Mountain in Michigan. How could that impact those taking delivery of their beloved Ford Bronco? Field mice.\nAnytime vehicles sit idly for months at a time, there\u2019s the risk of rodents making the car their home. Before taking delivery, have all wires under the hood checked for signs of gnawing rodents. Ford even admitted in their earnings report that their number one challenge right now is quality control, and the infamous Dirt Mountain issues are certainly part of that. Of course these new vehicles are under warranty, but you\u2019d hate to be left stranded with power failure shortly after driving your new car home.\nGet the most when you sell your car.\nFree Car Buying Help Is Here!\nReady to outsmart the dealerships?

Based on current market conditions and trends (which may be quite different in January as used car prices begin to fall), I expect PHEV and full BEV prices to remain elevated while used ICE vehicles fall. With a price cap of $25k built into the used EV and PHEV tax credit, expect to see a lot of used, older PHEVs and EVs for $24,900.\nI ordered a Ford Expedition in March, it\u2019s still not even built. My friend ordered a Dodge Charger in August, it was built last week and is in transit for delivery. How can Ford be running 8 MONTHS slower than Dodge??? What the heck are they doing over there at Ford?\nWe just ordered a 2023 Ford Escape Platinum Hybrid FWD.\nThe dealer quoted us a wait of just 8-10 weeks.\nWe\u2019ll see how it goes.\nI called the marketing department to see if they have any photos available, as the ordering process still shows the 2022 model.\nAll I\u2019ve seen so far is spy videos on YouTube.\nIf you have any other ideas on how to find what it actually looks like, I\u2019d be thankful.\nThanks for sharing! Not sure what it looks like, but I think it\u2019s a good choice. Get the agreed price in writing from the sales manager!\nRegarding Ford Wait Times: I\u2019m not sure that 4-6 months is accurate. I ordered a Bronco on 22 December 2021 and my vehicle started production recently on 11 October 2022. With final assembly and then delivery to my dealer, I\u2019m looking at about 11 months wait time in total. In my production week alone, 44 fellow Bronco have self-reported wait times from 200-400 days since they ordered their Bronco\u2019s. While Ford does seem to be working hard to complete Manufacturing Year (MY) 22 builds, we are far from 4-6 weeks away f wait time.\nThanks for sharing! Our estimate is for new factory orders placed today. It will vary from model to model, but this is our estimate from the information we\u2019ve gathered from recent buyers placing orders.\nI think the estimate for US Subaru factory orders are way off. I placed an order for an Outback at the beginning of August and have just learned that it has reached the first point in the US. It means it has just been built and might be at the railyards for shipping to the westcoast\nof Canada. Might get by end of Jan. 2024. So possibly 6 months wait. I understand from the dealer that it is similar for other models built in the US.\nSubmit a Comment Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Connect with us anytime, anywhere.\nTop 10 supply chain risks that companies face\nSupply chain risks represent a broad spectrum, from compliance and cyber issues to operational concerns and environmental risk. To enhance supply chain resilience, it\u2019s critical for companies to understand and have visibility over the most frequent and severe problems that can impact a supplier\u2019s ability to provide the goods and service the business needs. These challenges include:\nHere\u2019s a closer look at each of these concerns and the supply chain risk management strategies that can help to mitigate disruption.\nAs risks become more complicated and interconnected, supply chain professionals must identify and address top challenges to ensure resilience. Today, among the top supply chain risks are:\n#1: Poor Supplier Performance\nSupplier performance holds a huge potential for supply chain disruption.\nA supplier\u2019s financial health is often a reliable predictor of their performance. However, other factors should be considered when assessing both the internal and extraneous factors that may impact their performance, including:\nMitigation Strategies\nThe most important way to protect your company against this potential risk is to use predictive analytics to identify a supplier\u2019s declining financial health before it impacts yours. It\u2019s also important to maintain relationships with alternative suppliers, ideally in other parts of the world, to diversify and potentially reduce environmental risk. Finally, companies should invest in inventory management techniques and keep buffer stocks on hand to prevent delays in case of supplier performance issues.\n#2: Demand Planning Complexity\nDuring the pandemic, demand patterns changed as people were confined to their homes. Planning for pent-up demand was easier when companies operated on a just-in-time basis. Now, however, companies need to buy more than they need immediately \u2014 but they may not know exactly how much more.\nMitigation Strategies\nInvesting in more sophisticated demand planning solutions that move away from traditional algorithms tied to historical demand patterns to those that focus on predictive analytics and other advanced methodologies.\nAs this may be a longer-term strategy based on significant investments required, there are also some practical, short term areas that can create big improvements such as:\nReviewing vendor set up logic and accuracy\nAdjusting safety stock levels with a more granular application towards strategic and under-performing supplier and focusing on lead time monitoring and more frequent updates to system settings\n#3: Global Labor Shortage\nIncreased competition for skilled labor means that companies might not have the resources to build a product or deliver a service in time. Additionally, they might struggle to find the skills needed to effectively assess, monitor, and mitigate supplier risk.\nMitigation Strategies\nUnderstand labor shortage patterns and how they relate to global supply chain risk. From there, it\u2019s easier to identify and address workforce problems, implement solutions like retraining, or adjust hiring practices.\n#4: Rising Inflation\nHigh inflation creates unpredictable price increases, making it more difficult to effectively plan and manage cashflows. It also causes complications and delays when negotiating prices with suppliers.\nMitigation Strategies\nDiversify supplier relationships to help distribute rising costs away from your own operations. It\u2019s also critical to understand potential disruptions to your finances and plan accordingly.\n#5: A Volatile Global Economy\nPost-pandemic economic uncertainty has led many to fear a global recession. Companies used to increase inventories to ensure steady production \u2014 but if the market contracts, companies might have unsold inventories at the peak of production cycles.\nMitigation Strategies\nDo what you can to understand the global supply chain as a whole and how suppliers in different areas impact (and are impacted by) economic conditions. Focus on managing the financial risks you have direct control over so you\u2019re protected in case of other disruptions.\n#6: Complex Sanctions and Regulations\nEven before 2023, new sanctions were being imposed every day. Keeping up with sanctions is challenging: Firms must know suppliers\u2019 ultimate beneficial owners, directors, and shareholders to comply and prevent bad actors from undermining their supply chain.\nMitigation Strategies\nView supply chain risk management through a regulatory lens. Understand requirements, expectations, and penalties relevant to your industry, and take timely action to update relationships or choose alternate suppliers if necessary.\n#7: Geopolitical Risk\nOngoing global political events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and China\u2019s zero-Covid policy have heavily disrupted global supply chains. As conditions and relationships grow more complicated, the entire supply chain will shift to keep up.\nMitigation Strategies\nFirms need both onshore and offshore alternative suppliers to ensure they have options in case of disruption. Analyze the costs and benefits of these sites to understand the domestic and international affairs where potential suppliers are based.\n#8: Reputational Risk\nThis can result from many risk factors. One such driver can be unsatisfactory environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related practices among suppliers \u2013 including poor working conditions and labor relations.\nMitigation Strategies\nCompanies can begin by understanding possible incidents through audits and reputational monitoring. Use this information to consider external risks and their potential impact on your overall supply chain. Then, decide how to mitigate any risk areas identified \u2013 by engaging with suppliers directly or, in severe cases or where resolutions cannot be found, by switching suppliers.\n#9: Natural Disasters and Climate Risk\nSupply chains are vulnerable to property damage and business interruption due to natural disasters, but they also present opportunities to meet sustainability targets. Firms need to quantify the financial and operational impact in real time and assess site-specific risks.\nMitigation Strategies\nUse climate data to assess how a supplier\u2019s activities and the location of its facilities expose you to risk. As you learn more about your partnerships, base inventory planning decisions on areas or suppliers with the highest risk potential.\n#10: Cyber Risk\nThe increased threat of cyberattacks has made paramount companies\u2019 understanding of both their own cybersecurity protocols and those of their suppliers. Any organization with access to the company\u2019s network or systems can pose a risk.\nMitigation Strategies\nStart by reviewing system access, information sharing permissions, and the extent of the information being shared. Analyze any and all data sharing habits with suppliers that can present challenges, if managed incorrectly.\nUnderstanding Supply Chain Risk\nAlthough it\u2019s helpful to understand the top supply chain risks in any given year, it\u2019s far more important to know the underlying causes, relationships, effects, and explanations. Even as individual factors shift and impacts take different forms, these foundational principles are always relevant \u2014 and always useful in supply chain management.\nCauses\nThe specific causes of supply chain risk may change, but they tend to align with patterns. For example, failure to follow or update certain procedures can lead to ESG, reputational, cyber, and other risks; poor global relationships can complicate geopolitical, economic, and sustainability risks; even well-meaning human error can cause cascading effects. It\u2019s important to understand these patterns and their underlying logic so you can identify them in different forms.\nRelationships\nIt\u2019s often difficult to separate one kind of risk from another because today\u2019s interconnected supply chains don\u2019t lend themselves to neat compartmentalization. This can complicate risk management \u2014 but also empower it. When supply chain leaders are called to treat risks more holistically, it\u2019s easier to identify and capitalize on these logical relationships, ensuring that fewer issues are overlooked or unaddressed.\nEffects\nThe effects of supply chain disruption can shift depending on the market, industry, and type of risk \u2014 but nonetheless, they can generally be sorted into the same categories:\nDelays: Even small supply chain challenges can cause delays that impact workflows, projects, budgets, and outcomes down the line.\nShortages: When a supplier has performance or timing issues, they can cause shortages of raw material and specific products, which impacts availability in the wider market.\nPrice disruption: Shortages often lead to increased costs for everyone in the supply chain, even end consumers.\nLoss of reputation: Whether it\u2019s a small, internal supply chain risk or a public ESG failure, the effects of disruption can lead to reputational impacts that may not be easy to remedy.\nPrioritization\nWhile individual risks and their effects might shift, it\u2019s always critical to have a plan. Often, this means relying on a prioritization framework \u2014 a flexible but well-defined approach to supply chain challenges that helps you analyze potential outcomes and address problems accordingly. This approach should be customized based on the risk types that are most impactful to your organization\u2019s performance and objectives; these values may change over time, but should always relate to specific risk management goals.\nEqually important is the understanding that not all participants of a supply chain or industry have the same risk appetite or priorities. This means two things: First, you needn\u2019t base your approach on your peers\u2019; and second, you may find that your needs conflict with those of a particular supply chain partner, which may cause friction. When you\u2019re aware of this possibility, you can take steps to mitigate delays or disruptions without compromising your own needs.\nLearn More About Supply Chain Risks and Solutions\nAs global economies and supply chains become more complex, so do the risks that impact them.

For many industrial manufacturers, the response of the supply network to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical challenges, and natural disasters thrust supply chain resilience into the limelight. But the pendulum appears to be swinging back, with costs and margin pressures once again at the forefront as companies reevaluate their supply chains.\nAs of early 2024, supply chain pressures have fallen from the unprecedented levels following the COVID-19 pandemic.1 The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Manufacturers\u2019 Outlook Survey for fourth quarter of 2023 revealed that, in the last two years, 86.2% of respondents have worked to de-risk their supply chains.2 Many companies are now prioritizing a resilient yet efficient supply chain. They are working to optimize the balance between performance and cost by restructuring their supply chain. These approaches include expanding to locations in the United States, or to locations closer to end consumers, and also working more closely with free trade partners of the United States.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nIndustrial manufacturers are finding advantages in countries across North America and Asia. They are exploring both \u201cnearshoring\u201d options in Canada and Mexico and \u201creshoring\u201d options in the United States. The share of US trade in goods with China has declined from 21.2% in 2018 to 13.9% in 2023. While Mexico has overtaken China to become the lead US trading partner, accounting for a 15.4% share (figure 1), Mexican trade with China has simultaneously increased.3 Now, manufacturers are likely exploring ways to ensure that their Tier 2 and Tier 3 supply networks are sufficiently networked to reduce their raw material and key component exposure.\nOther nearshoring options such as Canada, as well as potential Asian trading partners like India, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, have experienced growth. This restructuring is occurring globally and is not exclusive to the United States, nor is it a North American phenomenon. In fact, at the end of 2023, 97% of companies surveyed in the Economist Impact\u2019s \u201cTrade in Transition 2024\u201d project stated they were reconfiguring their supply chains in some way, as compared to 92% in 2022.4\nThese changes beg the questions: What are industrial manufacturing and construction companies considering with respect to performance and cost as they restructure their supply chains? And how are they doing the restructuring?\nShare image\nOr copy link\nSupply chain efficiency is motivating industrial manufacturers to restructure their supply base\nAs global supply chains have normalized\u00a0following the pandemic, chief executive officers are likely beginning to shift their strategic focus toward profitable growth.5 Part of the strategy for many, for maintaining healthy margins, is rooted in reducing company exposure to supply chain disruption while employing cost reduction techniques and capitalizing on government policies supporting domestic growth.\nGeopolitical instability and disruptions keep the focus on delivery and lead times\nAs CEOs look to keep their company exposure low, their concerns over the indirect impacts of geopolitical instabilities on supply chains have grown.6 And, after a period of decline, the end of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 saw an uptick in supply chain challenges as a primary business issue for manufacturers (figure 2).7 This, in turn, has led to increased transit times worldwide.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nIndustry leaders expect that global shipping may experience up to 20-day delays in deliveries in the coming months.8 Deloitte\u2019s US economic forecast for the first quarter of 2024 suggests that the situation in the Red Sea may persist,9 potentially upending the progress made in lead times since 2022. In particular, the average lead time of production materials in April 2024 was 79 days. While this is a 21% reduction from the peak of 100 days reached in July 2022, it is still higher than 2019 levels, which averaged around 65 days (figure 3).10\nLonger lead times can threaten manufacturing processes, and ultimately business continuity, for companies across the value chain. In the face of recent disruptions, the Manufacturing Supplier Deliveries Index rose to 48.9 in April 2024 from 47 in December 2023.11 The increase in the index signals a slowdown in the delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations, largely due to raw material supply chains.12 While delivery performance showed a trend of significant improvement with average delivery decreases of 72.8 in 2021 to 57.3 in 2022 and 46 in 2023, it increased in the first quarter of 2024 to 49.7.13 This increase will likely motivate companies to maintain focus on resilience.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nSupply chain strategies to account for rising costs\nTo help reduce exposure to global disruptions and both maintain and boost margins, some manufacturers are looking to be strategic in their supply base restructuring by identifying and targeting specific components of a broader cost equation. Leading companies are exploring ways in which they can balance workforce requirements with labor costs and delivery times with shipping costs, all while ensuring the highest product quality.\nCompanies are still likely to heavily lean into labor costs as their main motivation for cost-based restructuring. This, of course, is not a new trend. In 1982, on average, US multinationals had 30% of their workforce abroad. Over the last several decades, companies have generally seen this percentage increase.14\nIn 2003, a Chinese employee in manufacturing made approximately 3% of their American counterpart while a Mexican employee made approximately 11%.15 As time progressed, Chinese manufacturing expertise increased and so too did accompanying wage rates. Between 2022 and 2023, a wage rate comparison reveals that a Chinese manufacturing worker makes the equivalent of approximately 26% of their American counterpart, while a Mexican worker makes approximately 14%.16 Today, workers in Malaysia and Thailand make approximately 1% and 15% of US hourly wages, respectively, and workers in India earn approximately 4-5% of US hourly wages.17\nThe inputs to the labor equation for companies have changed and so too have their supply chain practices. For instance, Mexico is currently proving to be a viable competitor to China as costs and trade policies are driving a growth of nearshoring for automotive and electronics manufacturers.18\nSome companies are taking a methodical approach to capitalizing on labor cost advantages by gradually restructuring their bases. In such a scenario, these companies can achieve labor cost efficiencies while adding resilience to their supply base through expansion.\nMany of the current cost-motivating factors are interesting from a labor arbitrage perspective. As the modern world of smart factories grows and expands, the role of labor costs will likely diminish as the entire cost equation changes. As organizations continue to incorporate automation and leverage sustainable technologies, they are likely to begin reconsidering the motivating factors for supply chain restructuring.\nFinally, the most recent supply chain disruptions have spotlighted the costs associated with shipping and logistics. As of February 1, 2024, the rate for shipping from China to the East Coast of the United States was US$6,589 forty-foot equivalent unit, a 193% rate increase since October 2023.19 Additionally, these disruptions are likely to have ripple effects down the road. The NAM manufacturers\u2019 outlook survey for the first quarter of 2024 indicated that raw material prices may increase by 2.38% over the next 12 months.20\nThe growing importance of industrial policy for profitable growth\nAmid the exposure to increased delivery times, differing labor costs, and higher transportation costs, many companies are already shaping their restructuring approaches to take advantage of evolving industrial policy. Governments across the globe are actively adapting policy to favor domestic industrial activity and consequently incentivizing reshoring and nearshoring activities. These industrial policies are likely to continue to accelerate changes in supply chains21 and could play a major role in driving decisions regarding restructuring in the coming years.\nPrivate fixed investment in manufacturing increased nearly 2.5 times in 2023 from 2021, to reach US$799.2 billion.22 As of September 2023, US$430 billion of this investment spike is attributed to several key pieces of US legislation\u2014specifically, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).23\nIn January 2024, the US Department of Defense unveiled its National Defense Industrial Strategy. One priority of this strategy is the development of resilient supply chains enabling the nation to securely acquire products, services, and technologies for defense applications. Such government strategies can facilitate the restructuring of supply chains to meet both current and future needs at speed, scale, and cost.24\nIn fact, according to data from the Reshoring Initiative 1H 2023 Report, the top reason companies reshore or conduct foreign direct investment (FDI) is government incentives.25 From free trade agreements and tariffs to tax incentives and subsidies, the United States and a host of other countries are putting policy in place to entice companies and ensure the growth of domestic regional supply chains.\nEconomic data indicates that free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement), are likely driving greater regionalization of supply chains as there are increased incentives for sourcing goods and materials in North America.\nSince USMCA\u2019s origination in 2020, FDI into North America has grown 134% to approximately US$219 billion.26 FDI in Mexico landed at nearly US$19 billion in the first quarter of 2023,\u00a0a 48% year-over-year increase.27 Of this investment, 53% was in the manufacturing sector (compared to 24% in the first quarter of 2022),28 which emerged as one of the top two industries for direct investment in both the United States and USMCA.29 Nearly half of the total FDI was led by North American companies from automotive, aerospace, electronics, and telecommunications.30\nInclusive of Mexico and Canada, the United States has free trade agreements with a total of 20 countries.31 These agreements are intended to provide opportunities for global industrial manufacturing and construction companies to benefit from reduced tariffs\u00a0on an array of goods and strengthen supply chains on the most critical items.32\nFor example, with the US-Japan Trade Agreement and the more recent agreement on strengthening critical mineral supply chains, the United States is encouraging companies to restructure their supply bases into Japan. These agreements provide companies access to more favorable tariffs for industrial goods such as machine tools and steam turbines and better access to tax incentives for mineral-based technologies.33\nFinally, governments may use tariffs as a lever to help encourage diversification away from certain markets, thereby driving restructuring activity. In combination with free trade agreements like the USMCA, these tariffs have likely led to global supply chain restructuring and new trade activity. Three years following the enactment of the USMCA, the total value of North American trade in 2023 had grown by nearly US$500 billion.34 At that point, North American trade exceeded US$1.57 trillion, placing Mexico and Canada as the top trade partners with the United States.35\nThe US government is incentivizing businesses across the industrial manufacturing and construction sector to reshore their most advanced operations with a number of tax and investment opportunities. Many of these incentives fall under bolstering critical minerals, green energy technologies, and advanced manufacturing.\nThe IRA, a US$370 billion investment program, demonstrates the US government\u2019s commitment to domestically advance clean technology manufacturing, ranging from clean energy and clean vehicles to sustainable construction materials and advanced manufacturing.36 This includes US$2.1 billion for the US General Services Administration to use materials and products with low embodied carbon37 and an advanced manufacturing tax credit to incentivize domestic production of solar and wind energy components, qualified battery components, and up to 50 critical minerals.38\nThe IRA opportunities range from direct funding to tax credits. These opportunities are attracting new investments in the United States. For example, in February 2023, Holcim Limited, used a US$1.29 billion purchase of a US roofing system company to expand its presence the United States.39\nSeparately, with the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, the US government committed US$52.7 billion of investments into domestic chip production and advanced semiconductor research and development.40 The legislation further incentivizes a push for companies in advanced manufacturing for semiconductor technology through a 25% tax credit on eligible capital investments.41\nThe impact in developing a domestic semiconductor supply chain was immediate as a number of chipmakers, including foreign companies, are building fabrication facilities. Leveraging incentives from the CHIPS Act, America\u2019s Intel Corporation announced plans to spend US$20 billion to build two fabrication plants in Ohio.42 Additionally, a Taiwanese chipmaker is building two fabrication plants in the United States43 in a move that not only enables greater access to customers but can also help de-risk supply chain operations.\nBeyond the United States, both Japan and India are using their own governments\u2019 subsidies to incentivize regional production of semiconductors. And much like in the United States, these incentives are resulting in investments.\nIn Japan, a major chipmaker is using significant subsidies from the Japanese government to help build two semiconductor fabrication plants.44 Further, a Taiwan-based foundry, in collaboration with a leading precision and electronics manufacturer from India, is utilizing Indian subsidies of approximately US$15 billion to expand its semiconductor fabrication. This expansion aims to satisfy local demand in India and build supply chain resilience for global end users.45\nCompanies deploy differentiated strategies to help achieve supply performance\nMany global industrial manufacturing and construction companies spent years employing resilience strategies like overbuying to help reduce production delays, often to the detriment of margins. Now they are employing everything from traditional strategies to advanced technologies in a quest to realize value in their supply chains.\nWhile many of these strategies are not new, recent external supply chain risks have made them a primary focus for industrial manufacturing and construction companies. These strategies can help ensure business continuity by reducing bottlenecks, balancing cost opportunities with innovation potential, and allowing access to the most favorable regulatory environments.\nTechniques to diversify sources and reduce concentration issue\nIndustrial manufacturing companies are using dual sourcing, or \u201csupplier + 1,\u201d to reduce their supply chain reliance on a single supplier or country. This is achieved by incorporating an additional supplier from the same or a different location to satisfy a portion of the supply requirement. According to a Gartner supply chain survey, 57% of industrial manufacturers with operations in China are considering the \u201csupplier + 1\u201d strategy.46\nIn some instances, companies are working to achieve extensive risk mitigation and diversification by employing a multi-sourcing strategy, where they employ three or more suppliers to satisfy a supply requirement. (To see how multi-sourcing is helping shape the advanced air mobility industry, see sidebar, \u201cEmerging industries have an opportunity to build resilient supply chains from scratch.\u201d)\nEmerging industries have an opportunity to build resilient supply chains from scratch\nEvolving industries like advanced air mobility have an opportunity to both develop and shape resilient, robust, and efficient supply chains of the future. Learning from electric vehicle industry experiences, Lilium, an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) manufacturer, is mitigating risks associated with battery production by adopting a multi-sourcing strategy.47\nFurther, Archer, another eVTOL manufacturer, has signed a Space Act Agreement with NASA to study high-performance battery cells for advanced air mobility and space applications. Archer anticipates that this study will drive progress in the evolving supply chain for electric aircraft.48\nTo mitigate the risks associated with quality and lead time, industrial manufacturing companies are gradually building capacity at new supplier locations while reducing capacity from an existing supplier. These approaches can help address business continuity challenges during uncertain times and diversify away from existing dependencies. Such measures can also enhance the overall capabilities of the particular destination country, setting the stage for future operations opportunities. Additionally, these strategies may provide companies greater access to end users or governmental incentives.\nA trifecta of restructuring options\nIn addition to expanding their supply bases through dual-or multi-sourcing strategies, industrial manufacturing companies are employing mergers and acquisitions (M&A), strategic partnerships, and new supplier investment agreements, and expanded internal capabilities to restructure and build resilience into their supply chains.\nHorizontal integration, by merging or acquiring other companies, can help companies expand their supply base as well as their customer base, while gaining access to new markets, increasing their market share, and potentially benefiting from economies of scale.\nVertical integration can be useful when manufacturers seek greater control of certain stages of the supply chain, from sourcing raw materials to delivering the final product or after-sales services. For instance, at the end of 2022, First Aviation Services Inc. acquired Associated Aircraft Manufacturing & Sales, Inc. (AAMSI). This move provided First Aviation the ability to access and integrate AAMSI\u2019s machining and electronics manufacturing operations into its supply chain.49 In the global market, AERO Vodochody AEROSPACE a.s. has bought one of the major suppliers of its new L-39NG aircraft, Technometra \u010cesk\u00fd Brod a.s.50\nAs M&A is typically capital intensive, some companies are exploring strategic partnerships and supplier investments to expand their supply bases. Strategic partnerships with new suppliers can facilitate shared strengths, mitigate risks, and are often accompanied by cost reductions and increased innovation. To ensure supply chain resilience, manufacturers may further invest in the growth and development of their suppliers. This investment can be in the form of technology transfers or financial investments.\nNew supplier investment agreements can mitigate risks with existing suppliers by enhancing internal capabilities and flexibility. These agreements can enable companies to address material flow and business continuity more readily.\u00a0(For considerations in the construction industry, see sidebar, \u201cThe construction industry may be able to emphasize collaboration and digital technologies to address supply chain issues.\u201d)\nThe construction industry may be able to emphasize collaboration and digital technologies to address supply chain issues\nConstruction input prices increased by 1.4% in February 2024, 0.4% in March 2024, and 0.5% in April 2024, with overall construction costs remaining approximately 2.3% higher than the previous year, primarily due to persistent inflation, energy costs, and escalating supply chain issues. Further, as of April 2024, the prices of crude petroleum, unprocessed energy materials, iron and steel, fabricated structural metal products, and steel mill products have surged by more than 50% compared to February 2020.51\nMoving forward, construction companies can collaborate closely with suppliers to understand risks well in advance, seek alternative sourcing options, and implement digital technologies. In the short term, some construction companies (particularly global companies) are considering local vendors for sourcing options. Additionally, while typically project-specific and not a historical trend, construction firms may purchase supplies across projects to unlock more competitive pricing by sourcing common materials from a smaller, consolidated supply base.\nImplementing digital supply chain technologies can allow construction companies to connect with suppliers in real time and can provide greater visibility and control over the supply chain by streamlining internal processes and improving overall efficiency. These proactive approaches can potentially address downtime during disruptions and manage lead time, finances, and customer confidence.\nFinally, industrial manufacturing companies are, in a sense, expanding their supply base by making substantial investments in their own capabilities. On the one hand, companies are adding new manufacturing sites or capacity to meet potential demand. On the other, they are enhancing their product capabilities and demand responsiveness by investing in new equipment and technologies, including advanced machinery such as 3D printers and specialized machines.\nEnhancing product capabilities goes beyond hardware as companies are introducing an array of software solutions. Industrial manufacturers are using technologies and digital solutions to enhance operational and supply chain resilience and increase visibility across the value chain.\nManufacturers are building digital twins of the supply chain for essential components, which can assist in identifying alternative suppliers or boosting robustness and agility to reduce dependency. As supply chains restructure, manufacturers are likely to find digitalization critical to help ensure visibility throughout supplier tiers. Deloitte\u2019s 2023 \u201cExploring the industrial metaverse\u201d revealed that 21% of those companies surveyed are incorporating metaverse technologies to improve their supply chain ecosystems.52\nDiving into specific technological applications, a study conducted by Augury revealed that supply chain management and optimization is the top use case for artificial intelligence, as reported by 41% of surveyed respondents.53 Further, the 2024 Material Handling Industry Annual Industry Report showed that respondents identified logistics, shipping and transportation, supplier selection and due diligence, and inventory management as the top three applications of AI.54\nThe modernization of existing facilities, incorporation of advanced technologies (both hardware and software), and support for suppliers to meet current demand are strategic moves that can help strengthen the supply chain for manufacturers and suppliers. (For thoughts on the aerospace and defense industry, see sidebar, \u201cThe aerospace and defense industry may further embrace agile supply chains digital technologies to meet projected demand increase.\u201d)\nThe aerospace and defense industry may further embrace agile supply chains digital technologies to meet projected demand increase\nThe aerospace industry faced significant challenges in meeting post-pandemic demand due to supply chain disruptions. Suppliers may need to be more agile moving forward to capture demand and may consider investing in emerging technologies and smart factory solutions to address supply chain challenges and optimize production capacity.\nInvesting in digital technologies can also provide greater supply chain visibility, foster innovation, and strengthen stakeholder relationships. These investments could improve efficiency and competitiveness, ultimately leading to cost and operational benefits.\nThe next phase of supply chains: Maximizing resilience while maintaining margins\nThe restructuring of the industrial manufacturing supply base reflects the sector\u2019s resilience and adaptability, particularly in the face of external uncertainties. Companies across the sector are continuously seeking opportunities to maximize resilience while keeping margins high. They are finding motivations for restructuring through delivery performance, cost reductions, and government incentives, all aimed at profitable growth.\nAs technology continues to advance, industrial manufacturing and construction companies are maintaining one eye on the future while working to ensure their supply systems of the past. Many new government policies are incentivizing advanced technology or products for future demand. However, these companies should maintain their procurement processes for legacy items. To do this, industrial manufacturing and construction companies are leveraging a multitude of strategies, ranging from diversifying their suppliers and seeking new agreements to bringing capabilities in-house and implementing digital technologies, all in an effort to help create resilient and efficient supply chains.\nChange your Analytics and performance cookie settings\nto access this feature.\nBY\nJim Kilpatrick\nCanadian Consumer Products Industry Leader\nCanada\nJim is the Global Supply Chain & Network Operations Leader for Deloitte Consulting, and the leader for Consumer Products Industry in Canada.

The widely followed index finally hit a record high after two years in January, as momentum from late 2023 continued into the new year.\nEnthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI) continued to boost technology stocks, in particular semiconductor companies. However, unlike last year, the rally broadened out to the more cyclical areas of the market.\nThe strongest sectors included communication services, industrials, materials, energy, and financials. The broadening, driven by strong economic data, resilient corporate earnings, and expectations for rate cuts propelled the S&P 500 to new record highs 22 times during the quarter.\nMoss Adams Wealth Advisors Market View\nHere are our key takeaways on the economy and markets:\nRate Cut Expectations and the Fed\nOptimism was high heading into the new year with inflation having made significant progress toward the Fed\u2019s target in 2023. Heading into Q1, the bond market was pricing in a total of five interest rate cuts this year, with the first expected to be in March.\nHowever, the economy was stronger than expected, which is good news, but inflation turned out to be stickier than expected, which was not good news. This means Fed rate cuts have been pushed out to at least June 2024, with the market now pricing in just three rate cuts at best for 2024.\nStill, in our view, the number of rate cuts isn\u2019t as important as the fact that the Fed is able and willing to cut rates if needed or when they see more progress on inflation.\nAt the Fed\u2019s March open market meeting, the committee left rates unchanged as was expected and upgraded its economic outlook. The statement reiterated the Fed needs greater confidence that inflation is returning to target before easing.\nThe highly watched dot plot continued to show the majority of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members expecting as many as three rate cuts in 2024; however, the number of expected rate cuts in 2025 was reduced from four to three, highlighting that policy easing is likely to be gradual.\nInvestors quickly adjusted to the idea of fewer rate cuts and longer-term interest rates moved higher, causing fixed rate bonds to decline in price. Even with the uptick in interest rates, equities charged higher setting multiple new highs, underscoring the strength in the economy and attractive fundamentals for corporate earnings.\nWith market expectations and Fed messaging now looking aligned for rate cut expectations, it will take a significant change in the economic outlook, particularly inflation trends, to significantly move rates meaningfully one way or the other in the near term.\nFixed Income\nInterest-rate volatility increased in Q1 as strong economic data, stubborn inflation, and reduced rate-cut expectations pushed yields higher, stalling the bond rally seen in late 2023.\nFor the longer term, we expect bonds to resume their rally as inflation and rates decline later this year, albeit at a much slower rate. Within the credit segment, we continue to favor high quality bonds.\nInflation\nHeadline inflation has declined significantly since mid-2022.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index,\u00a0which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, fell from a peak of 7.1% year-over-year growth in June 2022, to just 2.4% as of February 2024, putting it very near the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\nWhile progress in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which has some methodological differences from PCE, has been dramatic, moving from 8.9% at the peak to 3.2% year-over-year as of February, improvements for this indicator have stalled. The CPI has stubbornly hovered around 3.2% since October, sparking concern that it won\u2019t have further meaningful decline.\nWe believe there were seasonal factors elevating the CPI readings in Q1 and the disinflationary forces we saw in 2023 are still intact.\nCore goods prices trended lower in 2023, as supply chain distortions related to the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine continued to fade.\nEven with the recent conflict in the Middle East, supply chains are still in good shape, and goods prices should remain well behaved. Within the more volatile components, energy prices have risen in recent months while food prices continue to ease.\nOverall, the disinflationary trend established in 2023 should continue into 2024. While the ride down may take slightly longer than anticipated, the Fed should feel reasonably confident that inflation can fall to close to their 2% target later this year.\nA Soft Landing Is Our Base Case\nOur base case is that inflation will return to normal in 2024, even as real gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains positive.\nOver the past year, inflation has fallen significantly, even as real GDP growth has accelerated, defying predictions that an economic slump or recession would be needed to resolve entrenched inflation.\nThe most recent measure of real GDP quarter-over-quarter of 3.4% was higher than the long-term average of 3.19%, so quite strong even as inflation trends improved.\nWhile the lagged effects of higher for longer interest rates will likely slow GDP growth in 2024, we believe the trend will continue to be positive\u2014meaning no recession\u2014as inflation recedes toward the 2% target.\nEmployment\nWhile the labor market has normalized from its post-pandemic boom, the US economy still added 250,000 jobs per month in 2023 and sustained this pace into early 2024.\nThe unemployment rate has remained at or below 4% since December 2022\u2014the longest streak of low unemployment since the late 1960s.\nDespite fears of an economic slowdown, strong growth in the US labor supply has allowed employers to steadily hire workers and narrow the gap between supply and demand.\nAfter falling sharply during the pandemic, labor supply in the US staged an impressive recovery over the last two years, largely due to increased immigration.\nLabor market resiliency is key to our soft-landing narrative.\nLooking Forward\nA positive January for US stocks is typically a prelude to a positive year, with that correlation holding true 80% of the time since 1928.\nIn our view, 2024 looks set to be another year of economic expansion supported by:\nTailwinds from federal government initiatives supporting infrastructure spending. We believe the historical signal of a strong start, combined with what\u2019s likely to be peak interest rates, economic expansion, and positive earnings guidance, bodes well for risk assets for the balance of 2024.\nPotential Opportunities\nCash has built up in money market funds over the past two years as the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates to the most attractive levels in over a decade. With central banks around the world indicating their intention to cut rates, there\u2019s an opportunity cost to holding too much cash. Money intended for the long term should be invested in longer-duration assets.\nEconomies around the world continue to grow as inflation wanes and secular tailwinds should continue to support long-term assets such as stocks and bonds.\nThe potential for AI, both for the companies who produce the infrastructure as well as for the companies who will benefit from its potential productivity enhancements is expected to be wide ranging.\nWe believe the market rally can broaden beyond technology as more sectors adopt AI, and as market confidence is buoyed by recent Fed messaging and falling inflation. Some portions of the market are richly valued versus history, so diversification is key.\nIn addition to publicly traded assets, private investment opportunities can provide diversification through different and less correlated sources of return, while lowering overall volatility of a portfolio.\u00a0 We see opportunities in private equity, credit, and real assets.\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict what will happen to markets in the short term, markets have historically done well following a peak in inflation, the conclusion of a Fed tightening cycle, and a trough in consumer confidence.\nWe\u2019re constructive on both stocks and bonds as the economy normalizes and deflationary tailwinds continue.\nWe\u2019re Here to Help\nFor more information about the economic landscape and what it means for investors, contact your Moss Adams professional.\n\n                                Moss Adams Private Client services may include investment advisory services provided by Moss Adams Wealth Advisors LLC, an SEC-registered investment adviser, and/or accounting, tax, and related services provided by Moss Adams LLP.

However, shifting consumer priorities will continue to offer opportunities.\n\nThe State of Fashion 2024\n(128 pages)\nStorm clouds are gathering, but the experience of recent years shows how the fashion industry may ride out the challenges ahead. In 2022, the industry again showed its resilience, almost equaling the record economic profit of 2021, the McKinsey Global Fashion Index shows. Echoing the pattern of the previous year, the luxury sector outperformed, with a 36 percent rise in economic profit that offset weakness in other segments. Yet even the non-luxury sector was ahead of its long-term average. Strong margin performance meant the industry in 2022 achieved more than double the economic profit than in all years between 2011 and 2020, except for one.\nIn 2023, the industry faced challenges that were both persistent and deepening. On a regional basis, Europe and the United States saw slow growth throughout the year, while China\u2019s initially strong performance faded in the second half.

Against this backdrop, businesses will be challenged to identify pockets of value and unlock new drivers of performance.\nAccording to McKinsey\u2019s analysis of fashion forecasts, the global industry will post top-line growth of 2 to 4 percent in 2024 (exhibit), with regional and country-level variations. Once again, the luxury segment is expected to generate the biggest share of economic profit. However, even there, companies will be challenged by the tough economic environment. The segment is forecast to grow globally by 3 to 5 percent, compared with 5 to 7 percent in 2023, as consumers rein in spending after a postpandemic surge. European and Chinese growth is set to slow, while US growth is expected to pick up after a relatively weak 2023, reflecting the slightly more optimistic outlook there.\n\nBeyond luxury, growth of 2 to 4 percent is predicted for the year ahead, in line with the probable outcome in 2023. The European market will likely expand by just 1 to 3 percent, compared with 5 percent in the first half of 2023 and 1 to 3 percent in the second half. Slumping consumer confidence and declining household savings are expected to be the most probable causes of restrained spending. In the United States, nonluxury sector growth of 0 to 2 percent is forecast. And China is expected to be similarly challenged amid 4 to 6 percent growth, which is a slight uptick from the end of 2023 but slow when considered on a historical basis.\nThese are just some of the findings from The State of Fashion 2024, published by the Business of Fashion (BoF) and McKinsey.

A key theme will be companies keeping a firm grip on costs and inventories while driving growth by precisely managing prices. Brands and suppliers can expect an increasingly competitive environment. But they will also have opportunities, with consumers discovering new styles, tastes, and priorities\u2014all presenting routes to value creation. As previously done, this year\u2019s report highlights ten emerging themes that will be high on leadership agendas.\n\n\nGlobal economy:\n\nFragmented future. In 2024, the global economic outlook will continue to be unsettled, as financial, geopolitical, and other challenges weigh on consumer confidence. Fashion markets in China, Europe, and the United States will likely face headwinds, some of which reflect individual regional dynamics. Suppliers, brands, and retailers may need to bolster contingency planning and manage for uncertainty.\nClimate urgency. The frequency and intensity of extreme weather-related events in 2023 mean the climate crisis is an even more urgent priority than in previous years. With physical and transition risks rising across continents, the industry must not delay in tackling emissions and building resilience into supply chains.\n\nConsumer shifts:\n\n\nVacation mode. Consumers are gearing up for the biggest year of travel since before the pandemic. But a shift in values means expectations are evolving, even as shopping remains a priority. Brands and retailers should refresh distribution and category strategies to reflect the new reality.\n\nThe new face of influence. It\u2019s time for brand marketers to update their influencer playbooks, as a new guard of creative personalities wins fans. Working with opinion leaders in 2024 will require a different type of partnership, an emphasis on video, and a willingness to loosen the reins on creative control.\nOutdoors reinvented. Technical outdoor clothing and \u201cgorpcore\u201d are in demand as consumers embrace healthier lifestyles. In 2024, more outdoor brands are expected to launch lifestyle collections. At the same time, lifestyle brands will likely embed technical elements into collections, blurring the lines between functionality and style.\n\nFashion system:\n\n\nGenerative AI\u2019s creative crossroads. After generative AI\u2019s (gen AI) breakout year in 2023, more use cases are emerging across the industry.

Fast-fashion competition is set to be fiercer than ever. Challengers, led by Shein and Temu, are bringing new tactics on price, customer experience, and speed. Success for disruptors and incumbents could hinge on adapting to new consumer preferences while navigating the regulatory agenda.\nAll eyes on brand. Brand marketing is expected to be back in the spotlight as the fashion industry manages a switch away from performance marketing. Brands may benefit from forging emotional connections with consumers as marketers rewrite playbooks to emphasise long-term brand building.\nSustainability rules. The era of fashion industry self-regulation is drawing to a close. Across jurisdictions, new rules will have significant effects on both consumers and fashion players. Brands and manufacturers may consider revamping business models to align with the changes ahead.\nBullwhip snaps back. Shifts in consumer demand have created a \u201cbullwhip effect,\u201d by which order volatility reverberates unpredictably through supply chains. Suppliers will likely face pressure as brands and retailers focus on transparency and strategic partnerships.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nAs the industry continues to be challenged by geopolitical and economic headwinds, fashion leaders in 2024 will look to strike a careful balance between managing uncertainty and seizing opportunities. With cost-saving tactics mostly exhausted, companies may focus on growing sales, underpinned by new pricing and promotion strategies. Across the industry, net intent to raise prices is more than 50 percent, according to the BoF\u2013McKinsey Executive Survey. At the same time, reduced cost pressures could provide a potential boost to performance.\nAs climate change brings increasingly extreme weather events and global temperatures rise, the coming year is likely to mark a heightened industry focus on environmental, social, and governance issues. Our survey shows that the topic is seen as both the number-one priority and number-one challenge for industry executives. The most successful companies will find a balance between sustainability initiatives, risk management, and commercial imperatives.\nIn an uncertain world, consumer discretionary spend will be weighted toward trusted categories and brands. Hard luxury goods\u2014jewelry, watches, and leather\u2014will likely be in demand, reflecting their potential investment value in tough economic times. Consumers are expected to travel more and continue spending more time outdoors. And they prefer emotional connections and authenticity over celebrity endorsements.\nAll told, executives are bracing for a strategically complex year ahead. To counter uncertainty, leading companies will prepare for a range of outcomes. The most successful will become more resilient, better equipped to manage the challenges, and ready to accelerate when the storm clouds begin to clear.\nAnita Balchandani is a senior partner in McKinsey\u2019s London office, where Ewa Starzynska is a consultant; David Barrelet is an associate partner in the Munich office; Achim Berg is a senior partner in the Frankfurt office; Gemma D\u2019Auria is a senior partner in the Milan office; and Felix R\u00f6lkens is a partner in the Berlin office.

      "\n                        Essential Guide for Demand Forecasting in 2024                    \nDemand forecasting is a critical component of supply chain management, especially in the complex and unpredictable market landscape of 2024. \nAccurate forecasts are essential for maintaining inventory balance, ensuring customer satisfaction, and achieving financial stability. Inaccuracies in forecasting can lead to overstocking, which immobilizes capital, or stockouts, which again result in lost sales and damaged customer relationships.\nTo address these challenges, supply chain professionals must adopt advanced forecasting methods. \nOur 2024 guide provides supply chain managers and planners with the latest tools and insights to refine their demand forecasting processes. Let\u2019s get started with definitions, differences between demand planning and demand forecasting and benefits.\nWhat is Demand Forecasting? \nDemand forecasting is the process of predicting future customer demand for a product or service. This practice has evolved significantly from its historical roots, largely a game of educated guesses, to today\u2019s data-driven approach that harnesses the power of advanced analytics.\nDemand forecasting is a cornerstone in the modern supply chain, enabling businesses to align their operations with market dynamics and customer needs.\nHistorically, demand forecasting relied on simple tools and intuition, but as supply chains have become more complex and globalized, the need for sophisticated forecasting methods has grown.\nThe evolution of demand forecasting mirrors technological advancements and the proliferation of data analytics, transforming it into a precise and strategic function that influences a wide array of business decisions, from production planning to financial management.\nWhat are the Benefits of Demand Forecasting? \nThe benefits of demand forecasting are enhanced operational efficiency, improved supply chain resilience, reduced excess inventory, and easier identification of new market opportunities all of them lead to increased profits. \nThe main benefits of accurate demand forecasts are:\n1. Improved Supply Chain Resilience \nAnticipating demand fluctuations allows companies to adjust their inventory levels proactively, thereby reducing the risk of stockouts or overstocking.This foresight enables businesses to balance supply and demand, ensuring they can meet customer needs without holding excess inventory that ties up capital and space.\u00a0When companies have the right products available at the right time, they avoid the costly disruptions that come with unexpected demand changes, making their supply chains more resilient and adaptable to market dynamics.\n2. Easy Identification of New Market Opportunities \nDemand forecasting plays a crucial role in spotting emerging trends and market opportunities before they become apparent to competitors.Analyzing data and identifying patterns allows companies to predict shifts in consumer preferences and market demands, allowing them to innovate and introduce new products or services ahead of the curve.This proactive approach can open new revenue streams and strengthen market positioning, giving companies a competitive edge.\n3. Revenue Increase \nOne of the most direct benefits of accurate demand forecasting is the potential for increased revenue.When production and inventory are aligned with anticipated demand, companies ensure they are well-positioned to meet customer needs, maximizing sales opportunities and minimizing lost sales due to stockouts.Furthermore, accurate forecasting helps optimize pricing strategies and promotional activities, driving additional revenue growth.\n4. Reduced Excess Inventory \nAccurate demand forecasts mean that companies only produce and store what they need, significantly reducing the costs associated with excess inventory.This includes the direct costs of storage, insurance, and capital associated with unsold goods and the indirect costs related to obsolescence, depreciation, and waste.Minimized excess inventory enables companies to operate more leanly and efficiently, freeing up resources for investment in other business areas.\n5. Enhanced Customer Satisfaction \nCompanies can significantly enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring product availability through accurate demand forecasting. Customers expect timely product delivery, and consistently meeting this expectation is crucial for maintaining customer loyalty and trust.Accurate forecasting helps achieve a high service level, reducing the likelihood of stockouts and the frustration they cause customers.\n6. Supporting Sustainable Practices \nAccurate demand forecasting contributes to more sustainable business practices by minimizing waste.

      " News\n Life\n Entertainment\n  Finance\n Sports\nNew on Yahoo\nYahoo Finance\nU.S. gas prices in 2024: how much is gasoline in each state?\nIn This Article: \nAt the time of writing, the national average price of regular gas is $3.62 per gallon, $0.02 higher than this time last year. Drivers who use premium gas are paying $0.07 more this year than last year at $4.42 per gallon. While Americans are currently paying about 15 percent less for gas than in 2022, prices are expected to climb higher throughout 2024. Numerous factors impact the price drivers pay at the pump, including the cost of crude oil, taxes, distribution and refining. Gas prices also depend on the ZIP code you fill up in, with states in the West paying the highest gas prices on average and Southeastern states paying the lowest.\nKey gas price statistics\nHere\u2019s what to know about regular gasoline prices:\nInsurance Auto\nThe current national gas price average is $3.62 per gallon.\nThe average cost of gas has decreased 15% in the last two years, from when it was $4.27 per gallon.\nThe highest recorded average price of regular gas was in June 2022 at $5.06 per gallon.\nDrivers in California currently pay the most for gas at an average of $5.39 per gallon. Hawaii follows close behind at an average of $4.72 per gallon.\nThe average price of gas increased by 27 cents in the first two weeks of April 2024, and AAA anticipates the cost will continue to rise.\nWhy gas price matters\nGas prices impact all drivers\u2019 personal finances. As the cost of gas increases, it could mean having less money to spend on other necessities, such as food and housing. It may even create difficulties getting to work if you have a long commute. Drivers also tend to put off car maintenance to save money on overall vehicle expenses, but this can lead to higher repair costs down the line.\nWhen gas prices are low, drivers have more wiggle room in their budgets for daily essentials and car care and are more likely to take road trips. Tracking regular gasoline prices and planning for seasonal price fluctuations is as important to vehicle ownership as carrying the proper levels of auto insurance and keeping up with maintenance.\nGas prices by year\nGas prices within the last 10 years highlight how volatile the market can be. When looking at historical data, gas prices were the same in 2011 as they were in 2023 \u2014 $3.52 per gallon. However, prices can swing drastically, sometimes jumping several cents in a short span of time. For example, from May 2022 to June 2022 the average cost of gas increased by $0.88 per gallon. Data below from the U.S. Energy Administration show fuel costs from 2011 to 2023.\nYear\nAverage price per gallon (regular grade)\n2011\n$3.52\n2012\n$3.62\n2013\n$3.51\n2014\n$3.36\n2015\n$2.43\n2016\n$2.14\n2017\n$2.42\n2018\n$2.72\n2019\n$2.60\n2020\n$2.17\n2021\n$3.01\n2022\n$3.95\n2023\n$3.52\nHistorical gas prices and trends\nFluctuations in gas prices are a normal trend around the globe. There are numerous events that may cause increases or decreases in prices, including supply and demand. As demand for gas increases, the price of gas typically increases with it, and vice versa.\nIn 2020, for instance, Americans were using far less fuel. There was less demand for gas due to many countries imposing lockdowns and limiting travel due to COVID-19. As a result, gas supply saw an unexpected increase with less demand, which brought the average price of gas down.\nGlobal conflict is currently playing a significant role in gas prices in the U.S. Russia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of oil to global markets. After the Russian attack on Ukraine, the U.S. and the E.U. placed sanctions on Russian oil and natural gas. These sanctions and other world conflicts are still impacting current gas costs.\nHistorical gas prices also show how changes in cost can occur anytime there is a disruption in the supply chain, such as a fire or damage to a refinery. For example, in 2008, when gas prices were at their highest, the cause was due to a combination of unprecedented demand from China, the Middle East and Latin America, as well as uncertainty in the supply chain, which all negatively impacted the cost drivers paid.\nGas prices by state\nThe gas prices chart below, based on daily price updates from AAA, illustrates how much the cost of gas can vary from one state to another. California, Hawaii and Washington hold the top spots for having the most expensive current gas prices. The least expensive regular gas prices are found in Colorado, Mississippi and Louisiana.\nDuring the first week of April 2024, California saw the biggest increase in the cost of gas compared to any other state. Gas prices rose $0.23 in California and $0.19 in Arizona. These changes are significant when compared to Montana, Ohio and Minnesota, all of which saw increases of less than a penny.\nState\nRegular\nAlabama\n$3.23\nAlaska\n$4.28\nArizona\n$4.10\nArkansas\n$3.19\nCalifornia\n$5.39\nColorado\n$3.08\nConnecticut\n$3.46\nDelaware\n$3.37\nDistrict of Columbia\n$3.73\nFlorida\n$3.51\nGeorgia\n$3.40\nHawaii\n$4.72\nIdaho\n$3.85\nIllinois\n$4.00\nIndiana\n$3.66\nIowa\n$3.33\nKansas\n$3.26\nKentucky\n$3.37\nLouisiana\n$3.18\nMaine\n$3.39\nMaryland\n$3.64\nMassachusetts\n$3.33\nMichigan\n$3.54\nMinnesota\n$3.32\nMississippi\n$3.10\nMissouri\n$3.33\nMontana\n$3.59\nNebraska\n$3.39\nNevada\n$4.59\nNew Hampshire\n$3.30\nNew Jersey\n$3.33\nNew Mexico\n$3.32\nNew York\n$3.47\nNorth Carolina\n$3.30\nNorth Dakota\n$3.42\nOhio\n$3.48\nOklahoma\n$3.21\nOregon\n$4.42\nPennsylvania\n$3.70\nRhode Island\n$3.34\nSouth Carolina\n$3.24\nSouth Dakota\n$3.37\nTennessee\n$3.29\nTexas\n$3.23\nUtah\n$3.90\nVermont\n$3.39\nVirginia\n$3.47\nWashington\n$4.65\nWest Virginia\n$4.69\nWisconsin\n$3.38\nWyoming\n$3.35\nGas prices by season\nSeasonality is another factor influencing how much drivers pay at the pump. In the last 10 years, the least expensive months for gas prices have been November, December and January. The most expensive months have been May, June and July. Since gas prices are tied to supply and demand, costs during the summer months are seemingly higher since more Americans are vacationing and traveling by car. Higher prices could also result from weather-related events, such as hurricanes, which can disrupt production and put added pressure on demand.\nMonth\nAverage gas prices from 2013 to 2023\nJanuary\n$2.77\nFebruary\n$2.83\nMarch\n$2.98\nApril\n$3.02\nMay\n$3.12\nJune\n$3.19\nJuly\n$3.15\nAugust\n$3.08\nSeptember\n$3.05\nOctober\n$3.00\nNovember\n$2.90\nDecember\n$2.77\nHow to save money on gas\nWhen it comes to gas prices, the volatility and fluctuations in the market are out of drivers\u2019 hands. However, there are steps you can take that will help you cut back on how much gas you use and how much vehicle expenses eat into your budget.\nChoose a vehicle with greater fuel efficiency. Look for models that get the best fuel economy in their class and avoid buying too large of an engine, if possible.\nAvoid driving at high speeds when possible. For every 5 mph above 50 mph, drivers essentially pay an additional $0.22 per gallon of gasoline, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Aggressive driving, such as speeding, braking too hard and accelerating too fast, also impacts the amount of fuel used.\nCombine trips for errands. Try to combine as many short trips together as you can. This saves fuel by limiting driving and preventing you from having to warm up your vehicle as often.\nRemove heavy items from your vehicle. The more weight you load into your vehicle, the greater the use of gas. If you do have larger items, it\u2019s recommended to store them in your trunk versus a roof rack. Roof racks cause drag, which uses a greater amount of gas.\nMaintain your vehicle. Keeping your car in top condition is another way to improve fuel efficiency. Keeping your engine tuned, emissions in check and tires inflated at the right pressure all improve fuel usage.\nThe average cost of car insurance\nThe cheapest car insurance companies\nOnline car insurance quotes\nCompare car insurance rates\nFrequently asked questions\nWhy are gas prices going up in 2024?It is normal for gas prices to fluctuate throughout the year. They tend to be lower in the winter and increase through spring and summer. Predictions on the overall cost of gas for 2024 change regularly, in part because of the implications of conflicts overseas. But odds are gas costs will continue to increase, particularly during the summer months when Americans travel more.\nWhat state has the lowest gas prices?At the time of publication, drivers in Colorado pay the lease for gas at $3.07 per gallon, but fuel costs are on the rise. Drivers in Mississippi and Louisiana pay an average of $3.10 and $3.18, respectively, and have seen recent decreases that are fractions of a cent.\nWhat is the highest gas prices have gone?Nationally, the highest average cost of gas was in June 2022 at $5.06 per gallon. While states like California may see gas above $5.00 a gallon on a fairly regular basis, that is not true for most other states.\nRecommended Stories\nSign in to access your portfolio\n",
      "US Gas Price Map Shows States Where Costs Falling Fastest\nGas prices are falling across the U.S.\u2014but some states are faring better than others.\nAccording to the American Automobile Association (AAA), as of Thursday, the national average for gas prices is $3.242 per gallon. This represents a decrease from last month's average of $3.443 per gallon for regular gas and an even larger drop from September of last year, when prices were at $3.836 per gallon. Data from GasBuddy also shows that a decline in prices has been consistent for the past six weeks.\nThis downward trend in gas prices will provide some relief to motorists, who have been facing higher than usual fuel costs in recent years, with averages in some states exceeding $5 per gallon in 2022.\nMore From Newsweek Vault: Earn up to 5% Cash Back With a Gas Credit Card\nThe nationwide average for a gallon of regular fuel is expected to fall under $3 as early as October, for the first time in three years. The last time gas prices were recorded below a $3 average was in April 2021.\nWhere Are Gas Costs Falling Fastest?\nFrom September 2023 to Sept. 13, 2024, gas prices have fallen most significantly in Western states, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).\nThere are two states in which gas prices have fallen by more than a dollar. In Arizona, where the biggest drop has been recorded, gas prices have fallen by $1.073. Last September, a gallon would have set you back $4.490 - but now it costs $3.417.\nMore From Newsweek Vault: Online Banks vs. Traditional Banks: Learn the Differences\nIn Oregon, a gallon of regular fuel is almost a dollar cheaper now than it was at this time in 2023, down to $3.755 from $4.715 - a difference of 97 cents. Neighboring Washington has had similar luck, with prices falling by 91 cents from $5.061 to $4.151.\nBucking the trend of fast dropping prices being concentrated in the Western states, Oklahomans are also paying nearly a dollar less for fuel now. A drop of 95 cents has been recorded there - the third-largest decline in the country. Minnesota has also seen a dramatic decline, of 93 cents.\nMore From Newsweek Vault: Learn About the Best High-Yield Checking Accounts\nOutside of the contiguous U.S., in Alaska gas costs have dropped from $4.597 to $3.722 - 87 cents from September to September.\n\"There are an ever-increasing number of states east of the Rockies that have some retail gas locations selling regular for under $3 a gallon, so drivers will have more in their wallets with autumn approaching,\" said Andrew Gross, an AAA spokesperson. \"Should the national average fall below $3, it will be the first time since May 2021.\"\nWhile the trend for declining prices has been observed in every U.S. state, some haven't seen such significant drops. The lowest recorded fall is in Hawaii, where gas is only 16 cents cheaper now than it was in September 2023.\nComparatively slow declines have also been reported in Michigan, dropping from $3.634 to $3.276 - just 36 cents less expensive than a year ago. Other Eastern states haven't seen gas prices drop by nearly as much as in the West, with drops ranging between 40 cents to 66 cents across the region.\nfairness meter\nfairness meter\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter. \nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter. \n\nTop stories\n\nTrump Is Picking the 'Avenger Squad' for Cabinet, Charlie Kirk Says\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nTrump Allies React to Biden Allowing Ukraine to Hit Russia With US ATACMS\n\nTrump Picks FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr To Lead the Agency\nAbout the writer\nAliss Higham is a Newsweek reporter based in Glasgow, Scotland.

      "2024 Preview: Four New Trucking Regulations to Watch\nThere are some major changes on the horizon for commercial trucking. Is your fleet prepared? As 2023 draws to a close, it\u2019s critical that organizations set aside time research the many regulatory updates that could take place throughout 2024.\nBelow, we explore some of the most significant regulations and the proactive steps you can take to ready your commercial drivers.\u00a0\n1. FMCSA Safety Measurement System (SMS) Updates\u00a0\nPerhaps the largest potential shift in commercial transportation is the\u00a0updated\u00a0FMCSA Safety Measurement System (SMS). The FMCSA has proposed nine major changes to their methodology, including (but not limited to): \u00a0\nThese wide-reaching changes will have major impacts on all carriers. We explore some of the finer details in a recent webinar, \u201cExpert Perspectives: Navigating FMCSA\u2019s Proposed Methodology Changes.\u201d\u00a0\n2. CDL Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse: Return to Duty Process \u00a0\nPer Title 49 CFR parts 40 and 382, drivers with drug or alcohol violations are given \u201cprohibited\u201d status in the FMCSA\u2019s Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. As of November 18, 2024, all prohibited drivers will lose either existing commercial driving privileges or their approval for a Commercial Learners Permit (CLP). \u00a0\nDrivers will be required to undergo a rigorous re-evaluation to return to good standing. Prohibited drivers must: \u00a0\nTo prevent potential suspension, drivers and fleet managers alike must learn the ins and outs of Clearinghouse procedures, including pre-employment drug and alcohol testing, how to access records and what data must be reported to the FMCSA.\u00a0\n3. Mandatory Speed Limiters\nA redacted DOT report ruffled feathers this fall, suggesting that commercial vehicle speeds would soon be limited to 68 mph on interstates and highways. The organization quickly backtracked and explained that the specific speed limit was yet to be determined. Evaluation is still underway, however, and the official proposal will be published on Friday, December 29, 2023. In addition to the maximum speed limit, the documentation will also outline which types of vehicles are subject to the new regulations. It\u2019s widely believed that speed limiters will only be required for vehicles made after 2003 that weigh 26,000 pounds or more.\nIt will likely take a while before speed limiters affect day-to-day operations, but it\u2019s always a good idea to remind drivers about safe driving practices like speed management. These seven safety messages can help create positive habits.\n4. Competency and Skills Testing\nIn 2009, the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety submitted a proposal urging the FMCSA to implement a competency test for commercial drivers, ensuring that all commercial drivers on American roadways are qualified, properly trained and well-versed in federal regulations. The petition sat in limbo for the next 14 years. In\u00a0August of 2023, to the surprise of many, the FMCSA issued an Advance Notice of Potential Rule Making (ANPRM) indicating their intent to pursue the motion. \u00a0\nAlthough this new regulation has not yet gone into effect, it\u2019s in commercial carriers\u2019 best interest to revisit their approach to training and hiring in 2024. Routine training is valuable for new drivers and seasoned professionals alike. In fact, SambaSafety data shows that fleets who undergo monthly training have 50% fewer violations that those who train twice a year. An effective driver training program should incorporate a healthy blend of topics \u2014 like space management, distracted driving and defensive driving \u2014 that are relevant to people of all skill levels. \u00a0\nCommercial carriers should also maintain strict hiring practices to mitigate problems before they happen. Vetting drivers carefully will quickly identify high-risk candidates, ensuring only the safest and most skilled drivers are behind the wheel. \u00a0\nNavigating New Trucking Regulations\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of advanced preparation. Dedicating time to explore all new trucking regulations the only way fleet managers can set their organizations up for ongoing success in the coming year. Luckily, we\u2019ve done some of the heavy lifting for you.

      " Article\n Mid-Year Update: Logistics & Freight Key Themes For 2024\n Logistics & Freight Transport / Global / Tue 09 Jul, 2024\nAt the midpoint of 2024, we reassess the performance of our Logistics & Freight Key Themes for 2024, as outlined in December 2023.\nMost of our projections are materialising as expected, with intensified risks impacting Red Sea-bound shipping and climatic challenges tightening global container capacity, resulting in a significant surge in freight rates over H1 2024. Despite this, rates have not surpassed pre-pandemic highs, largely due to a record influx of new container ships being launched in 2024, extending into 2025. \u00a0Escalating geopolitical tensions and security threats in the Middle East, notably the Houthi militants' threats to maritime vessels in the Red Sea, are further straining maritime trade routes and raising risk of delays and insurance costs for shippers. The extensive fleet expansion anticipated for 2024 is being quickly absorbed as additional vessels are needed to maintain delivery schedules, now complicated by Red Sea diversions.\u00a0The most acute recent shipping price surges are concentrated on trade from Mainland China to West-bound routes, partly driven by a rebound in global demand as trade recovers following a sluggish 2023. \u00a0Supply chain dynamics throughout 2024 are shifting in response to trade and investment policy changes, climate risks and national security concerns. As global supply chains continue to de-risk, transformations such as nearshoring and reshoring will become more prevalent. Logistics operators are also increasingly investing in clean energy in line with strict decarbonisation mandates, supporting the sector's drive towards sustainability. Finally we still expect reduced labour disturbances in transportation compared to 2023, thanks to easing cost of living pressures and the advancement of automation technologies.\nEast-West Shipping Costs Climb as Trade Rebounds and Red Sea Threats Loom\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPanama Canal's Rain-Dependent Revival Will Ease Global Shipping Risks;\u00a0\nDecoding Global Risks: Insights from Our Red Sea Crisis Webinar\nMorocco's Greenfield Port To Relieve Western Mediterranean Congestion\nMexico Rides Investment Wave To Reach Record-High FDI Inflows In 2023\nGreen Corridors Expand, As Asia Remains At The Forefront Of Hydrogen Shipbuilding\nGreen Hydrogen Trade: Highlighting The Global Leaders\nYemeni Houthis Will Continue To Threaten Maritime Trade So Long As Fighting Continues In Gaza\nIsrael Hamas War Update: Notable Risks From Israeli Tensions With Hezbollah And Rising Social Discontent\nTrump Second Term Scenario: Myriad Obstacles To Rapprochement With Russia\nBreakdown Of US East Coast Dockworker Negotiations Risks Freight Disruptions, Higher Costs\nCanada Cargo Volumes At Risk From Potential Rail, Port, And Customs Strikes\nKey View:\u00a0The record number of containerships coming online in 2024 have been quickly absorbed so far, largely due to Red Sea diversions as more ships are facing longer distances and concomitant delays. Freight rates spiked sharply in H1 2024 and will remain structurally high over the remainder of 2024 as the global trade outlook remains supportive and shippers continue to frontload they cargo requirements ahead of the usual peak season of East-West trade. We believe that container freight rates will remain below pandemic era highs as more capacity comes online and carriers readjust schedules. Rates will likely come down from Q3 2024 highs over Q4 2024 as we anticipate subdued demand later in the year.\nMid-Year Update: While there will still be a record number of new containerships being brought into service in 2024, the capacity brought online by containerships in H12024 has already been snapped up by the Red Sea diversions. The longer route around the Cape of Good Hope has necessitated an uptick in the number of ships required to meet recovering global trade demand. There would have been significant overcapacity if the Red Sea crisis were to be solved in the near term; however, we do not expect an easing of the attacks for the remainder of the year. As a result, diversions around the Cape of Good Hope are likely to remain the norm across H2 2024 given that carriers have adjusted their routes to best accommodate circumventing the Suez Canal route.\nPerfect Storm Of Diversions And High Demand Fueling Freight Rate Increases\nSelected Routes - Freight Rates, USD per 40ft container\nWe initially expected relatively low freight rates for 2024 when we wrote our key themes in November 2023, reflecting our belief of a wide disconnect between supply and demand for containerised goods. However, we note four key reasons behind elevated freight rates for the remainder of the year:\u00a0\nKey View:\u00a0For the remainder of 2024, we anticipate an increase in the number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals in the transport sector, driven by the acquisition of smaller players. However, average deal values are expected to be smaller. Larger companies will continue acquiring to enhance their reach and efficiency, and adapt to near-shoring and broader supply chain shifts, while smaller players face tough financial conditions.\nMid-Year Update: In H1 2024, the global transport sector recorded 137 M&A deals with an average value of USD62.2mn per deal, marking an 81.9% drop from the average half-yearly deal values of USD344.2mn seen in 2021 and 2022, according to Bloomberg. This trend of increasing M&A deals but shrinking deal values is evident across maritime, road, rail \u00a0and air transport. Larger companies acquiring smaller, financially struggling players drive this pattern, which is expected to persist throughout 2024. In H1 2024, the maritime sector dominated M&A activity, accounting for 63.9% of deal value. According to Bloomberg, larger players like Maersk and Cosco reported strong financial rebounds, with Maersk's net profits up 145.6% to USD208mn and Cosco's profits increasing by 277.6% to USD1.1bn in Q1 2024 from Q4 2023 levels.\u00a0\nGeopolitical events in the Red Sea pushed freight rates up due to closed traditional shipping lanes and increased risks. This situation benefited larger freighters who managed extra mileage and fuel costs effectively, unlike smaller operators who faced rising operational costs and could not easily capitalise on higher freight rates. Consequently, companies like ADNOC Logistics & Services, which acquired Navig8 Topco Holdings Inc, and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co SA, which acquired Gram Car Carriers ASA, have been acquiring smaller operators to enhance efficiency and scale throughout H1 2024.\nM&A Activity Defined By More Deals, Lower Values And Smaller Targets\nGlobal Transport Sector - M&A Deal Count & Avg Value Per Deal (USDbn)\nThe road transport sector experienced 36 deals valued at USD2.5bn in H1 2024, primarily in Asia, according to Bloomberg. The focus is on expanding service offerings and geographic reach, particularly in cold chain logistics and specialised transport services. Nearshoring, friend-shoring, and reshoring trends are driving these acquisitions to improve supply chain resilience and efficiency. Asia and Europe are leading regions for M&A activity in the transport sector, accounting for 34.9% and 31.1% of all deals, respectively, in H1 2024, totalling 444 deals globally. Europe remains at the top in terms of deal value, making up 54.2% of the total. Europe\u2019s interconnected markets and regulatory frameworks attract cross-border acquisitions, fostering economic cohesion. Asia, particularly Mainland China and Southeast Asia, is pivotal due to its manufacturing capabilities and evolving logistics networks. Strategic initiatives like nearshoring and friend-shoring in these regions aim to enhance supply chain agility and reduce dependency on distant markets.\nLooking ahead, we expect the volume of M&A deals in the transport sector to continue growing in 2024, though the average deal value will likely remain below historical levels. The drive for nearshoring and strengthening supply chains, especially in Europe, the US and Asia will sustain M&A activity, with larger companies acquiring smaller players to enhance their reach and efficiency. In H1 2021, global transport sector M&A deals totalled USD69.5bn but have since fallen to USD8.5bn in H1 2024. We foresee modest growth in deal values for the remainder of 2024.\nM&A Target Regions Amidst Reshoring And Supply Chain Strengthening\nGlobal Transport Sector - M&A Activity By Target Region (H1 2024)\nKey View: The pace of global supply chain de-risking will accelerate, primarily catalysed by emerging trade and investment policy regulations, climate-related risks, and security considerations. Concurrently, supply chain transformations such as nearshoring and reshoring will take place.\nMid-Year Update: The post-pandemic supply chain shift from \u2018just-in-time\u2019 to \u2018just-in-case' strategic investment flows into operations will continue over the coming quarters largely driven by new trade and investment policy rules and national security considerations (particularly surrounding energy and advanced technology sectors). Despite a reduction in supply chain stress since the pandemic's peak, global networks remain more disjointed compared to pre-pandemic levels. In response, companies will aim to reduce reliance on distant suppliers and protect against trade restrictions and geopolitical risks, while expanding their operations into low-cost manufacturing hubs. Nearshoring, reshoring and friend-shoring of supply chains will gain pace with markets in Europe, North America and Asia (excluding Mainland China) being the key beneficiaries of these trends.\nOver 2024, we expect growth in port throughput in East and South East Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, well-integrated parts of Western Europe, the Gulf States as well as Canada and Mexico. Consequently, region-centric carriers with exposure to these markets across the logistics space are well-placed to leverage regionalisation-supportive policies to support revenues, as the global economy improves in 2024.\nClimate change impacts will also play a role in altering freight flows and route selection, as demonstrated by extreme weather events such as El Nino. Drought and flood risks can negatively affect some of the world's busiest ports as well as inland waterways such as the Rhine, Danube, Mississippi and the Yangtze rivers, by slowing freight flows and limiting load capacity on barges or feeders.\u00a0The 2023 El Ni\u00f1o-triggered drought severely disrupted Panama Canal transits, a critical artery for global trade. As water levels dropped, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) imposed draft and transit restrictions. This compelled bulk carriers and tankers to navigate around the Cape of Good Hope, to avoid congestion and delays. Nevertheless, the Panama Canal has shown a resurgence in trade activity in H1 2024, due to increased rainfall improving water levels. The ACP has been increasing daily transit slots, supporting a rebound in trade flow and boosting confidence in the canal's prospects for H2 2024. Yet, while Lake Gatun's water levels are on the rise, achieving historical averages is still reliant on ample rainfall. Therefore, drought risks pose a threat to consistent freight flows through Panama.\nKey View: The adoption of sustainable fuels is ongoing within the transport sector, in line with more stringent emissions regulations. Logistics companies are investing in advanced carbon reduction technologies to reduce their emissions while techniques to modify operations such as slow steaming are being undermined by Red Sea challenges.\nMid-Year Update: Carriers are ramping up investments in carbon reduction and clean-energy innovations to align with the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) stringent decarbonisation rules and net-zero GHG emissions targets. Key targets for reducing emissions are set for 2030 and 2040, aiming for net zero by 2050, using 2008 as the baseline. The IMO's two-pronged strategy to reduce maritime emissions incorporate a technical standard for lowering the greenhouse gas intensity of marine fuels and an economic policy involving carbon pricing tied to fuel emissions levels. Recent key measures include the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI), Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP).\u00a0\nOn a regional level, the the EU is advancing its environmental regulations with initiatives like the Fit for 55 package, which includes the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and FuelEU Maritime. These programmes require companies to financially account for their emissions. Specifically, the ETS will enforce a gradual rise in the emissions shippers must cover, starting at 40% in 2024, increasing to 70% in 2025 and reaching 100% coverage by 2026. Major carriers such as CMA CGM, Maersk, and Hapag-Lloyd have outlined plans to introduce surcharges to progressively pass on compliance costs, in an effort to\u00a0manage the new carbon pricing mechanisms. Meanwhile, shipping companies that considered slow steaming to cut emissions and manage vessel supply are facing challenges from the Red Sea crisis. Longer detours and accelerated speeds to offset delays, especially on Asia-Europe bound routes, are undermining this emission-reduction strategy.\nLogistics operators are investing in cleaner energy solutions in the coming years, particularly those operating larger vessels between EU ports. Many large ports in the region are making investments in the near term as EU\u2019s recently adopted Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) sets a pivotal requirement for maritime ports within the bloc, mandating them to offer shore-side electricity for vessels by the year 2030. Key logistics hubs in Asia and Europe, namely Singapore and the Netherlands, are creating partnerships to establish green shipping lanes. Meanwhile, the US is enhancing its sustainable port operations by providing funds for zero-emission equipment and infrastructure.\nCarriers are increasingly adopting alternative fuels as a decarbonisation technique, with liquefied natural gas (LNG) leading the way due to its environmental and economic benefits. Despite the emergence of dual-fuel methanol and ammonia engines, LNG's price competitiveness, abundant supply \u00a0and established infrastructure render it a more feasible option. The global fleet already includes over 2,400 LNG-fueled vessels with\u00a0LNG being most dominant among container ships compared to other ship types.\u00a0According to data from DNV on July 3 2024, there were 597 LNG-fueled ships added to the global fleet up from 357 in 2023 (marking a 101% increase), 141 LPG ships, 53 methanol ships and 19 hydrogen ships. LNG bunkering is expanding, which further supports the adaption of LNG fuelled fleets. However, environmental challenges remain, notably methane slip during bunkering (gaseous methane emissions) which requires stringent standards and efficient technology to mitigate. Overall, the shipping sectors adoption of LNG as an alternative fuel reflects its strategic effort to balance immediate environmental benefits with long-term sustainability and regulatory compliance.\nCleaner Alternative Fuels Gaining Traction\nGlobal Shipping Fleet - Alternative Fuel Uptake By Number Of Ships\nKey View:\u00a0Heightened security threats to cargo ships in proximity to conflict zones will drive up insurance premiums, in addition to the supplementary costs and delays incurred from implementing preventive measures. The likelihood of disruptions and losses induced by conflict will be most prominent within the Red and Black Sea maritime regions.\nMid-Year Update: We anticipate that shipping and transport companies will face higher insurance premiums and operational costs due to increased geopolitical and conflict-related risks, particularly in the Red Sea. The conflict between Israel and Hamas, which escalated in October 2023, has created a tense regional environment as of mid-2024. Actions by Houthi forces in Yemen, including firing ballistic missiles toward Israel and attacking cargo ships in the Red Sea, have significantly decreased traffic along key maritime routes. As a result, shipping companies face heightened risks through the Suez Canal and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. According to IMF port watch data, the number of cargo and tanker ships transiting these routes has decreased by 53.7% and 63.7%, respectively, from November 2023 to May 2024. These increased risks have driven up insurance costs and many companies have rerouted to bypass the affected lanes resulting in less efficient, costlier routes, delayed transit times and rising fuel costs.\u00a0\nShipping Re-Routed Amid Red Sea Disruptions\nSelected Shipping Routes - Monthly Number of Cargo & Tanker Ship Transits\nOne key alternative route is via the Cape of Good Hope. Despite its longer transit time and higher fuel costs, this route has experienced an 80% increase in cargo and tanker ship traffic from November 2023 to May 2024, underscoring the impact of conflicts in the Red Sea region. This shift creates investment opportunities in port facilities along the Atlantic-facing coast and potential growth for alternative land corridors like the Middle Corridor through Central Asia to Europe. While these routes will not significantly absorb canal traffic in the short-to-medium term, they offer viable alternatives to mitigate risks associated with conflict zones. Shipping in the Black Sea faces high insurance premiums due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, with naval blockades, missile strikes and sea mines contributing to elevated risks and freight rates. Ships are taking longer, costlier routes, resulting in delays and higher fuel consumption. Damage to Ukrainian port infrastructure has reduced export capacities, disrupting global supply chains and increasing costs. Sanctions and countersanctions further complicate logistics.\nConflicts along key maritime routes have forced shipping companies to use larger vessels on longer transits, increasing risks of incidents, port congestion and impacting global supply chains. Geopolitical tensions have increased costs for shipping and transport companies in 2024, and we expect these costs to remain elevated. Factors such as higher insurance premiums, longer and costlier routes, and increased security measures will continue to drive expenses.\nKey View:\u00a0We anticipate a reduction in labour disruption risks impacting logistics and freight operations. This will be largely attributable to the decline in cost of living pressures and the more careful negotiations of labour contract agreements in 2024 in order to avoid significant disruptions to supply chains as was the case in 2023.\u00a0\nMid-Year Update: Global inflation is trending downwards, driven largely by DMs, which should lower the risk of disruptions to logistics networks. Many impactful labour unrest incidents in 2023 was a direct result of the cost-of-living crisis in DMs, prompting workers to push for higher wages. While large scale disruptions to major logistics and port activities have so far in 2024 been averted, there remains clusters of logistics workers demanding higher levels of compensation, demanding better working conditions, and pushing back against automation. The main risk for H2 2024 is expiry of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association agreement, which covers 45,000 dockworkers at major US East and Gulf Coast ports, on September 30 2024. Progress on sealing a new deal came to a halt in June 2024, when talks were suspended by the union.\nOther labour unrest risks across H2 2024 include rail workers from Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City, Tata Steel workers at the UK\u2019s Port Talbot, and new collective labour agreements for workers at Germany\u2019s ports of Hamburg, Bremen, Bremerhaven, Brake, and Emden. Furthermore, we anticipate that geopolitical risks and their associated implications, as detailed in our Geopolitical Risks theme, will give rise to demands for hardship or hazard compensation for shipworkers traversing the Red Sea. There are also the risk of pro-Palestinian activist strikes in and around ports - Italy\u2019s Port of Genoa was blocked in a strike in June 2024, with similar protests happening earlier in the year in Australia and Canada, though they are generally small in scale.\nUptick In Unrest Should Subside In H2 2024\nGlobal - Number Of Demonstrations By Civilians & Protestors\nAutomation is increasingly seen as a solution to labour shortages and unrest in the logistics sector, particularly in DMs. While automation is expected to reduce labour needs and operational disruptions caused by strikes, resistance from workers and unions remains a significant barrier, especially in Europe and North America. According to our Megatrends Survey, a majority of transport and logistics industry respondents recognise technology and automation as major disruptors through 2025 and are preparing for this shift, with over a quarter already investing in artifical intelligence and automation to enhance resilience against workforce challenges.\nAutomation Underway In Supply Chain Management\nGlobal - Annual Installations Of Industrial Robots (2017-2026)\n This commentary is published by BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, and is not a comment on Fitch Ratings Credit Ratings.
