[+] ofthe stock market. Tesla is listed in Nasdaq. The Nasdaq is the second-largest stock exchange in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo by Alexander Pohl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nDespite Tesla\u2019s\nTSLA\nstock having lost more than 60% of its value since November 2021, recent analyst reports from JPMorgan indicate that the stock would have to drop by at least 35% more from its current level to reach fundamental value. However, a behavioral analysis of the report\u2019s methodology suggests that the number might be closer to 75% than 35%.\nTwo psychological elements underlie the behavioral analysis of the report. Both were emphasized by the late psychologist Daniel Kahneman. The first is downplaying base rates, and the second is representativeness. Base rates refer to the rates at which relevant events have occurred in the past. Representativeness is the misuse of stereotypic thinking.\nBack Of The Envelope Calculation\nWhile some investors like to dig into the details of analyst reports, many do not. For those who do not, this section presents a brief back of the envelope calculation to register the point about Tesla\u2019s potential overvaluation. Readers who just want a quick sense of the issue can read this section and skip to the conclusion.\nDuring April 2024, the JPMorgan reports on Tesla estimate that at the end of 2024, Tesla\u2019s enterprise value will be $331,483 million. A key input in arriving at this value is an estimate of the minimum level of future profitability Tesla\u2019s investors would find acceptable.\nHere acceptable profitability is measured by a rate of return, the cost of capital. Actual profitability is measured by the return on invested capital. When they are equal, the firm is said to exactly earn its cost of capital.\nBillionaire Mark Cuban Issues Post Halving Bitcoin Warning Amid\nUnprecedented\nCrypto Fee Price\nChaos\nAEW Dynasty 2024 Results\nWinners And Grades As Swerve Makes History\nWho Is David Pecker\nWhy He s Testifying Against Trump In Hush Money Trial\nThe base rate issue is that in the long run, most companies do not earn more than their cost of capital. That is, return on invested capital does not exceed the cost of capital.\nIf the JPMorgan analysts expect that Tesla will exactly earn its cost of capital going forward, then there is a straightforward calculation to estimate its fundamental value at the end of 2024: Simply divide the estimate of Tesla\u2019s 2025 value of EBIT after tax, or EBI, by Tesla\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. The report also estimates Tesla\u2019s EBIT during 2025 to be $12,792 million and its WACC to be 11.8%. The result is $108,406 million, which is roughly one third of the JPMorgan estimate.\nI suggest a reason why the JPMorgan estimate of enterprise value could be three times the estimate from the simple formula: The JPMorgan analysts assume that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital going forward. Is the assumption reasonable? The evidence presented below suggests not.\nTesla\u2019s Return On Invested Capital\nPrior to 2020, Tesla\u2019s return on invested capital was negative. In 2020, it barely turned positive. However, in 2021, it rose to 14%, then to 23% in 2022 and then dropped slightly to 20% in 2023. Therefore, in the last three years, Tesla did indeed earn more than its cost of capital.\nHowever, Tesla\u2019s situation has changed. The JPMorgan analysts gave Tesla\u2019s stock a recommendation of Underweight, indicating that Tesla\u2019s deteriorating fundamentals relate to decreased demand for its vehicles, not decreased supply. The New York Times\nNYT\ndescribes how Tesla is now facing stiff competition for electric vehicles from American, Korean, Chinese and European automobile manufacturers, such as Ford, BYD, and BMW. These firms all have big EV product lines and growing sales. Indeed, during the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD briefly became the world\u2019s largest seller of EVs.\nStandard textbooks in economics and finance clearly state that for a company to earn more than its cost of capital in the long run, it must have some sustainable competitive advantage. Companies that earn more than their costs of capital attract competitors, and competition puts downward pressure on prices and profit margins. Tesla is now cutting prices and profit margins to compete with its competitors. Going forward, this decision will place significant pressure on the company\u2019s ROIC.\nReturn On Capital, Base Rates, And Representativeness\nComputing enterprise value requires a focus on the long run. Consider this question: Over the long run, what percentage of publicly traded companies earn more than Treasury bills? This is a question about a base rate.\nFinancial economist Hank Bessembinder\u2019s work provides the answer, which is 4%. Think of 4% as the base rate. Put another way, over the long run, 96% of publicly traded stocks fail to outperform the Treasury bill rate.\nAmazon\nAMZN\nand Apple\nAAPL\nearn more than Treasury bills. In May 2017, analysts at Morgan Stanley\nMS\nmade the following statement: \u201cThe bull case on Tesla is that it can become the next Amazon or Apple.\u201d The title of the report is \u201cThe Price of Ambition: Downgrade to EW.\u201d Keep in mind that the simple valuation formula refers to companies earning their cost of capital, not earning the rate on Treasury bills. So, the question for valuing Tesla becomes whether it is reasonable to expect that going forward, the firm\u2019s ROIC will match its 11.8% cost of capital. Given the base rate, the odds are against it.\nIn respect to representativeness, Amazon and Apple serve as stereotypes. Analysts and investors rely on representativeness for their judgments when they do two things. First, they view Amazon and Apple as emblematic of companies with the highest performing stocks. Second they make valuation judgements about Tesla based on their perceptions of how representative is Tesla of the class of companies having the highest performing stocks.\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Analysis\nThe analysts at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley do not use the simple valuation EBI/WACC-formula which I described above. Instead, they use a free cash flow counterpart, which applies a multiple to an estimate of a future free cash flow. For example, the JPMorgan analysts apply a multiple of 83 to their 2025-free cash flow estimate of $2,571 million for Tesla.\nAs a general matter, applying a multiple is fine, as long as the multiple is reasonable. The thing about using 83 is that it implies an expectation that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital going forward. That is why, I suggest, the JPMorgan estimate of $100 per share for Tesla\u2019s fundamental enterprise value is too high.\nIt is straightforward to ascertain the value of the multiple corresponding to any firm exactly earning its cost of capital. First, estimate the long-term growth rate for the company\u2019s free cash flow. Call this g. Compute the ratio (1+g)/(WACC-g). Now tie g to the assumption that the firm will exactly earn its cost of capital. The textbook formula for g in this case is g = retention rate x WACC. The retention rate is the ratio of a company\u2019s capital expenditures net of depreciation to the sum of its unlevered free cash flow and capex net of depreciation.\nAnalysts routinely assume values for free cash flow growth rates that are higher than the textbook formula. Moreover, these assumptions are buried in the multiples they use. If you do the math, you will discover that JPMorgan\u2019s implicit value of g is 11% per year. The textbook formula indicates that if Tesla is expected to earn its costs of capital exactly, the corresponding value of g would be 8.4%. Using 11% for g when 8.4% is warranted is a bias known as growth opportunities bias.\nUsing 8.4% will produce an estimate of enterprise value for Tesla that is in the neighborhood of what you get using the simple EBI/WACC formula. Try it.\nTesla\u2019s free cash flows were negative until 2018. Once positive, they grew quickly through 2021. In 2020, they grew at 128.6% and in 2021 at 19.7%. However, in 2022 growth turned negative at -25.5%, and in 2023 it dropped further to -175.9%.\nSentiment\nThe upshot of the Tesla\u2019s fundamental value being so far below its market price is that Tesla\u2019s price mostly reflects optimistic sentiment. On this point, the JPMorgan report establishes a December 2024 target price for Tesla\u2019s stock of $115, not $100. In this respect, the report\u2019s methodology arrives at $115 by taking a 50-50 combination of its $100 estimate of DCF-based fundamental value and a $130 estimate based on multiples such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales. The multiples approach captures market-wide sentiment, but not sentiment unique to Tesla.\nBehavioral asset pricing theory focuses on the decomposition of market prices into a fundamental component and a sentiment component. The target price approach I favor would place a lower weight on fundamental value computed using the EBI/WACC formula, a higher weight on the multiples approach, and the addition of a component to account for Tesla-specific sentiment.\nThe Tesla-specific component is important. For years, the JPMorgan analysts have assigned Tesla\u2019s stock a recommendation of Underweight. This was the case in July 2020 when Tesla\u2019s stock was trading at $1,592. At the time, the JPMorgan analysts\u2019 target price was $325, 80% below the market price. Its estimate of fundamental value per share was $295 and its multiple-based counterpart was $356. Remember, 2020 was a time when Tesla\u2019s free cash flow growth was high, and its ROIC had just turned positive. In July 2021, a year, later, Tesla\u2019s stock increased by 140%, vividly demonstrating the power of sentiment. It is a mistake to think that prices revert to fundamental value quickly, or even move in the right direction.\nGeneral Takeaways\nSentiment refers to biased reactions to changing fundamentals. The history of Tesla\u2019s stock illustrates just how important sentiment can be in the short-to-medium terms.\nAnalysts might serve the investing public better, for all stocks, not just Tesla, by structuring the valuation portions of their reports to decompose target prices into fundamental and sentiment components. In doing so, they could also be transparent about base rates for ROIC and free cash flow growth rates. Specifically, they can exercise caution about giving due weight to base rates and avoiding representativeness bias, in an effort to mitigate growth opportunity bias. Doing so just might lead market prices to more accurately reflect their corresponding fundamental values.\nI contacted Media Relations at JPMorgan to offer the firm an opportunity to respond to the points in this post. However, the firm\u2019s policy is not to comment on the methodology in analyst reports.",

A key input in this valuation is the minimum level of future profitability Tesla\u2019s investors would find acceptable, measured by the cost of capital. The report also estimates Tesla\u2019s EBIT during 2025 to be $12,792 million and its WACC to be 11.8%, resulting in a fundamental value of $108,406 million, roughly one-third of the JPMorgan estimate.\n\nTesla\u2019s return on invested capital (ROIC) was negative prior to 2020, barely positive in 2020, and rose to 14% in 2021, 23% in 2022, and slightly dropped to 20% in 2023. However, Tesla now faces stiff competition from other EV manufacturers, leading to price cuts and pressure on profit margins. This competition challenges the assumption that Tesla will continue to earn more than its cost of capital.\n\nFinancial economist Hank Bessembinder\u2019s work shows that only 4% of publicly traded companies earn more than Treasury bills in the long run. Given this base rate, it is unlikely that Tesla will continue to outperform. Analysts often use representativeness, comparing Tesla to high-performing companies like Amazon and Apple, which can lead to biased valuations.\n\nJPMorgan and Morgan Stanley analysts use a discounted free cash flow analysis, applying a multiple to future free cash flow estimates. JPMorgan\u2019s multiple of 83 implies an expectation that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital. However, using a more conservative growth rate of 8.4% instead of 11% would produce a lower enterprise value estimate.\n\nTesla\u2019s free cash flows were negative until 2018, grew quickly through 2021, but turned negative in 2022 and 2023. The JPMorgan report sets a December 2024 target price for Tesla\u2019s stock at $115, combining a $100 estimate of fundamental value and a $130 estimate based on market sentiment. Behavioral asset pricing theory suggests that Tesla\u2019s market price reflects optimistic sentiment rather than fundamental value.\n\nIn summary, sentiment plays a significant role in Tesla\u2019s stock price. Analysts should decompose target prices into fundamental and sentiment components, be transparent about base rates, and avoid representativeness bias to provide more accurate valuations.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months.

All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question.

The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

    "Document": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do?

QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nRather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments\u00a0at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases.\nInvest in wellness\nA rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging).\nPropel the social\u2013digital experience\nCompanies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries)\u00a0become more important.\nWe see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level.

    "Summarized_Document": "If you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands. These are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed. In this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d Nine trends defining the global consumer market To forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth. Who is the future consumer? Consumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved. 1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend. Among this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies. This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies. 2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood. Despite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age. In emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets said they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe and 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk. 3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.

    "Document": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives:\nBuild microtargeting capabilities\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\nQuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nRather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments\u00a0at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases.\nInvest in wellness\nA rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging).\nPropel the social\u2013digital experience\nCompanies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries)\u00a0become more important.\nWe see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers.\nOffer premium products where they matter\nOffering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures.\nIn this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.\nThe authors wish to thank Cait Pearson, Heather Gouinlock, and Keir Sullivan for their contributions to this article.\nThis article was edited by Alexandra Mondalek, an editor in the New York office.",

Attempts to grow the social-commerce market in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months. Four imperatives to win the consumer of the future In light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives: Build microtargeting capabilities About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Rather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases. Invest in wellness A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging). Propel the social\u2013digital experience Companies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries) become more important. We see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers. Offer premium products where they matter Offering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures. In this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.

    "Document": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do?

High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age. In emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets said they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe and 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk. 3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers. This intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers. What will consumers want? What consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies. 4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups. In advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts. Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior. This weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers. One beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality. 5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims outpaced sales of products without such claims. While young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023. Younger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims. 6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually. In advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets. In emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States. It\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so. Weight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years. By 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective. 7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually by 2040. A higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well. Where will consumers shop? Knowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world. 8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend. Just because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas. Emerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world. 9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind. Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States. Attempts to grow the social-commerce market in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months. Four imperatives to win the consumer of the future In light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives: Build microtargeting capabilities About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Rather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases. Invest in wellness A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging). Propel the social\u2013digital experience Companies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries) become more important. We see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers. Offer premium products where they matter Offering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures. In this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.

It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\nPerhaps the \"most encouraging\" news for consumers is that inflation for household necessities has cooled dramatically, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n\"The prices for staples \u00e2\u20ac\u201d food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they haven't changed in about a year,\" Zandi said. \"So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.\"\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n\"We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,\" Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week.\nHowever, additional improvements are likely to be \"slow-going,\" they wrote.\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their\u00c2\u00a0highest level\u00c2\u00a0in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation.\nLast month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024.\n\"All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,\" Zandi said.\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\nGasoline played a large role in June's inflation pullback.\nPrices fell 3.8% in June relative to May, according to CPI data. That follows a 3.6% decline the prior month.\n\"Tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs\" have led to weaker gas prices, AAA wrote in June.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why Fed policy may make your next trip abroad more expensiveInflation largely isn't Biden or Trump's fault, say economistsMore Americans are struggling even as inflation cools\nAverage U.S. pump prices fell to $3.48 a gallon as of July 1, down from $3.52 on June 3, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.\nGasoline prices are down 2.5% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store.\n\"Food at home\" prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nConsumers have more \"breathing room\" at the store amid \"growing promotional activity\" among retailers, while a few \"major\" companies recently announced price cuts \"that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,\" wrote economists House and George.\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends.\nThey also generally like to examine \"core\" inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThe monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.\n\"Core\" CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI.\nShelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said.\nThe shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it.\nHowever, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021.\n\"It should continue to cool off,\" said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n\"It just takes time,\" he added.\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment.\nIt is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment.\n\"The goods side looks very benign at the moment,\" said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. \"Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.\"\nFor example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a \"notable\" 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\nIt also takes a long time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a year, two or even three \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\nThe services sector is generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market such as strong wage growth.\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades. The labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though it remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n\"Inflationary pressure from the labor market has dissipated quite strongly,\" Cross said.\nDon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

'So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.'\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n'We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,' Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week.\nHowever, additional improvements are likely to be 'slow-going,' they wrote.\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their highest level in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation.\nLast month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024.\n'All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,' Zandi said.\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\nGasoline played a large role in June's inflation pullback.\nPrices fell 3.8% in June relative to May, according to CPI data. That follows a 3.6% decline the prior month.\n'Tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs' have led to weaker gas prices, AAA wrote in June.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why Fed policy may make your next trip abroad more expensiveInflation largely isn't Biden or Trump's fault, say economistsMore Americans are struggling even as inflation cools\nAverage U.S. pump prices fell to $3.48 a gallon as of July 1, down from $3.52 on June 3, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.\nGasoline prices are down 2.5% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store.\n'Food at home' prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nConsumers have more 'breathing room' at the store amid 'growing promotional activity' among retailers, while a few 'major' companies recently announced price cuts 'that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,' wrote economists House and George.\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends.\nThey also generally like to examine 'core' inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThe monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.\n'Core' CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI.\nShelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said.\nThe shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it.\nHowever, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \u2014 lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \u2014 from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021.\n'It should continue to cool off,' said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n'It just takes time,' he added.\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment.\nIt is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment.\n'The goods side looks very benign at the moment,' said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. 'Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.'\nFor example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a 'notable' 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\nIt also takes a long time \u2014 a year, two or even three \u2014 for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\nThe services sector is generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market such as strong wage growth.\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades. The labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though it remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n'Inflationary pressure from the labor market has dissipated quite strongly,' Cross said.\nDon't miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\nPerhaps the \"most encouraging\" news for consumers is that inflation for household necessities has cooled dramatically, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n\"The prices for staples \u00e2\u20ac\u201d food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they haven't changed in about a year,\" Zandi said. \"So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.\"\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n\"We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,\" Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week.\nHowever, additional improvements are likely to be \"slow-going,\" they wrote.\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their\u00c2\u00a0highest level\u00c2\u00a0in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation.\nLast month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024.\n\"All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,\" Zandi said.\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\nGasoline played a large role in June's inflation pullback.\nPrices fell 3.8% in June relative to May, according to CPI data. That follows a 3.6% decline the prior month.\n\"Tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs\" have led to weaker gas prices, AAA wrote in June.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why Fed policy may make your next trip abroad more expensiveInflation largely isn't Biden or Trump's fault, say economistsMore Americans are struggling even as inflation cools\nAverage U.S. pump prices fell to $3.48 a gallon as of July 1, down from $3.52 on June 3, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.\nGasoline prices are down 2.5% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store.\n\"Food at home\" prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nConsumers have more \"breathing room\" at the store amid \"growing promotional activity\" among retailers, while a few \"major\" companies recently announced price cuts \"that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,\" wrote economists House and George.\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends.\nThey also generally like to examine \"core\" inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThe monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.\n\"Core\" CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI.\nShelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said.\nThe shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it.\nHowever, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021.\n\"It should continue to cool off,\" said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n\"It just takes time,\" he added.\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment.\nIt is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment.\n\"The goods side looks very benign at the moment,\" said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. \"Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.\"\nFor example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a \"notable\" 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\nIt also takes a long time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a year, two or even three \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\nThe services sector is generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market such as strong wage growth.\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades. The labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though it remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n\"Inflationary pressure from the labor market has dissipated quite strongly,\" Cross said.\nDon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

REUTERS/Hollie Adams/File Photo\n(Reuters) - British consumer confidence held at an almost three-year high in August, bolstered by improving sentiment around personal finances and major purchases, according to a survey on Friday that added to positive signals in the wider economy.\nThe GfK Consumer Confidence Index, Britain's longest-running gauge of economic morale among members of the public, was steady in August at -13, matching July's 34-month high. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of -12.\nThe survey follows mostly positive data from companies since Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party won a landslide election victory last month. Business surveys put the economy on course for solid growth in the second half of 2024.\nThe survey's measure of enthusiasm for major purchases rose to its highest level since January 2022, while the outlook for personal finances also notched higher.\n\"This more positive outlook may be due to a mortgage-friendly interest rate cut at the beginning of August, and hopes of more to come,\" said Joe Staton, client strategy director at market research company GfK.\nThe BoE cut borrowing costs from a 16-year high of 5.25% earlier this month but Governor Andrew Bailey and other top officials have signalled they might not follow that up with rapid further reductions in rates.\nInvestors were assigning a less than 30% chance of a September rate cut on Thursday.\nA Reuters poll of economists published on Wednesday suggested the BoE will cut interest rates just once more this year, in November.\nThe GfK report's gauges of past and future economic sentiment cooled, however.\nThe survey of 2,003 people took place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 15.\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by David Milliken)\nCopyright 2024 Thomson Reuters.\nSponsored Bank Accounts\nTags: United Kingdom, Europe\nCredit Cards\nPersonal Loans \nMortgages\nBanking\n\n    Comparative assessments and other editorial opinions are those of U.S. News\n    and have not been previously reviewed, approved or endorsed by any other\n    entities, such as banks, credit card issuers or travel companies.

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6).

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). Methods used to identify pediatric influenza-coded deaths on death certificates differ from those used to identify the influenza-associated pediatric deaths presented below, which require laboratory confirmation of influenza, and might not include the same individuals. One laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated death in a child <18 years of age was reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received nine reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths among children <18 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season. Influenza-associated Outbreaks Two laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks were reported during Week 11. To date, 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported to CDPH during the 2023\u20132024 season. One previously reported outbreak was removed because it did not meet the outbreak definition. Figure 9.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10.

These laboratories report the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza and other respiratory virus detections and isolations on a weekly basis. The overall percentage of influenza detections in clinical sentinel laboratories during Week 11 was 5.0% compared to 5.2% during Week 10 (Figure 1). Additional details, including influenza typing and subtyping information from public health laboratories can be found in Figures 1 and 2 and Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1.

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6). The percentage of deaths coded as influenza during Week 11 was 0.0% compared to 0.1% during Week 10 (Figure 7).\n4 24 1 24 104 1 25 166 28 34 520 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Deaths ICU Non-ICU Percentage of Influenza Hospitalizations Severity of Hospitalization <18 years 18-49 years 50-64 years \u226565 years 9 of 20 Figure 6.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10. Percentage of Influenza-like Illness Visits among Patients Seen by Sentinel Providers \u2014 California Border Region, 2018\u20132024 Season to Date Virologic Surveillance Update The percentage of influenza detections in border region clinical sentinel laboratories during Week 11 was 5.0% (Figure 11).

Figure 12. Percentage of RSV Detections at Clinical Sentinel Laboratories, 2018\u20132024 Season to Date RSV Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cRSV,\u201d \u201csyncytial,\u201d \u201cbronchiolitis,\u201d and variants of the keywords are defined as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related admissions. The number of RSV admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same period to estimate the percentage of RSV admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator.

RSV-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are likely to be an underestimate of all RSV-associated deaths. During Week 11, ten RSV-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 295 RSV-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 15). The percentage of deaths coded as RSV during Week 11 was 0.11% compared to 0.19% during Week 10 (Figure 16). Figure 15.

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6).

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). Methods used to identify pediatric influenza-coded deaths on death certificates differ from those used to identify the influenza-associated pediatric deaths presented below, which require laboratory confirmation of influenza, and might not include the same individuals. One laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated death in a child <18 years of age was reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received nine reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths among children <18 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season. Influenza-associated Outbreaks Two laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks were reported during Week 11. To date, 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported to CDPH during the 2023\u20132024 season.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10.

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

    "Document_ID": "DOC_20",
    "Document": "New COVID vaccines are here. What to know about latest shots in wake of nation\u2019s biggest summer surge\nOn the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers.\nBack in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early.\nManufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use.\nIn considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants.\n\u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d\nWho can get a new COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children:\nAdults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults.\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses.\nI recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine?\nYes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months.\nHowever, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area.\nI just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one?\nFor people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician.\nIf you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated.\nAre the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same?\nBoth use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them.\nComirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nSpikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nAll new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine?\nWhile the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift.\n\u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d\nTaking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2.\nI got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine?\nYes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter.\nIn the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d\nHopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity.\n\u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19.\n\u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d\nCan you get COVID from the vaccine?\nNo. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d\nBecause younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body.\nBen-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d\nCan I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time?\nYes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d\nCan I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated?\nYes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death.\nDoes insurance cover the new COVID vaccine?\nThe vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program.\nThe 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients.\n\u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d\nWhere can I get the new COVID vaccine?\nVisit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829.\nDo I still need a COVID vaccination card?\nIf you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones.\nThe CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.\nFor more on COVID-19 and vaccines:\nSubscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.

While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses. I recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine? Yes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months. However, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area. I just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one? For people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician. If you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated. Are the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same? Both use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them. Comirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA. Spikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA. All new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. What\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine? While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift. \u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d Taking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2. I got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine? Yes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter. In the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d Hopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity. \u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19. \u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d Can you get COVID from the vaccine? No. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains. \u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d Because younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body. Ben-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d Can I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time? Yes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d Can I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated? Yes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Does insurance cover the new COVID vaccine? The vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program. The 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients. \u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d Where can I get the new COVID vaccine? Visit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829. Do I still need a COVID vaccination card? If you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones. The CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.

    "Document": "New COVID vaccines are here. What to know about latest shots in wake of nation\u2019s biggest summer surge\nOn the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers.\nBack in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early.\nManufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use.\nIn considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants.\n\u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d\nWho can get a new COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children:\nAdults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults.\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart.

    "Summarized_Document": "On the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers. Back in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early. Manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use. In considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants. \u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d Who can get a new COVID vaccine? The CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children: Adults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults. People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses. I recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine? Yes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months. However, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area. I just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one? For people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician. If you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated. Are the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same? Both use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them. Comirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA. Spikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA. All new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. What\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine? While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift. \u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d Taking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2. I got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine? Yes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter. In the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d Hopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity. \u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19. \u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d Can you get COVID from the vaccine? No. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains. \u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d Because younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body. Ben-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d Can I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time? Yes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d Can I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated? Yes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Does insurance cover the new COVID vaccine? The vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program. The 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients. \u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d Where can I get the new COVID vaccine? Visit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829. Do I still need a COVID vaccination card? If you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones. The CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.

The market provides the value (in USD million) for the above-mentioned segments.\n\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Analysis\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is expected to register a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period (2021 to 2026).\nThe COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on people with hypertension. Also, due to lockdown and other restrictions imposed by governements to curb the spread of the infection from the Covid-19 virus, the lifestyle of patients with hypertension was severely impacted. As per the study titled \"COVID-19 in Patients with Hypertension\" published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology in July 2021, hypertension individuals who have COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality that is at least two times higher; nevertheless, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors that have been offer protection for this subgroup of patients which in turn expected to boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nOne of the leading factors responsible for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market is the rising prevalence of hypertension among people around the world. The major known causes of hypertension are kidney diseases, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and other cardiovascular diseases due to which the prevalence of hypertension has been observed a significant rise over the past few years. Also, some drugs can induce hypertension in patients with other diseases or disorders which in turn is expected to promote the growth of the studied market. As per the updated May 2021 data from the World Health Organization, about 1.13 billion people around the world have hypertension, of which two-third are living in low- and middle-income countries. In the report published in June 2020 titled 'A Global View on Prevalence of Hypertension and Human Development Index' to determine the relationship between the prevalence of hypertension and human development index (HDI) concluded that the prevalence of hypertension ranged from 35% to 41% among 182 countries around the world. Thus, the rising prevalence of hypertension is expected to drive the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nCertain other factors that will boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market include growing initiatives by private and government organizations and rising awareness about hypertension around the around. For instance, in May 2022, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals conclude the hypertension awareness symbol backed by the Association of Physicians of India (API) and Hypertension Society of India (HIS). Additionally, in May 2022, Namya Smile Foundation (NSF) organized an awareness campaign in India related to hypertension among people. The organization conducted a camp and checked the blood pressure and made them aware of various aspects of high blood pressure.\nWhereas factors such as expiration of patent of multiple major drugs along with side effects associated with the hypertension treatment and rise in the availability of other non-pharmacological based therapy will restrict the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market. For Instance, In December 2021, AbbVie, the parent company of Allergan, lost the patent of its anti-hypertensive drug, Bystolic (Nebivolol). Nebivolol is a beta blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Additionally, market participants frequently introduce new products and use a variety of growth tactics in their particular segments, which is likely to spur market expansion. For Instance, in December 2021, Dr Reddy's Laboratories has launched Valsartan tablets, used for treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, in the United States market. The Valsartan tablet is the generic therapeutic equivalent of Diovan, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Similarly, in November 2021, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. reported that Novartis Pharma K.K. (Novartis Pharma) has obtained approval in Japan for ENTREST 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets (generic name: sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate) for the new indication of hypertension. This approval is Japan's first of an ARNI for the indication of hypertension.\nThus, all aforementioned factors expected to boost the market growth over the forecast period, However, multiple major drug patent expiration expected to hamper the market growth.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Trends\n\n This section covers the major market trends shaping the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market according to our research experts: \n\nDiuretics Therapeutics Class is Expected to Hold a Significant Market Share in the Forecast Period\n\nDiuretics help in reducing the sodium and water from the body by inducing kidneys to release more sodium into the urine which leads to lower blood pressure as fluid flowing through the body is decreases. Diuretics are the preferred class of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of hypertension over others mainly because of their high efficacy, low cost, and low side effects as compared to other available therapeutic classes in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nDiuretics are of three types - thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics, from which thiazide diuretics are the cornerstone of treatment for hypertension in most patients around the world. For instance, as per the research article published in July 2022, titled 'Loop Diuretics', Loop diuretics have received FDA approval to be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensives to treat hypertension. However, first-line therapy does not consist solely of loop diuretics. Loop diuretics can be used to address fluid overload conditions and alternative hypertension therapy. Moreover, according to the study titled \"Thiazide diuretics alone or in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic on blood pressure-lowering in patients with primary hypertension: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis\" published in the BMC Open Journal in February 2022, Thiazides have a proven track record of lowering blood pressure, have a good safety record, and are inexpensive. This makes them a popular choice for pharmaceutical treatment. Hydrochlorothiazide has less antihypertensive effectiveness than chlorthalidone and indapamide. Thus,m due to above benefits of the diuretics in the management of hypertension is anticipated to boost the segmrent growth over the forecast period.\nTherefore, owing to the above-mentioned factors, the diuretics therapeutics class is expected to have highest growth as compared to others with the rise in the prevalence of hypertension cases around the world.\n\nNorth America is Expected to Dominate the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market Over the Forecast Period\n\nNorth America holds a major share in the anti-hypertensive drugs market and is expected to show a similar trend over the forecast period mainly due to the high prevalence of hypertension and diseases causing hypertension in the region. Additionally, the demand for prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, identifying people predisposed to the disease, presence of technically advanced healthcare infrastructure, and management of the prognosis of the disease are some of the key market drivers of the North American anti-hypertension market.\nIn North America, the United States will hold the largest market in anti-hypertensive drugs market in the region. In the United States, the rising prevalence of hypertension is the major reason for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drug market. As per the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention In July 2022, over half of adults (47 percent, or 116 million) have hypertension. Thus, the growing burden of hypertension in the United States is expected to rise in the demand anti-hypertensive drug thereby boost the market growth.\nThe other factors such as increasing awareness among the people about hypertension in the region. For instance, in November 2021, New public service announcements (PSAs) were released by the American Heart Association (AHA), American Medical Association (AMA), HHS Office of Minority Health (OMH), Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA), and the Ad Council to encourage people to take charge of their health by self-monitoring their blood pressure and talking with a healthcare provider about their numbers.\nAdditionally, various strategies adopted by the key market players such as product launches and merger and acquisistion supports the market growth. In April 2021, United Therapeutics Corporation announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration approved its drug for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease, known as Tyvaso (Treprostinil).\nThus, the North America is expected to hold major market share in the anti-hypertensive market.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Industry Overview\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is highly competitive due to the presence of a number of pharmaceutical companies. Companies such as AstraZeneca PLC, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, Johnson & Johnson Ltd, Lupin Limited, Merck KGaA ., Novartis AG, among others, hold a substantial market share in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Leaders\n\nPfizer Inc.\nC.H.

    "Summarized_Document": "Antihypertensive Drugs Market Size & Share Analysis - Growth Trends & Forecasts (2024 - 2029)\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% from 2021 to 2026. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted individuals with hypertension, increasing the demand for anti-hypertensive drugs. The rising prevalence of hypertension, driven by factors such as kidney diseases, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, is a major growth driver. According to the World Health Organization, about 1.13 billion people globally have hypertension, with two-thirds living in low- and middle-income countries. The prevalence of hypertension ranges from 35% to 41% among 182 countries.\n\nPrivate and government initiatives are also boosting market growth. For example, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals and the Namya Smile Foundation have conducted awareness campaigns in India. However, the expiration of patents for major drugs and the side effects associated with hypertension treatments are expected to restrain market growth. For instance, AbbVie lost the patent for its drug Bystolic in December 2021.\n\nDiuretics are expected to hold a significant market share due to their high efficacy, low cost, and minimal side effects. Thiazide diuretics, in particular, are widely used for hypertension treatment. North America is expected to dominate the market, driven by the high prevalence of hypertension and advanced healthcare infrastructure. The United States, where 47% of adults have hypertension, will hold the largest market share in the region.\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is highly competitive, with major players including Pfizer Inc., C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, Noden Pharma DAC, Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, and Merck KGaA. The market is segmented by therapeutic class (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, alpha blockers, renin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and other therapeutic classes) and geography (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and South America).\n\nThe report covers market dynamics, including drivers such as the increasing prevalence of hypertension and growing awareness, and restraints like drug patent expirations and side effects. It also includes a competitive landscape analysis and profiles of key companies. The market is expected to see significant growth in Asia-Pacific due to rising health awareness and an aging population.",

This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%).

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times. An effective reorder point helps fulfill orders quickly, protect margins, and keep customers satisfied.",

The report offers market size and values in (USD Billion) during the forecasted years for the above segments.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Analysis\nThe Beauty and Personal Care Products Market size is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 4.64% over the next five years.\nMillennials are increasingly using beauty products like color cosmetics as part of their regular grooming routines. For instance, as of 2021, according to financial comparison service provider Mozo, the average Australian woman spent approximately USD 3,600 on beauty and personal care products yearly. The simple accessibility of these cosmetic items through various sales channels, with the increased emphasis on personal grooming, aided the sales value. Furthermore, the emergence of cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic components helped the market expansion. With the rising awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products, consumers are inclined toward organic personal care products. It is expected to drive market growth during the study period. Besides this, companies are capitalizing on consumers' demands to expand their share and consumer base in the market. For instance, in February 2022, a United Kingdom-based fashion company, Boohoo, launched a vegan beauty range of more than 50 products. Boohoo Beauty's cosmetics line includes highlighter sticks, blush, setting sprays, cosmetic palettes, and others available exclusively.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends\nInclination toward Natural/Organic Formulations\nThe growing concerns regarding the side effects of chemicals in personal care products, leading to skin irritation, allergies, and dullness, fueled the demand for natural and organic skincare products. Prolonged use of synthetic cosmetics may cause various health issues, such as irritation, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity. However, cosmetic products made of organic ingredients, such as plant extracts and natural oils, do not harm the skin. Natural skincare and cosmetic products that are free from chemicals and transparent about the content are preferred by consumers. This factor resulted in a shift in preference from synthetic skincare products to organic products among consumers.\nTo capitalize on this growing interest, manufacturers are revamping and expanding their product offerings by introducing a wide range of organic skincare products. These products contain plant-based, clean-label ingredients with organic, vegan, natural, chemical-free, and cruelty-free claims. For instance, in April 2022, Shiseido revealed a new skincare brand, Ul\u00e9. It sources pesticide-free botanicals from local vertical farms. The dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits of natural skincare led consumers to seek eco-friendly, sustainable, natural skincare products that offer greater product ingredient transparency. Furthermore, the growing trend of organic concepts through online stores for bio-cosmetic products is expected to boost the growth of the natural and organic beauty and personal care products market.\nAsia-Pacific Emerges as the Fastest-growing Region\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries like China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam present considerable growth opportunities for the market players. It is primarily due to the growing demand for color cosmetics, as many people unleash the potential of cosmetics in their daily makeup routine. Hence, the significant players are intensely embarking on product innovation and mergers and acquisitions as their prime strategy to consolidate the market. For instance, in April 2023, Personal care and beauty brand The Body Shop launched its 'activist' product range in the Indian market. The new line strengthens the brand's sustainable commitment in the country with a selection of skin products and color cosmetics.\nFurthermore, growing awareness regarding cosmetics products, such as facial makeup, hairstyling, and coloring products, with increasing demand for clean labels and natural ingredients, is expected to drive the market shortly. The need for multifunctional products is driving innovation as price-conscious consumers are opting for products that provide hydration and skin protection. The trend of social media influencers showcasing their beauty regimens increased over the past few years. Thus, both local and international beauty companies are turning to influencers to increase their brand awareness and reach potential consumers. For instance, in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, the Honest Company, a clean lifestyle company founded by Jessica Alba, launched its business in China. To capitalize on the relatively small but rising demand for sanitary beauty products, the digitally native company created a flagship store on Tmall Global, Alibaba Group's cross-border e-commerce platform. Chinese shoppers can purchase skin care and color cosmetics from Honest's brand, Honest Beauty. Shoppers on Tmall Global can select from various stock-keeping units, including its Extreme Length Mascara + Lash Primer and Hydrogel Cream, a face cream enriched with hyaluronic acid.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Industry Overview\nThe global beauty and personal care market is highly competitive, with a strong presence of regional and international players in the market like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. Demand is mainly driven by more adaptation toward skincare routines and consumer awareness about brand know-how. The companies improved the quality and product innovation regarding ingredients, functionality, and packaging. The key players are embarking on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation as their key strategies to achieve consolidation and optimize offerings. Moreover, these players merge with local players to gain dominance in the local market.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Leaders\nThe Procter & Gamble Company\nL'Oreal SA\nUnilever PLC\nColgate-Palmolive Company\nThe Estee Lauder Companies\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market News\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

The report offers market size and values in (USD Billion) during the forecasted years for the above segments.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Analysis\nThe Beauty and Personal Care Products Market size is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 4.64% over the next five years.\nMillennials are increasingly using beauty products like color cosmetics as part of their regular grooming routines. For instance, as of 2021, according to financial comparison service provider Mozo, the average Australian woman spent approximately USD 3,600 on beauty and personal care products yearly. The simple accessibility of these cosmetic items through various sales channels, with the increased emphasis on personal grooming, aided the sales value. Furthermore, the emergence of cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic components helped the market expansion. With the rising awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products, consumers are inclined toward organic personal care products. It is expected to drive market growth during the study period. Besides this, companies are capitalizing on consumers' demands to expand their share and consumer base in the market. For instance, in February 2022, a United Kingdom-based fashion company, Boohoo, launched a vegan beauty range of more than 50 products. Boohoo Beauty's cosmetics line includes highlighter sticks, blush, setting sprays, cosmetic palettes, and others available exclusively.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends\nInclination toward Natural/Organic Formulations\nThe growing concerns regarding the side effects of chemicals in personal care products, leading to skin irritation, allergies, and dullness, fueled the demand for natural and organic skincare products. Prolonged use of synthetic cosmetics may cause various health issues, such as irritation, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity. However, cosmetic products made of organic ingredients, such as plant extracts and natural oils, do not harm the skin. Natural skincare and cosmetic products that are free from chemicals and transparent about the content are preferred by consumers. This factor resulted in a shift in preference from synthetic skincare products to organic products among consumers.\nTo capitalize on this growing interest, manufacturers are revamping and expanding their product offerings by introducing a wide range of organic skincare products. These products contain plant-based, clean-label ingredients with organic, vegan, natural, chemical-free, and cruelty-free claims. For instance, in April 2022, Shiseido revealed a new skincare brand, Ul\u00e9. It sources pesticide-free botanicals from local vertical farms. The dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits of natural skincare led consumers to seek eco-friendly, sustainable, natural skincare products that offer greater product ingredient transparency. Furthermore, the growing trend of organic concepts through online stores for bio-cosmetic products is expected to boost the growth of the natural and organic beauty and personal care products market.\nAsia-Pacific Emerges as the Fastest-growing Region\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries like China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam present considerable growth opportunities for the market players. It is primarily due to the growing demand for color cosmetics, as many people unleash the potential of cosmetics in their daily makeup routine. Hence, the significant players are intensely embarking on product innovation and mergers and acquisitions as their prime strategy to consolidate the market. For instance, in April 2023, Personal care and beauty brand The Body Shop launched its 'activist' product range in the Indian market. The new line strengthens the brand's sustainable commitment in the country with a selection of skin products and color cosmetics.\nFurthermore, growing awareness regarding cosmetics products, such as facial makeup, hairstyling, and coloring products, with increasing demand for clean labels and natural ingredients, is expected to drive the market shortly. The need for multifunctional products is driving innovation as price-conscious consumers are opting for products that provide hydration and skin protection. The trend of social media influencers showcasing their beauty regimens increased over the past few years. Thus, both local and international beauty companies are turning to influencers to increase their brand awareness and reach potential consumers. For instance, in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, the Honest Company, a clean lifestyle company founded by Jessica Alba, launched its business in China. To capitalize on the relatively small but rising demand for sanitary beauty products, the digitally native company created a flagship store on Tmall Global, Alibaba Group's cross-border e-commerce platform. Chinese shoppers can purchase skin care and color cosmetics from Honest's brand, Honest Beauty. Shoppers on Tmall Global can select from various stock-keeping units, including its Extreme Length Mascara + Lash Primer and Hydrogel Cream, a face cream enriched with hyaluronic acid.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Industry Overview\nThe global beauty and personal care market is highly competitive, with a strong presence of regional and international players in the market like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. Demand is mainly driven by more adaptation toward skincare routines and consumer awareness about brand know-how. The companies improved the quality and product innovation regarding ingredients, functionality, and packaging. The key players are embarking on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation as their key strategies to achieve consolidation and optimize offerings. Moreover, these players merge with local players to gain dominance in the local market.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Leaders\nThe Procter & Gamble Company\nL'Oreal SA\nUnilever PLC\nColgate-Palmolive Company\nThe Estee Lauder Companies\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market News\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Beauty and Personal Care Products Market is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 4.64%. The market is driven by millennials' increasing use of beauty products and the accessibility of these products through various sales channels. The demand for natural, non-toxic, and organic components is rising due to awareness of the harmful effects of chemicals. Companies are expanding their product offerings to include organic skincare products. For instance, Boohoo launched a vegan beauty range in February 2022. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam, is the fastest-growing market due to the increasing demand for color cosmetics and the influence of social media. Major players in the market include Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. The market is segmented by product type, distribution channel, category, and geography. Seasonal trends between May 2024 and September 2024 affected Unilever's demand forecasts for personal care products, with increased demand during summer months due to higher usage of skincare and grooming products. The market is highly competitive, with companies focusing on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation to maintain their market position.",

Cooper said Walmart has an end-to-end grocery supply chain that includes an upstream grocery network of 13 import, storage and consolidation centers and a grocery distribution network that has 47 grocery distribution centers (DCs).\nHe said there is inbound freight from suppliers that go into the Walmart distribution centers and then Walmart trucks send that outbound freight to Walmart\u2019s stores and clubs \u2013 and now to customer homes in some cases. Cooper also oversees a reverse network of reusable pallets, recalls and defective products.\nHe said the upstream business consists of consolidation volume from smaller suppliers which is about 80% of the intakes. He said fresh and repack volumes amount to about 14% of the freight and imports are 6% of the volume. Upstream volume has grown from 228 million pallets in 2019 to 235 million in 2020. He said returns and mailbacks are up with more groceries being purchased online in the past two years. Defective and recalled items have decreased 20% from 2019.\nAll the extra freight meant Walmart delivered 104 million more pallets. If all the pallets were lined up end to end they would circle the earth 6.5 times, Cooper said.\nHe said it was daunting to see empty shelves in Walmart stores nationwide in March 2020 and subsequent months. Cooper said Walmart has done a better job this year keeping shelves stocked despite a period of record buying. He said winter storms in Texas rendered 16 DCs closed for several days and that was unprecedented for the center of the country where Walmart has a huge store presence.\n\u201cWe also pulled through 5 tropical storms and hurricanes late last year and one grocery DC in Louisiana is still struggling to get back online,\u201d Cooper said.\nAlso in 2020, Walmart\u2019s supply chain division saw a massive decline in workforce numbers despite hiring events, added incentives and wage increases.\n\u201cFor four straight months last year, we had more exits than hires which equated to net negatives in just about all of our facilities. It was a dire situation for several months, but another round of wage increases and two national hiring events helped the DCs get staffed back up,\u201d Cooper added.\nCooper said Walmart added 2,600 net hires so far in 2021 bringing the grocery supply workforce up to 36,400. He said the employees work in 36.3 million square feet of DC space. Walmart grocery is on track in 2021 to ship 4.99 billion cases, up from 4.39 billion in 2018 and 4.64 billion in 2019. Last year, Walmart shipped 4.87 billion cases which equals the output of an additional DC in two years. Cooper said the retailer only added one DC, an indication that each DC was running more efficiently. The highest week of output in 2020 was 106.8 million cases that occurred in March of that year as the country began to shut down.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that record would ever be broken, but the week before Thanksgiving this year it was topped with 108.5 million cases shipped to stores,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe difference was that in 2020 we were scrambling, running with smaller crews, somewhat exhausted. This year our changes in operations, more automation and better staffing we could have shipped more, except the store operators told us they had nowhere to put more product. This is a great place to be when you run a supply chain,\u201d Cooper said.\nAlso in the busiest week of 2021, Cooper said Walmart made 117,000 discreet truck deliveries to U.S. stores with a 98.7% on-time performance.\u00a0Cooper said Walmart will continue to add automation to its legacy fulfillment and distribution centers. He said micro-fulfillment centers are also a way Walmart is getting consumable inventory closer to the consumers.\nHe said the automation going into DCs and fulfillment operations remove some redundant tasks. He said average warehouse workers would walk an average of 10 miles a day, stooping and bending for 10 hours and lifting a total of roughly 50,000 pounds throughout their shifts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s hard to keep people in these roles. But automating those tasks we can use the employee in more important ways running these machines and adding more efficiency to the operations. An automated facility can do almost double the output of a traditional legacy facility,\u201d Cooper said.\nHe said the path to the consumer is also becoming more complex. Cooper said there is a wider assortment of products than ever before and there are some distinct logistics requirements depending on the item. He said grocery and cold chain foods will most likely continue to be purchased in stores and via online grocery pickup and delivery via last-mile partners.\nBut shelf-stable foods have more possibilities with direct shipping to homes from the fulfillment centers, automated replenishment, store delivery for in-store shoppers, curbside pickups and final-mile deliveries with various partners like DoorDash and Walmart\u2019s Spark drivers. Cooper said the supply chain for grocery continues to evolve as the message from consumers is clear.\n\u201cThey want what they want when they want it and where they want it and it\u2019s up to Walmart to respond to their demands. We have learned so much in the past 18 months and we continue to invest for the future with automation, building a strong workforce and continue to manage the costs of our end-to-end supply chain which is best-in-class,\u201d Cooper said.\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon took part this week with the Biden administration\u2019s meeting on supply chain. McMillon said Walmart is seeing a 51% increase in throughput at the congested San Pedro Bay ports in the past month after shifting to 24/7 shipping. Walmart has moved cargo 26% faster nationally \u201cin terms of getting containers through ports\u201d over the last four weeks, McMillon said.\n\u201cWe have more inventory than we did a year ago and have the inventory that we need to be able to support the business. And we are seeing progress. The port and transit delays are improving,\u201d McMillon said.\nRelated\nRead the Digital Issue\nSubscribe Now\nFollow NWABJ on Facebook\nSearch Talk Business & Politics\n Talk Business & Politics by email\nArkansas headlines delivered to you on demand\nFollow TBP Everywhere\n\n\n\nTalk Business & Politics is a news website that covers business, politics and culture in Arkansas.

He said fresh and repack volumes amount to about 14% of the freight and imports are 6% of the volume. Upstream volume has grown from 228 million pallets in 2019 to 235 million in 2020. He said returns and mailbacks are up with more groceries being purchased online in the past two years. Defective and recalled items have decreased 20% from 2019.\nAll the extra freight meant Walmart delivered 104 million more pallets. If all the pallets were lined up end to end they would circle the earth 6.5 times, Cooper said.\nHe said it was daunting to see empty shelves in Walmart stores nationwide in March 2020 and subsequent months. Cooper said Walmart has done a better job this year keeping shelves stocked despite a period of record buying. He said winter storms in Texas rendered 16 DCs closed for several days and that was unprecedented for the center of the country where Walmart has a huge store presence.\n\u201cWe also pulled through 5 tropical storms and hurricanes late last year and one grocery DC in Louisiana is still struggling to get back online,\u201d Cooper said.\nAlso in 2020, Walmart\u2019s supply chain division saw a massive decline in workforce numbers despite hiring events, added incentives and wage increases.\n\u201cFor four straight months last year, we had more exits than hires which equated to net negatives in just about all of our facilities. It was a dire situation for several months, but another round of wage increases and two national hiring events helped the DCs get staffed back up,\u201d Cooper added.\nCooper said Walmart added 2,600 net hires so far in 2021 bringing the grocery supply workforce up to 36,400. He said the employees work in 36.3 million square feet of DC space. Walmart grocery is on track in 2021 to ship 4.99 billion cases, up from 4.39 billion in 2018 and 4.64 billion in 2019. Last year, Walmart shipped 4.87 billion cases which equals the output of an additional DC in two years. Cooper said the retailer only added one DC, an indication that each DC was running more efficiently. The highest week of output in 2020 was 106.8 million cases that occurred in March of that year as the country began to shut down.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that record would ever be broken, but the week before Thanksgiving this year it was topped with 108.5 million cases shipped to stores,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe difference was that in 2020 we were scrambling, running with smaller crews, somewhat exhausted. This year our changes in operations, more automation and better staffing we could have shipped more, except the store operators told us they had nowhere to put more product. This is a great place to be when you run a supply chain,\u201d Cooper said.\nAlso in the busiest week of 2021, Cooper said Walmart made 117,000 discreet truck deliveries to U.S. stores with a 98.7% on-time performance.\u00a0Cooper said Walmart will continue to add automation to its legacy fulfillment and distribution centers. He said micro-fulfillment centers are also a way Walmart is getting consumable inventory closer to the consumers.\nHe said the automation going into DCs and fulfillment operations remove some redundant tasks. He said average warehouse workers would walk an average of 10 miles a day, stooping and bending for 10 hours and lifting a total of roughly 50,000 pounds throughout their shifts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s hard to keep people in these roles. But automating those tasks we can use the employee in more important ways running these machines and adding more efficiency to the operations. An automated facility can do almost double the output of a traditional legacy facility,\u201d Cooper said.\nHe said the path to the consumer is also becoming more complex. Cooper said there is a wider assortment of products than ever before and there are some distinct logistics requirements depending on the item. He said grocery and cold chain foods will most likely continue to be purchased in stores and via online grocery pickup and delivery via last-mile partners.\nBut shelf-stable foods have more possibilities with direct shipping to homes from the fulfillment centers, automated replenishment, store delivery for in-store shoppers, curbside pickups and final-mile deliveries with various partners like DoorDash and Walmart\u2019s Spark drivers. Cooper said the supply chain for grocery continues to evolve as the message from consumers is clear.\n\u201cThey want what they want when they want it and where they want it and it\u2019s up to Walmart to respond to their demands. We have learned so much in the past 18 months and we continue to invest for the future with automation, building a strong workforce and continue to manage the costs of our end-to-end supply chain which is best-in-class,\u201d Cooper said.\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon took part this week with the Biden administration\u2019s meeting on supply chain. McMillon said Walmart is seeing a 51% increase in throughput at the congested San Pedro Bay ports in the past month after shifting to 24/7 shipping. Walmart has moved cargo 26% faster nationally \u201cin terms of getting containers through ports\u201d over the last four weeks, McMillon said.\n\u201cWe have more inventory than we did a year ago and have the inventory that we need to be able to support the business. And we are seeing progress. The port and transit delays are improving,\u201d McMillon said.\nRelated\nRead the Digital Issue\nSubscribe Now\nFollow NWABJ on Facebook\nSearch Talk Business & Politics\n Talk Business & Politics by email\nArkansas headlines delivered to you on demand\nFollow TBP Everywhere\n\n\n\nTalk Business & Politics is a news website that covers business, politics and culture in Arkansas.

    "Summarized_Document": "Tim Cooper, Walmart's senior vice president of supply chain and grocery and reverse logistics, discussed the challenges and lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic at the WalStreet Speaker Series. Walmart's end-to-end grocery supply chain includes 13 import, storage, and consolidation centers and 47 grocery distribution centers (DCs). The company has seen significant changes in its operations since 2020, including an increase in upstream volume from 228 million pallets in 2019 to 235 million in 2020. Despite challenges like winter storms and workforce shortages, Walmart managed to keep shelves stocked and improve efficiency. In 2021, Walmart added 2,600 net hires, bringing the grocery supply workforce to 36,400 employees working in 36.3 million square feet of DC space. The company shipped 4.99 billion cases in 2021, up from 4.87 billion in 2020. Automation has played a key role in increasing efficiency, with automated facilities nearly doubling the output of traditional ones. Walmart's supply chain continues to evolve to meet consumer demands, with a focus on automation, workforce development, and cost management. CEO Doug McMillon noted improvements in port and transit delays, with a 51% increase in throughput at the San Pedro Bay ports and a 26% faster national cargo movement over the last four weeks.",

Additionally, the bulletin also includes highlights regarding the boreal summer (June-July-August). Most of the reported findings are based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature highlights:\u00a0\n  \n\nGlobal Temperatures\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally (together with August 2023), with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August.\u202f\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was 1.51\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level and is the 13th month in a 14-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. *\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record for any 12-month period, at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. These values are identical to those recorded for the previous two 12-month periods, ending in June and July 2024.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.23\u00b0C warmer than the same period in 2023. The average anomaly for the remaining months of this year would need to drop by at least 0.30\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. This has never happened in the entire ERA5 dataset, making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record.\u00a0\n*Datasets other than ERA5 may not confirm the 13 months above 1.5\u00b0C highlighted here, due to the relatively small margins above 1.5\u00b0C of ERA5 global temperatures for July and August 2023 and May, June, and August 2024 and differences among the various datasets.\u00a0\nEurope and other regions\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for August 2024 was 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August, making the month the second warmest August on record for Europe after August 2022, which was 1.73\u00b0C above average.\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean temperatures were most above average over southern and eastern Europe, but below average over northwestern parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway.\u00a0\u00a0\nOutside Europe, temperatures were most above average over eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\nTemperatures were below average over far eastern Russia and Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan and the Sahel.\u00a0\nSea surface temperature\u00a0\nThe average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest value on record for the month, and only 0.07\u00b0C below August 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe equatorial Pacific had below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs across the oceans remained unusually high over many regions.\u00a0\nAccording to Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): \"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0\nMonthly year-to-date global surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for the ten warmest years on record. 2024 is shown with a red line, 2023 with a yellow line, and all other years with grey lines.

The year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, the highest on record for this period.In Europe, August 2024 was the second warmest on record, with temperatures 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Southern and eastern Europe experienced the highest anomalies, while northwestern parts of Ireland, the UK, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway were below average. Globally, temperatures were most above average in eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia, and below average in far eastern Russia, Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan, and the Sahel.The average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest on record for the month. The equatorial Pacific showed below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs remained unusually high in many regions.Hydrologically, August 2024 was drier than average over most of continental Europe, including southern UK and Ireland, the Alps, the Balkans, northwest Russia, and eastern Fennoscandia, with droughts and wildfires in the south and east. Conversely, Iceland, northern UK and Ireland, much of Fennoscandia, the northern seaboard of continental Europe, and western Russia and T\u00fcrkiye experienced above-average precipitation, leading to floods and damage in some areas. Outside Europe, eastern North America, central Russia, eastern China, and eastern Australia were wetter than average, while Mexico, southern North America, regions of Russia, China, most of South America, and Southern Africa were drier than average, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia, and Brazil.The global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C). The average temperature for European land for summer 2024 was the highest on record at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Summer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe, while most of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe experienced drier-than-average conditions, sometimes associated with drought.The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides detailed monthly climate bulletins based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations worldwide. The service is part of the EU's Copernicus Earth observation programme, which aims to provide reliable and up-to-date information about the planet and its environment.",

Additionally, the bulletin also includes highlights regarding the boreal summer (June-July-August). Most of the reported findings are based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature highlights:\u00a0\n  \n\nGlobal Temperatures\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally (together with August 2023), with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August.\u202f\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was 1.51\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level and is the 13th month in a 14-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. *\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record for any 12-month period, at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. These values are identical to those recorded for the previous two 12-month periods, ending in June and July 2024.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.23\u00b0C warmer than the same period in 2023. The average anomaly for the remaining months of this year would need to drop by at least 0.30\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. This has never happened in the entire ERA5 dataset, making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record.\u00a0\n*Datasets other than ERA5 may not confirm the 13 months above 1.5\u00b0C highlighted here, due to the relatively small margins above 1.5\u00b0C of ERA5 global temperatures for July and August 2023 and May, June, and August 2024 and differences among the various datasets.\u00a0\nEurope and other regions\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for August 2024 was 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August, making the month the second warmest August on record for Europe after August 2022, which was 1.73\u00b0C above average.\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean temperatures were most above average over southern and eastern Europe, but below average over northwestern parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway.\u00a0\u00a0\nOutside Europe, temperatures were most above average over eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\nTemperatures were below average over far eastern Russia and Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan and the Sahel.\u00a0\nSea surface temperature\u00a0\nThe average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest value on record for the month, and only 0.07\u00b0C below August 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe equatorial Pacific had below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs across the oceans remained unusually high over many regions.\u00a0\nAccording to Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): \"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0\nMonthly year-to-date global surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for the ten warmest years on record. 2024 is shown with a red line, 2023 with a yellow line, and all other years with grey lines.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission, reports that August 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally, with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. This month was 1.51\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, marking the 13th month in a 14-month period where global temperatures exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. The year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, the highest on record for this period.In Europe, August 2024 was the second warmest on record, with temperatures 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Southern and eastern Europe experienced the highest anomalies, while northwestern parts of Ireland, the UK, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway were below average. Globally, temperatures were most above average in eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia, and below average in far eastern Russia, Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan, and the Sahel.The average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest on record for the month. The equatorial Pacific showed below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs remained unusually high in many regions.Hydrologically, August 2024 was drier than average over most of continental Europe, including southern UK and Ireland, the Alps, the Balkans, northwest Russia, and eastern Fennoscandia, with droughts and wildfires in the south and east. Conversely, Iceland, northern UK and Ireland, much of Fennoscandia, the northern seaboard of continental Europe, and western Russia and T\u00fcrkiye experienced above-average precipitation, leading to floods and damage in some areas. Outside Europe, eastern North America, central Russia, eastern China, and eastern Australia were wetter than average, while Mexico, southern North America, regions of Russia, China, most of South America, and Southern Africa were drier than average, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia, and Brazil.The global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C). The average temperature for European land for summer 2024 was the highest on record at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Summer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe, while most of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe experienced drier-than-average conditions, sometimes associated with drought.The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides detailed monthly climate bulletins based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations worldwide.
