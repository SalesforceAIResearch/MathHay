    "THIS REPORT CONTAINS ASSESSMENTS OF COMMODITY AND TRADE ISSUES MADE BY USDA STAFF AND NOT NECESSARILY STATEMENTS OF OFFICIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY Required Report: Required - Public Distribution Date: March 15, 2024 Report Number: SP2024-0003 Report Name: Food Processing Ingredients Annual Country: Spain Post: Madrid Report Category: Food Processing Ingredients Prepared By: Arantxa Medina Approved By: Karisha Kuypers Report Highlights: In 2023, Spain imported $2.2 billion worth of agricultural, seafood and forest products from the United States, up 3 percent compared to the previous year. Even though inflation rates declined in 2023 as compared to the record highs registered in 2022, they remained higher compared to pre-pandemic levels. The high energy cost of raw materials and labor, as well as the effects of the drought, have increased the inflationary situation with repercussions for the productivity of companies and their margins, as well as for household consumption. Despite the economic and political uncertainties, Spain\u2019s food and beverage sector continues to show a constant and positive performance. With one of the most competitive food processing industries in Europe, Spain\u2019s demand for ingredients continues to increase, as well as its demand for distilled spirits, beef and beef products, seafood, pulses, and tree nuts. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 2 Market Fact Sheet: Spain Spain is a major producer and exporter of food and agricultural products, with other EU countries as its primary export destination. Spanish producers, processors, wholesalers, retailers, food service operators, and importers are all part of a well-developed agribusiness sector, contributing to a competitive and dynamic domestic scenario. In 2023, Spain\u2019s total imports of agricultural and related products reached $65.4 billion, up 2.4 percent compared to 2022; 57 percent of these imports originated from the European Union. Goods imported into Spain must meet the EU sanitary and phytosanitary requirements to protect human and animal health, as well as requirements under the customs union. Hence, U.S. exporters already exporting to other EU member states will likely meet most of the Spanish import requirements. For the export of animal products, the production plant must be approved for export to the EU. Total Imports of Consumer-Oriented Products 2023 In 2023, the food-processing sector consolidated its position as an important industrial sector. Spain enjoys a modern food-processing sector that pays special attention to the quality, safety, and traceability of the food products it produces. It has one of the most competitive food processing industries in Europe, which makes this sector an important target for U.S. exports of food ingredients. Industry\u2019s interest in developing new products continues to present opportunities for food ingredients. The retail competitive landscape remained highly fragmented in 2023, led by major grocery retailers. Within grocery store-based retailing, the competitive environment is concentrated, with Mercadona retaining its leadership, followed by Carrefour. In 2024, due to new consumption habits, internet retailing is expected to continue growing, as retailers continue to invest in eCommerce platforms.

MARKET SUMMARY Under the current complex macroeconomic environment, the Spanish food and beverage industry has carried out its activity under the pressure of rising production costs and the consequent effects on business results. Even though inflation rates declined in 2023 as compared to the record highs registered in 2022, they remained higher compared to pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, in nominal terms, industry's production grew extraordinarily to above 17 percent, but once the price factor is applied this figure is reduced to 1.5 percent. This indicates the strong impact that inflation has had on business margins, in addition to the brake imposed on production, which had managed to maintain a constant line in the previous crises. However, despite the economic and political uncertainties, Spain\u2019s food and beverage sector has continued its positive performance. In 2022, the food and beverage industry continued to be the strongest industrial sector in Spain. Its gross added value, estimated at close to $30 billion, represented 19.3 percent of the manufacturing industry and close to 2.5 percent of the total Spanish economy. 2023 has once again proven to be a very demanding year for small and medium companies. The food and beverage industry maintained its business network above 30,159 companies, demonstrating during this year some increase in the number of medium and large companies. This trajectory shows an improvement in the size of the industry, although small and medium companies continue to represent the majority of the sector, representing more than 96 percent of the sector. Table 1. Advantages and Challenges Facing U.S. Food Processing Ingredients Advantages Challenges Spanish consumers are increasingly open to new products. The United States is a favorite destination for Spanish travelers outside the EU, increasing the popularity and interest in U.S. food products. Adjustments to the overall domestic and international economy situation (inflation, international conflicts, drought, logistics challenges). Spain\u2019s food industry relies on imported ingredients, many from the United States, which have a good image and reputation. Food imported from third countries, including the U.S., must comply with EU food law, labeling, traceability, and packaging laws, which vary from U.S. regulation and practice. Increased demand in retail channels is pushing food processors to be more innovative to provide new offerings. High transportation costs. In addition, small exporters face difficulties in shipping mixed/smaller container loads vs EU competitors or big exporters. Good network of agents and importers to help get products into the market. Competition from EU countries, where tastes and traditional products may be better known. New generation of consumers demand healthy, innovative, sustainable products, creating new opportunities. Lack of consumer awareness of U.S. brands, applicability, and varieties of U.S. products. Distribution structure is modern and many companies cover both Spain and Portugal. High import tariffs and import regulations impose a price disadvantage on non-EU based companies. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 4 SECTION II. ROAD MAP FOR MARKET ENTRY Entry Strategy Success in introducing products in the Spanish market requires local representation and personal contact. A local representative can provide up-to-date market intelligence, guidance on business practices and trade related laws, sales contact with existing and potential buyers, and market development expertise. The Office of Agricultural Affairs in Madrid maintains listings of potential importers and develops sector-specific information to help introduce your product in Spain. Customs are involved in the implementation and enforcement of European legislation relating to external trade, not only for customs duties and commercial policy measures, but also as regards security, environmental, anti-dumping, consumer protection, cultural and agricultural controls. Goods imported into the EU must meet the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements to protect human and animal health and as part of the custom union. Though Spain implements harmonized EU rules and regulations, there are subtleties that exporters should learn about when considering exporting to Spain. For more information, we invite potential U.S. exporters to contact our office for additional sector-specific information. U.S. exporters already exporting to other member states will likely meet most of the requirements for exporting to Spain. Typically, operators buy food ingredients from importers or wholesalers. Some large companies buy directly from foreign suppliers. Other companies concentrate on the domestic or on export markets, but most will have mixed customers. Companies supplying the domestic market frequently sell their products directly and have their own logistics infrastructure. However, their customers will vary from wholesalers to buying groups and retailers. Companies producing for re-export may have their own marketing office overseas, local agents, or may work with local importers. U.S. exporters also face challenges with EU labeling and traceability regulations. Labeling is required for any product that contains genetically modified ingredients. For details, visit the EU labeling requirements section of the USEU Mission webpage. Import Procedures The local importer has primary responsibility with the Spanish Government for imported food products once they enter Spain. It is recommended that that U.S. exporters verify all import requirements with their Spanish buyer. The buyer and local freight forwarder are in the best position to research such matters and assist with local authorities. The final authorization to import any product is subject to the Spanish rules and regulations as interpreted by border officials at the time of product entry. Spain follows the Harmonized Nomenclature and Classification System (HS) and applies EU import duties according to a maximum and minimum rate schedule. If your product is or contains plant or animal products, it will require a phytosanitary or health certificate issued by the competent U.S. authority. In addition, if you are exporting animal products, your production plant must be approved to export into the EU. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 5 The following documents are required for ocean or air cargo shipments of food products into Spain: \uf0b7 Bill of Lading and/or Airway Bill \uf0b7 Commercial Invoice \uf0b7 Phytosanitary Certificate and/or Health Certificate, when applicable \uf0b7 Import Certificate For all details, please check the Food and Agricultural Import Regulations and Standards Report (FAIRS) and the FAIRS Export Certificate Report for the EU and Spain, and the U.S. Mission to the European Union (USEU Mission) website for helpful information on exporting U.S. food and agricultural products into the EU. Please keep in mind that if the product you are exporting into Spain does not comply with EU harmonized regulations, Spanish customs or health authorities may not allow entry of the product. Trade Shows Trade shows in Spain continue to offer excellent opportunities for U.S. exporters to contact potential clients or business partners from Spain, Portugal, other EU countries and other continents. The most important trade shows are: Alimentaria, in Barcelona March 18-21, 2024, and the USDA-endorsed show Seafood Expo Global, in Barcelona April 23-25, 2024.

This report (in English) contains useful and up to date information on Spain\u2019s economy, reforms to increase competitiveness, employment trends, and foreign investment, among other topics to understand the Spanish business climate. Many U.S. companies are present in Spain, either through joint ventures, acquisitions, etc. Some examples of U.S. companies in the Spanish food and beverage industry are (in alphabetical order): Bunge Iberica - fats and oils; Cargill - fats, oils, additives, pet food; Coca Cola Espa\u00f1a - beverages, snacks; H.J. Heinz Foods Spain - prepared vegetables; Mondelez International - cheese, snacks; Kellogg\u2019s Espa\u00f1a - breakfast cereal; Pepsico Espa\u00f1a - beverages, juices, snacks. Major Consumer Trends: \uf0b7 Price sensitivity: 75 percent of Spanish consumers look for a bargain before making a final purchasing decision, while a quarter leave their regular retailer if they find lower prices elsewhere. Price sensitivity also results in a lack of loyalty to brands. \uf0b7 Environmental shift and pressure: increasing awareness of environmental challenges are having a powerful impact on consumer behavior and purchasing decision making. \uf0b7 Population changes: trends such as urbanization, migration, and aging are reshaping consumer lifestyles and shopping decisions. Single/two person households are growing and households of four or more persons are declining. The low birth rate and the increasing percentage of elderly people is another trend that will require adjustments in market supply. SECTION III. COMPETITION Spain\u2019s main trading partner is the EU-27. The lack of trade tariffs, trade barriers and other restrictions make European goods more attractive and competitive, particularly to price sensitive goods. Product Category (TMT; million USD) Major Supply Sources in 2023 (in value) Strengths of Key Supply Countries Advantages and Disadvantages of Local Suppliers Frozen Fish Imports: 259 Value: $695 1.Portugal-13% 2.Netherlands-8% 3.Morocco\u20136% Other major suppliers offer high quality fish products at competitive prices. Large competition from local producers. Domestic consumption and exports largely exceed local supply. Almonds Imports: 126 Value: $437 1.USA-73% 2.Portugal-11% 3.Australia - 8% Limited competition from other countries. Spanish demand is high, and production is insufficient to satisfy demand. Spain produces almonds, mostly used roasted as a snack. U.S. almonds are processed, both used domestically or exported. Pulses Imports: 792 Value: $421 1. USA - 15% 2. Canada -12% 3. Argentina- 10% Strong competition from Argentina, who greatly increased its presence in recent years, and Canada, a traditional supplier. Spain is a traditional consumer of pulses, and a net importer, as local production is insufficient to fulfill internal demand. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 9 Pistachios Imports: 15 Value: $145 1.USA-72% 2. Iran -11% 3. Germany - 10% Germany is the main entry point for U.S. pistachios. Iranian pistachios are the competitor in the Spanish market and offer lower prices. Local pistachio production is growing, but still very limited. Demand continues to grow significantly. Sunflower Seeds Imports: 301 Value: $339 1.France-52% 2.China-19% 3.Romania-8% Used for confectionery. Growing competition from China on price; Argentina competitor on quality. Traditional snack.

    "ENERGY USE IN U.S. AGRICULTURE: AN OVERVIEW Greta Raser and Madeline Silecchia* INTRODUCTION The agricultural industry in the United States relies on a variety of tools and methods to accommodate the intensive and highly efficient production processes considered necessary to meet current demand. Farms implement energy-intensive practices such as machinery use, transportation, and pesticides and other chemical inputs to efficiently produce large quantities of quality crops or livestock products. In 2012 alone, the U.S. agriculture industry used about 800 trillion British Thermal Units (BTU) of energy.1 The hidden costs of efficient agricultural production include the impacts of the fossil-fuel based energy that is used to produce our everyday foods. Energy use in agriculture is classified as either direct or indirect energy use. Direct energy use is the consumption and use of fuels on the farm. These are very clearly seen on farms at the time of production and include most commonly propane, natural gas, electricity, and distillate fuels (diesel).2 Indirect energy use is the use of fuels to make products that will later be used on farms. This use of energy is much less obvious as a contribution to agricultural energy consumption since it is not directly consumed on the farm. However, because the agricultural process includes any aspect that plays a role in bringing the finished product to market, an accurate assessment of energy use in agriculture will include indirect energy use.3 Energy is consumed in four general phases of agricultural production: agriculture, fertilizer production, transportation, and processing. Agriculture is the growing and harvesting of crops and the care and slaughter of livestock. Transportation is the process of sending agricultural products by any means of transportation to the next step of production. Processing is needed for food that is not able to be consumed directly after leaving the farm. Additionally, processing often requires additional transportation to processing facilities. Lastly, food and other agricultural products go through the handling phase. At this point food and products are packaged, canned and sold into the market.4 * Clean Energy Advocacy Interns, Institute for Energy and the Environment, Vermont Law School, 2020 1 Susan Hicks, U.S. Energy Information Admin., Energy For Growing And Harvesting Crops is a Large Component of Farm Operating Costs, https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=18431. 2 U.S. Energy Information Admin., Glossary, https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=distillate. 3 Susan Hicks, supra note 1. 4 American Food Production Requires More Energy than You'd Think, Save On Energy Blog (Dec. 6, 2019), www.saveonenergy.com/learning-center/post/american-food-production-requires-energy/. 2 The agricultural industry is a complex system with advanced technology and farming practices that consume a large amount of energy.5 For example, 4% of California electricity consumption is used in agriculture and 5% of the state\u2019s natural gas use is attributable to food production.6 The United States uses a staggering amount of fossil fuels to produce foods like vegetables, milk and meat, resulting in the large carbon footprint left by U.S. food production. Extreme energy use exists at all levels of the farming industry from small organic farms to large industrial farms. DIRECT ENERGY While every species of plant and animal has its own needs, it may require more uses of energy, such as needing extra care or more fertilizers. Direct energy use is the most obvious use of energy in agriculture. Direct energy is the development and consumption of energy within the inner workings of an entity and its activities, structures, as well as upkeep.7 Direct energy use can be from any type of renewable or non-renewable energy. However, the majority of energy used on U.S. farms is non-renewable energy such as diesel, electricity liquefied petroleum, natural gas and gasoline.8 The amount of energy used directly on farms is evident in the large amounts of money spent on energy use in both crop and livestock industries. The average expenditures of agriculture can be analyzed to begin understanding how much these industries are investing in their energy consumption. First, 2012 data reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicates that crop farms consume more energy than livestock farms in every energy source category.9 5 Agriculture and Energy Consumption, https://foodprint.org/issues/agriculture-energy-consumption/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-1293 (last visited July 26, 2020). 6 California Energy Commission, Energy in Agriculture Program (2017), http://www.energy.ca.gov/process/agriculture/; see also Emma G. Fitzsimmons, Tap Water Ban for Toledo Residents, The New York Times (August 3, 2014), https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/us/toledo-faces-second-day-of-water-ban.html?_r=0. 7 Direct and Indirect Energy Consumption by Source, FenRIAM 1 (July 18, 2020), www.fenriam.eu/direct-and-indirect-energy-consumption-by-source.html. 8 Id. 9 Susan Hicks, supra note 1. 3 Second, the expenditures on agricultural energy use are informative. For context, the total U.S. expenditure on fuel in 2017 was $12,000,000. This number consists of both indirect and direct energy sources.10 Fuel is 3.3% of the agriculture's total overall expenditures.11 Crops use an average $8,511 per farm on fuel and livestock spend an average of 3,906 per farm. Crop farms are going to be using more tractors, self-propelled, and farm machinery than livestock farms therefore it makes sense for them to be spending more on these objects as well. Crops on average spend $9,139 on tractors/self-propelled farm machinery and $4,227 on other farm machinery. Livestock farms spend more money on trucks and automobiles than crops at an average of $2,696 per farm.12 The amount spent on trucks, tractors, and machinery indicates how much energy within each category. Today there are multiple practices used to care and grow crops which require equipment of various fuels. There is a long list of uses on a farm that derives the use of some type of fuel or energy source.13 In almost every action on a farm you can drive energy. Crop farms derive more energy overall than livestock farms do. On a crop farm the energy use that occurs in the beginning of production occurs in the form of field work using some type of large operating equipment such as mowers, tractors, plow and combines. Different types of equipment are needed to manage the soil like weeding, harvesting, tillage, fertilizing and seed distribution. Farmers tend to use either equipment hooked to their tractors to perform these tasks or purchase additional machinery that is capable of performing these tasks individually. Whichever method is used in the field, diesel and gasoline are the fuels that are needed to power these highly important 10 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 2015 Energy Balance for the Corn-Ethanol Industry 8 (2016). 11 Nat\u2019l Agric. Statistics Serv., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric, 2017 Census of Agriculture (2019). 12 Id. 13 Jodi Ziesemer, Energy Use in Organic Food Systems (2007), http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/233069/energy-use-oa.pdf. 4 and large tools. However, these are under traditional crop farming standards that do not include electricity for lights and heat from greenhouses or propane powered fire weeding and many more methods that farmers use to accommodate their unique crop. For example, orchids use heaters to prevent frost. Livestock farming is uniquely different compared to crop farming. Livestock farms use mostly direct energy to care for its animals. Since most of the operations occur inside, farms put more energy into powering the building with lights, heat and ventilation just to make the building safe for workers and animals. When dealing with animals in an industrial farm there is use of many moving parts such as water distribution, waste management and feeding machines. Although these methods are efficient for time and cleanliness, they derive these benefits from the use of large amounts of distillate fuel. Oil is needed to improve flow of the farm through the use of internal conveyors and elevators. These machines move the animals and the product to necessary parts of the farm. The use of the livestock does not alter the need for large refrigeration. Refrigeration derives electricity twenty-four hours a day without being shut off in order to conserve products until they leave the farm. Almost every aspect of livestock production requires some form of direct energy fuel.14 INDIRECT ENERGY While direct energy in agriculture focuses on the activities on the farm, thus making them \u201cdirect,\u201d indirect energy can include the activities that happen during pre-production and post-production that take place off the farm. Most of the research about indirect energy use in agriculture focuses on fertilizer and pesticides because the production of these two substances accounts for a large portion of the indirect energy. As the population has increased, farmers have used increasing amounts of fertilizers to increase agriculture production. Fertilizer has helped grow the production output of certain crops, including wheat, soybeans, corn, rice, and oats to name a few.15 About 70-80% of the energy used to produce fertilizers comes from natural gas, due in part to the high volume of nitrogen fertilizer production.16 Natural gas is used to create a nitrogen fertilizer called anhydrous ammonia and natural gas is important for the ammonia synthesis done by the Haber-Bosch process, which is commonly used in nitrogen fertilizer production.17 The Haber-Bosch process became a growing phenomenon after World War II because it made it possible to mass produce fertilizers, therefore contributing along with pesticides and herbicides to the 14 Susan Hicks, supra note 1. 15 The Fertilizer Institute, Improving Lives (2020), www.tfi.org/our-industry/intro-to-fertilizer/improving-lives. 16 Clark Gellings et al., Energy Efficiency in Fertilizer Production and Use (2009). 17 Id. 5 increase in yields that came about.18 While this Haber-Bosch process consumes only about 3-5% of the world\u2019s natural gas, scientists are working to make it more efficient to help reduce global energy demand.19 There are also different fertilizer types. Nitrogen fertilizer is used more than the other two, potash and phosphate.20 While nitrogen is extracted from air, potash and phosphates are retrieved through mining processes.21 Phosphate fertilizer production consumes about 5,600 BTUs per pound of phosphate, while potash fertilizer production consumes about 4,700 BTUs per pound of potash.22 Nitrogen fertilizer production utilizes greater than 75% of all the energy use attributable to total fertilizer production with a consumption of about 25,000 BTUs per pound of nitrogen. Therefore, not only is nitrogen fertilizer used more frequently, but it is also more energy intensive to produce than the other two.23 Indirect energy use also includes chemical inputs like pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides, which farmers also rely on to increase yields.24 Although pesticide use consumes less energy than fertilizer use, it is still a significant contributing factor, with more than $9 billion spent on pesticides by U.S. producers in 2012 to protect their yields from potential harm by pests.25 While less than 15% of energy use in agriculture is ascribed to pesticides, it requires more energy per pound to manufacture pesticides than nitrogen fertilizer.26 Pesticide production typically uses petroleum sources, as well as some electricity, natural gas, and steam for certain steps of the manufacturing process.27 However, the amount of energy for the production of different pesticides may depend on the method used to manufacture them and the chemical composition.28 Fertilizer and pesticide use varies by agriculture and crop type, with about 1.25 billion pounds of pesticides used each year, most overall used by feed and food grain crops and most 18 Vaclav Smil, Nitrogen Cycle and World Food Production, http://vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/smil-article-worldagriculture.pdf. 19 Improving Ammonia Synthesis Could Have Major Implications for Agriculture and Energy, ScienceDaily (2010), https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101117094031.htm. 20 Econ.

Crop agriculture uses more energy and has a higher percentage of energy expenditures than livestock agriculture.31 The variations in fertilizer and pesticide use can then be broken down even more, when examining organic crop agriculture, which does not make use of energy-intensive fertilizers and pesticides like industrial crop agriculture does.32 In addition to the production of fertilizers and pesticides, their post-production aspects also contribute to the total indirect energy use in agriculture. This can include processing, distributing, and transportation.33 The Fertilizer Institute describes the steps of the fertilizer supply chain as first the collection of raw materials, which are the three types previously discussed: nitrogen, phosphate, potash, then the manufacturing at a production facility, followed by storage and distribution to a retailer who may create nutrient blends specific to their needs, and then to the farm.34 These post-production aspects of energy use for fertilizers and pesticides are difficult to measure because they vary based on numerous factors, including type of transportation and distance travelled as well as type of packaging and processing methods.35 For fertilizers, about 4,000 BTUs per ton are required to move a mile by truck and about 1,600 BTUs per ton for a mile by rail.36 For pesticides, oil-based ones are estimated to use about 430 BTUs per pound for transportation.37 Fertilizers and pesticides are mostly used in \u201cconventional agriculture\u201d as opposed to organic agriculture which relies on less inputs.38 Much of what is considered \u201cinefficient\u201d in conventional agriculture is due to the amount of energy consumed during the manufacturing of fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the energy consumed while transporting and distributing them.39 Conventional farming depends more on energy-intensive fertilizers, pesticides, and concentrated feed, another aspect of indirect energy, than organic farms do.40 There are ways however, that farmers can utilize fertilizers and pesticides more efficiently to save energy. Soil testing is one option for farmers to assess which soil patches have a lack of nutrients and therefore have more need for fertilizer.41 This saves energy by not utilizing extra fertilizers on 29 Id. 30 Susan Hicks, supra note 1. 31 Id. 32 Jodi Ziesemer, supra note 13. 33 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 17. 34 The Fertilizer Institute, supra note 7. 35 Energy-Efficient Use of Fertilizer and Other Nutrients in Agriculture, supra note 22. 36 Id. 37 Energy Use and Efficiency in Pest Control,, supra note 26. 38 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 10. 39 Id. 40 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 4. 41 Energy Use and Efficiency in Pest Control,, supra note 26. 7 areas where it is not necessary and instead applying those fertilizers to soils with a lack of nutrients.42 Placement of fertilizer close to the seed during planting is another more effective method, as well as liming soil to the crop\u2019s optimal pH, crop rotation, and timing the application of fertilizer based on what research has shown to produce the most effective results can also help with energy reduction.43 For pesticides, one main method to reduce energy is to utilize integrated pest management through carefully searching for pests and determining when it is economically best to spray preventative pesticides instead of spraying them constantly.44 Animal feed manufacturing is another category of indirect energy use. Concentrated feed can be produced off-farm, making them indirect consumers of energy, however determining if they fall under indirect or direct energy use can depend on if they are produced on the farm or not, which they usually are for organic farms and are usually not for conventional farms.45 Production of feed for livestock tends to be intensive and makes use of chemicals and fertilizers, adding to the inefficiency of energy use.46 Similar to fertilizers and pesticides, much of the energy used for livestock feed is due to production, processing, and transportation, amounting to about 2/3rds specifically for conventional livestock feed.47 Post-production activities such as processing and packaging can have various definitions on if they are direct or indirect energy consumers. For the purposes of this project, if they are performed on-site at the farm they are considered direct and if they are performed off-site they are indirect. Packaging can be a large consumer of energy, with one evaluation by Heller et al. finding that packaging had exceeded the total combined amount of energy used in production, processing, and transportation.48 However, packaging is important because it prevents food spoilage, which would be an inefficient use of energy, and there are ways to utilize more recycled and biodegradable materials for packaging, as seen on some organic farms.49 Storage is another component that depending on locational factors could be considered direct or indirect energy consumption. Refrigeration, pest and fungal control contribute to energy consumption for storage for both conventional and organic farms, and synthetic preservatives and other chemicals may also contribute to energy use for conventional agriculture.50 Distribution and transportation are typically the next steps after storage, and as touched on previously depend on the type of transportation, fuel, loading efficiency, distance, and consumer 42 Id. 43 Id. 44 Energy Use and Efficiency in Pest Control, supra note 26. 45 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 14. 46 Id. 47 Id. 48 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 16. 49 Id. 50 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 17. 8 travel.51 However, low energy use in one aspect of post-production may offset some energy expenditures for transportation and there are different methods that can cut energy use, such as delivery or pick up to a nearby center can cut costs of transportation by about 37-43% as well as supplying a local wholesaler.52 There was a finding however, that while locally sourced food may decrease energy use in some cases, other times it may not due to the use of smaller vehicles and lower loads.53 Nevertheless, finding local food can be an important step to reducing an individual\u2019s energy footprint because it is common for food nowadays to be imported internationally.54 Even within the United States, agriculture is concentrated in certain areas and large percentages of certain crops are grown in specific regions, largely due to industrial farming.55 Organic agriculture will sometimes put an emphasis on buying locally to reduce individual energy use, which is an important thing to do, but does not take away from the large-scale changes that are needed by the energy and agriculture industries to reduce their ecological footprints. While measuring indirect energy use, it\u2019s important to consider those energy consumers that aren\u2019t always obvious. As mentioned above, there can be many layers to indirect energy use. The production of fertilizers and pesticides is a large portion of indirect energy consumption, but the transportation and handling of these substances is another layer, as well as the transportation and handling of the crops on which these fertilizers and pesticides are used. Some other indirect energy uses that might be considered are food intake by workers56, as well as energy used in manufacturing equipment, even though that\u2019s done only once, and the energy wasted from food waste. CONCLUSION Throughout history, as the population has grown there has been an increasing demand for industrial farming and the ability to feed a large number of people. Certain developments of fertilizers and pesticides that help increase agricultural outputs may help yield efficiency, but in order to use these in the large amounts that they\u2019re used in, they do consume significant amounts of energy. While there are many direct and indirect energy factors at play when it comes to overall energy consumption in agriculture, it\u2019s important to find renewable energy options and sustainable alternatives for all factors. Finding renewable options not only may benefit the natural environment, but it may help with environmental justice concerning humans who deal 51 Id. 52 Id. 53 Id. 54 Eating Sustainably: An Introduction to Sustainable Food (2011), https://sustainability.emory.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Sustainable_Food_Information_Booklet.pdf. 55 Id. 56 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 20. 9 with water and air contamination from chemicals, fossil fuels, and other harmful toxins from the energy and agriculture industries. Organic agriculture was mentioned earlier as having lower energy inputs, which can be a sustainable alternative to more conventional and industrial farms.57 While this system tends to require less energy and has less greenhouse gas emissions, it is not a perfect system that can still have large energy uses in certain areas, such as large travel distances, even international. Buying local food was one option of a change that consumers can make in their lives. One source gives a few other important lifestyle changes to be aware of, such as being aware of the energy required to produce the food that makes up your diet because meats and animal products tend to require a lot of energy.58 Other steps for consumers they describe are meal planning to decrease food waste and energy efficient storage to decrease energy consumption by refrigerators.59 While working to reduce energy consumption at the consumer level can be important, it is not always accessible for everyone due to different life situations. This makes it even more important that the energy and agriculture industries work to reduce their large amounts of fossil fuel usages. Some farms have already implemented renewable energy sources on-site like wind, solar and biomass technologies, as well as implemented methods to rotate crops to fix nitrogen in soil to make use of less fossil fuels.60 Many farms may have the potential to include renewable resources, and different policies may have the ability to incentivize these practices which is hopefully a shift that we will see in the near future. 57 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 4. 58 Save on Energy Team, American Food Production Requires More Energy Than You Think (2019), https://www.saveonenergy.com/learning-center/post/american-food-production-requires-energy/. 59 Id. 60 Agriculture and Energy Consumption (2020), https://foodprint.org/issues/agriculture-energy-consumption/."
