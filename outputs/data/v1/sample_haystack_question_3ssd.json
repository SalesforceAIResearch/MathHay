Plus, it\u2019s estimated that roughly 40% of all web traffic is hosted by those two companies combined. But which looks like the better buy today, AMZN stock or GOOG stock?\nBoth stocks were beaten down by the growth stock sell-off of 2022. GOOG has suffered less damage from all the selling, down 6% since the start of 2022 vs. AMZN\u2019s 13% loss. Going back a bit further, to just after the March 2020 Covid crash, the performance of both stocks has been far more palatable, with GOOG up 126% in since March 13, 2020, vs. a 63% gain for AMZN. Over the last five years, GOOG is up 156% vs. an 83% gain in AMZN.\nThose are strong returns for GOOG, especially when compared to the 64% return in the S&P 500 in the last five years. Amazon though? Not so much. Now the question is: Can AMZN and GOOG repeat or beat that performance over the next five years?\n[text_ad]\nIt would be foolish to doubt either company at this point. That said, no stock continues to grow at a breakneck pace forever. Just ask anyone who bought General Electric (GE) 10 or 15 years ago, when it ranked among the 10 largest companies in the world by market cap. So chances are, one or both of these blue-chip tech stocks will start to slow in the years ahead.\nGiven that backdrop, I thought it might be a fun exercise to examine which tech giant stock is better positioned for future growth.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at AMZN stock and GOOG stock, broken into a few key numbers:\nTrailing P/Es: AMZN 76, GOOG 26\nForward P/Es: AMZN 42, GOOG 20\nEstimated 2023 revenue growth: AMZN 11%, GOOG 8.2%\nEstimated 2023 EPS growth: AMZN 1,089%, GOOG 51.4%\nCash per share: AMZN $6.21, GOOG $9.58\nInstitutional ownership: AMZN 61%, GOOG 62%\nThat comparison tells us that AMZN is still the more overvalued stock. However, until recently it had been the faster-growing company on both the top and bottom lines; and it had been since 2016. That was also the year Amazon first turned consistently profitable.\nThat said, Google has way more cash than Amazon - nearly double in terms of total cash, with roughly a fifth as much debt. Considering that Amazon brings in nearly twice as much revenue as Google annually (though that gap is closing), that means that Amazon has been way more willing to spend its cash on things that will grow the company - the Amazon Prime Video streaming service that is rivaling Netflix these days; a new foray into live sports with NFL broadcasts; the Amazon Echo, Amazon Web Services, etc. Google looks more like a cash hoarder. The result is that Amazon stock has grown much faster than GOOG stock in the last decade, though that has certainly changed in the last two years.\nThe guess here is that Google will start loosening its purse strings in the coming years, devoting it to new, exciting products like the long-anticipated and recently released Google Pixel Watch intended to rival the Apple Watch, a new Pixel smartphone, or perhaps Google will join Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Disney in the big-money streaming video wars (YouTube did make a splash buying the NFL broadcast rights). Regardless of what it comes up with, bet on Google spending more of its $120 billion cash stockpile soon. If it does, that could capture investors\u2019 attention the way Amazon did up until the last few years.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either of these growth stocks. If you bought both of them five, 10 or even 15 years ago, you\u2019ve made a LOT of money. But AMZN has been the better performer, at least up until recently. I think that might change in the years to come. Between its cash stockpile, untapped potential revenue streams, and cheaper valuation, I like GOOG stock to outperform AMZN in the next five years. In fact, that shift already seems to be taking place, as the last few years have shown. It could be the start of a longer-term role reversal between two of the biggest, baddest tech stocks on the block.\nFurthermore, after such extreme selling last year, both these stocks are still trading below their 2021 levels despite a furious run-up to start this year. You could buy both (or either, although I prefer GOOG); either way, an investment in GOOG stock will likely turn out quite well five years from now.\nFor a list of the stocks that actually have momentum after a tough earnings season, consider taking a trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Trader.

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

    "Document": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives:\nBuild microtargeting capabilities\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\nQuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nRather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments\u00a0at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases.\nInvest in wellness\nA rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging).\nPropel the social\u2013digital experience\nCompanies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries)\u00a0become more important.\nWe see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers.\nOffer premium products where they matter\nOffering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures.\nIn this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.\nThe authors wish to thank Cait Pearson, Heather Gouinlock, and Keir Sullivan for their contributions to this article.\nThis article was edited by Alexandra Mondalek, an editor in the New York office.",

Despite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age. In emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets said they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe and 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk. 3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers. This intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers. What will consumers want? What consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies. 4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups. In advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts. Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior. This weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers. One beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality. 5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims outpaced sales of products without such claims. While young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023. Younger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims. 6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually. In advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets. In emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States. It\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so. Weight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years. By 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective. 7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually by 2040. A higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well. Where will consumers shop? Knowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world. 8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend. Just because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas. Emerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world. 9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind. Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States. Attempts to grow the social-commerce market in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months. Four imperatives to win the consumer of the future In light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives: Build microtargeting capabilities About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Rather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases. Invest in wellness A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging). Propel the social\u2013digital experience Companies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries) become more important. We see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers. Offer premium products where they matter Offering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures. In this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

The index includes Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, MBS (agency fixed-rate pass-throughs), ABS and CMBS (agency and non-agency).\nThe S&P 500 Equal Weighted Index is the equal-weight version of the widely-used S&P 500.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

series whenever new monthly data are added; the inclusion of the most recent LFS data in the calculation process; update of seasonal adjustment models with complete annual data.\nCompared with the rates published in News Release of 3 April 2024, the February 2024 unemployment rate for the EU has been revised from 6.0% to 6.1%, while the unemployment rate for the euro area remained unchanged. Among EU Member States, the rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) upwards for Spain (by 0.3 pp) as well as for Finland and Sweden (by 0.2 pp each). The rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) downwards for Greece (by 0.2 pp).\nCountry notes\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden as well as Iceland and Norway: the trend component is used instead of the more volatile seasonally adjusted data.\nEstonia and Portugal: 3-month moving averages of LFS data are used instead of pure monthly indicators.\nMethods and definitions\nEurostat publishes harmonised unemployment rates for individual EU Member States, the euro area and the EU. These unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The measurement is based on a harmonised data source, the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS).\nBased on the ILO definition, Eurostat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:\nare without work;\nare available to start work within the next two weeks;\nand have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks.\nThe unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.\nThe labour force is the total number of people employed plus unemployed. In this news release unemployment rates are based on employment and unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74.\nThe youth unemployment rate is the number of people aged 15 to 24 unemployed as a percentage of the labour force of the same age. Therefore, the youth unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the share of jobless people in the overall youth population.\nWhen data for the most recent month are not available for a Member State, EU and EA aggregates are calculated using the latest data available for that Member State.\nGeographical information\nEuro area (EA20): Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.\nEuropean Union (EU27): Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden.\nFor more information\nEurostat website section on employment and unemployment\nEurostat database section on unemployment, including non-seasonally adjusted and trend data\nStatistics Explained articles on unemployment\nEurostat metadata on adjusted unemployment series\nEuro indicators dashboard\nRelease calendar for Euro indicators\nEuropean Statistics Code of Practice\nGet in touch\nMedia requests\n\n\n\n\nEurostat Media Support\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 33 408\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: eurostat-mediasupport@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nFurther information on data\n\n\n\n\nThibaut HENRION\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 31 686\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevena CHOLAKOVA\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 35 304\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: estat-monthly-unemployment@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nShare the release\n\nWas this page useful?                \nIf you do not wish to provide more detailed feedback, please just click on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button to send your response. \n\nNeed help?                    \n\nFollow us                    \n\nContact the EU                    \n\nSocial media                    \n\nLegal                    \n\nEU institutions                    \n\n                        EU institutions\n                    \n",
    "Summarized_Document": "In March 2024, the euro area seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 6.5%, stable compared to February 2024 and down from 6.6% in March 2023. The EU unemployment rate was 6.0% in March 2024, down from 6.1% in February 2024 and stable compared to March 2023. Eurostat estimates that 13.258 million persons in the EU, including 11.087 million in the euro area, were unemployed in March 2024. Compared to February 2024, unemployment decreased by 74 thousand in the EU and by 94 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, unemployment increased by 175 thousand in the EU and decreased by 51 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, 2.858 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU, including 2.259 million in the euro area. The youth unemployment rate was 14.6% in the EU, down from 14.7% in February 2024, and 14.1% in the euro area, down from 14.4% in the previous month. Compared to February 2024, youth unemployment decreased by 11 thousand in the EU and by 30 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, youth unemployment increased by 150 thousand in the EU and by 36 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, the unemployment rate for women was 6.4% in the EU, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 5.7%, down from 5.8% in the previous month. In the euro area, the unemployment rate for women was 7.0%, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 6.0%, down from 6.1% in the previous month.\n\nThe estimates are based on the International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard definition of unemployment, which includes people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks. Additional indicators such as underemployed part-time workers and persons seeking work but not immediately available are also considered.\n\nThe document includes detailed tables showing seasonally adjusted unemployment rates and the number of unemployed persons in thousands for the euro area, EU, and individual countries from March 2023 to March 2024. For example, in March 2024, Germany had an unemployment rate of 3.2% with 1,421 thousand unemployed persons, while Spain had an unemployment rate of 11.7% with 2,854 thousand unemployed persons.\n\nYouth unemployment rates and numbers are also detailed, with the euro area having a youth unemployment rate of 14.1% in March 2024, down from 14.4% in February 2024, and the EU having a rate of 14.6%, down from 14.7% in February 2024.

All rights reserved. Key takeaways \u2022 China\u2019s GDP grew 5% year-over-year (YoY) in H1 2024, reaching the target set at the Two Sessions earlier this year. In Q2 2024, the economy grew 4.7%, down from 5.3% in Q1 and lower than market expectations. Extreme weather, adjustments to calculations of the value of the financial industry, and sluggish domestic demand weighed on economic growth. \u2022 The momentum of consumption slowed down with a decline in income growth. The growth of retail sales fell to 2.6% in Q2 2024 from 4.7% in Q1. At its July meeting, the Politburo pointed out that consumption would be the core engine to boost domestic demand. Consumption is expected to recover moderately in H2 2024. \u2022 Manufacturing investments held up relatively well, with a growth rate of 9.3% in Q2 2024. The expansion of equipment renewals is expected to sustain robust growth in manufacturing investment. \u2022 Growth in infrastructure investment dropped slightly to 7.2% in Q2 2024 from 8.8% in Q1. Government investment slowed down due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. With issuances of local government special bonds and extra long-term special treasury bonds speeding up, however, infrastructure investment is expected to remain robust.\n\u2022 The property market is still struggling with weak sales and sluggish investment. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2 2024. To further raise housing demand and promote activity in the property market, policies to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory will be implemented in H2 2024.\n\u2022 Thanks to continuous improvement in external demand, exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with robust growth of 5.8% YoY in Q2. China\u2019s trade with emerging markets has seen fast growth, reflecting strengthened regional collaborations. Meanwhile, the optimisation of the structure of export commodities continues. Exports are expected to remain resilient through 2024. \u2022 Overall, driven by the implementation of equipment renewal policies and the recovery of external demand, China\u2019s GDP growth remained relatively stable in H1 2024. However, it is worth noting that domestic demand is still insufficient. The downturn in prices has had a direct effect on incomes, corporate profits and fiscal revenues, constraining spending. In addition, growing foreign trade tensions may weigh on China\u2019s exports. The government is expected to adopt a more accommodative macro policy stance in H2 2024 to facilitate the recovery of economic growth. 3 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

However, the growth rate in Q2 dropped to 4.7% in Q2 from 5.3% in Q1, which was lower than expectations. Beyond challenges posed by extreme weather, the slowdown reflected sluggish domestic demand.\n\u2022 The contribution of consumption to GDP fell from 73.7% in Q1 to 46.5% in Q2. Retail sales growth plummeted to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1 due to weakness in incomes. Fixed asset investment growth dropped to 3.6% in Q2, with activity in the real estate market remaining subdued and infrastructure investment constrained by shortages in fiscal funds.\n\u2022 Export growth picked up from 1.5% in Q1 to 5.8% in Q2 due to a lower base and robust external demand. 2020-23 Average 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 GDP 4.8% 6.3% 4.9% 5.2% 5.3% 4.7% Industrial production 5.0% 4.5% 4.2% 5.2% 6.1% 5.9% Retail sales 4.1% 10.7% 4.2% 8.3% 4.7% 2.6% Fixed asset investment 4.4% 3.1% 1.9% 2.7% 4.5% 3.6% Exports 9.0% -4.9% -9.9% -1.2% 1.5% 5.8% Imports 6.4% -7.0% -8.5% 0.9% 1.6% 2.5% Income per capita 4.8% 8.3% 6.1% 6.7% 6.2% 4.2% Fiscal revenue 4.6% 31.7% -0.9% -1.0% -2.3% -3.2% Fiscal expenditures 3.7% 1.0% 4.1% 9.2% 2.9% 1.1% 4 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Extreme weather and weak demand still weighed on production side Manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI Source: Wind, KPMG analysis \u2022 The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 for the past three months, since April, and fell to 49.4 in July. The divergence between production and demand recovery persisted. The production index dropped 0.5 to 50.1 while the new orders index fell to 49.3 in July, declining below the 50 point mark. A reading under 50 indicates a contraction.\n\u2022 The non-manufacturing sector also slowed down. Affected by extreme weather, construction activity slowed in July and the Construction PMI dropped 1.1 points to 51.2. With capital markets and the real estate industry still sluggish, the services PMI index dropped to 50, reaching its lowest level for the year.\n20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Manufacturing Construction and Services 5 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Consumption slowed as residents\u2019 income growth declined Growth of retail sales by category, YoY, % \u2022 Consumption has continued a pattern of differentiated recovery since 2023, with services sales increasing 7.5% YoY in H1 2024, 4.3 percentage points higher than goods sales growth. Robust sales of non-discretionary consumer goods and higher-quality goods contributed to consumption. Retail sales of property-related goods improved to varying degrees, driven mainly by relaxed real estate policies and effective trade-in policies of consumer goods.\n\u2022 The government has identified boosting domestic demand through consumption as a key focus in H2 2024. It sees service consumption as an important lever to expand and upgrade consumption, supporting sectors including culture and tourism, elderly care, housekeeping, childcare, etc.\nSource: Wind, KPMG analysis.

But it remained below the average of 71.0% for the same period of 2014-2019, indicating room for improvement. \u2022 The slowdown in consumption growth was primarily due to slower income growth, as the per capita disposable income increased by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. This was 0.8 and 1.1 percentage points lower than in Q1 2024 and H1 2023, respectively. \u2022 Strengthening measures to stabilize employment and raise income will be necessary to support a steady recovery in residents' consumption ability and willingness.\nSource: Wind, KPMG analysis Note: Residents\u2019 propensity to consume = nationwide per capita consumption expenditures / nationwide per capita disposable income 55 60 65 70 75 80 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2014-2019 Average 2020-2023 Average 2024 7 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Weak fiscal revenues constrained government expenditures in Q2 2024 Growth rate of general fiscal revenues and expenses, YoY, % \u2022 General fiscal revenue growth dropped to -7.2% YoY in Q2, down from -2.6% in Q1 and -2.8% in H1 2024. Specifically, tax revenue declined by 5.6% and land transfer income dropped by 18.3% in H1. \u2022 With shrinking revenues, the government curbed the expansion of investment, causing the growth rate of general fiscal expenses to fall to -4.1% YoY in Q2, down from -1.5% in Q1. It was well below the 7.9% budgeted growth rate set at the beginning of the year. \u2022 Looking ahead, in addition to accelerating the issuance of local government special bonds in H2 2024, the central government is expected to raise its debt ceiling in 2024 in order to achieve its fiscal budget targets.

More likely was that the limited improvement in sales prompted enterprises to stay cautious about expanding investment.

Both sales revenue and domestic loan growth performed better in Q2 than in Q1.\n\u2022 While liquidity pressure on property developers eased slightly, overall property funding in H1 remained at historic lows.

Inflation is expected to pick up moderately China Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), YoY, % \u2022 CPI rose by 0.2% YoY in June 2024, down from 0.3% in May. It was mainly due to the seasonal decline in food prices and the narrowed growth in energy prices. \u2022 Supported by a lower base, the YoY decline in PPI narrowed in June, raising from -1.4% in May to 0.8% in June. However, the PPI continued its month-on-month slide of 0.2%, reflecting the ongoing imbalance between supply and demand facing industrial sectors.\n\u2022 Looking ahead, CPI and PPI are expected to pick up modestly in H2 2024, buoyed by rebounding demands and the effects of new policies.

New bank loans in Q2 2024 totalled RMB 3.3 trillion, down RMB 5.8 trillion from Q1 2024, indicating weak credit demand from the real economy amid a slowing momentum of China\u2019s economic recovery in Q2.\n\u2022 As the government accelerated bond issuances in Q2, net financing from government bond issuances rose to RMB 2.0 trillion in Q2, a YoY increase of RMB 431.5 billion.\n\u2022 Low market interest rates boosted corporate willingness to issue bonds.

This gradual decline in financing costs aimed to convey an accommodative policy signal to markets.\n\u2022 Further cuts are expected for reserve requirement ratios and other policy rates as financial conditions ease globally.

    "Summarized_Document": "China\u2019s GDP grew 5% year-over-year (YoY) in H1 2024, meeting the target set at the Two Sessions. However, the growth rate in Q2 2024 dropped to 4.7% from 5.3% in Q1, falling short of market expectations due to extreme weather, adjustments in financial industry valuations, and sluggish domestic demand. Retail sales growth fell to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1, reflecting a slowdown in income growth. Manufacturing investments grew by 9.3% in Q2, supported by equipment renewals, while infrastructure investment growth dropped to 7.2% from 8.8% in Q1 due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2, with policies expected to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory in H2 2024. Exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with a robust 5.8% growth in Q2, driven by strong external demand and regional collaborations. Despite stable GDP growth in H1 2024, domestic demand remains insufficient, and foreign trade tensions may impact exports. The government is expected to adopt more accommodative macro policies in H2 2024 to support economic recovery. The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 since April, indicating contraction, while the non-manufacturing sector also slowed due to extreme weather. Consumption growth slowed as residents' income growth declined, with the per capita disposable income increasing by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. Manufacturing investment growth was driven by exports and equipment renewals, despite a slight drop to 9.3% in Q2 from 9.9% in Q1. Infrastructure investment growth fell to 7.2% in Q2 from 8.8% in Q1, constrained by extreme weather and fiscal funding shortages. General fiscal revenue growth dropped to -7.2% YoY in Q2, leading to a reduction in government expenditures. Property sales showed limited improvement, with investment growth dropping to -10.5% in Q2. Liquidity pressure on property developers persisted, with funding sources growth picking up slightly to -22.6% in H1 2024. CPI rose by 0.2% YoY in June 2024, while PPI decline narrowed, indicating moderate inflation expectations. Growth of total social financing slowed, with new bank loans decreasing by RMB 3.1 trillion in H1 2024. The central bank cut key interest rates to signal accommodative policies. Exports to major trading partners grew, with ASEAN remaining the largest trading partner. The export commodity structure continued to optimize, with mechanical and electrical products leading growth. FDI into China decreased by 29.1% YoY in H1 2024, while ODI grew by 19.5%. The RMB exchange rate remained stable despite global monetary policy divergence. Hong Kong\u2019s GDP grew by 3.3% in Q2 2024, with tourism and private consumption expected to pick up in H2 2024.",

In Q2 2024, the economy grew 4.7%, down from 5.3% in Q1 and lower than market expectations. Extreme weather, adjustments to calculations of the value of the financial industry, and sluggish domestic demand weighed on economic growth. \u2022 The momentum of consumption slowed down with a decline in income growth. The growth of retail sales fell to 2.6% in Q2 2024 from 4.7% in Q1. At its July meeting, the Politburo pointed out that consumption would be the core engine to boost domestic demand. Consumption is expected to recover moderately in H2 2024. \u2022 Manufacturing investments held up relatively well, with a growth rate of 9.3% in Q2 2024. The expansion of equipment renewals is expected to sustain robust growth in manufacturing investment. \u2022 Growth in infrastructure investment dropped slightly to 7.2% in Q2 2024 from 8.8% in Q1. Government investment slowed down due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. With issuances of local government special bonds and extra long-term special treasury bonds speeding up, however, infrastructure investment is expected to remain robust.\n\u2022 The property market is still struggling with weak sales and sluggish investment. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2 2024. To further raise housing demand and promote activity in the property market, policies to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory will be implemented in H2 2024.\n\u2022 Thanks to continuous improvement in external demand, exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with robust growth of 5.8% YoY in Q2. China\u2019s trade with emerging markets has seen fast growth, reflecting strengthened regional collaborations. Meanwhile, the optimisation of the structure of export commodities continues. Exports are expected to remain resilient through 2024. \u2022 Overall, driven by the implementation of equipment renewal policies and the recovery of external demand, China\u2019s GDP growth remained relatively stable in H1 2024. However, it is worth noting that domestic demand is still insufficient. The downturn in prices has had a direct effect on incomes, corporate profits and fiscal revenues, constraining spending. In addition, growing foreign trade tensions may weigh on China\u2019s exports. The government is expected to adopt a more accommodative macro policy stance in H2 2024 to facilitate the recovery of economic growth. 3 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

However, the growth rate in Q2 dropped to 4.7% in Q2 from 5.3% in Q1, which was lower than expectations. Beyond challenges posed by extreme weather, the slowdown reflected sluggish domestic demand.\n\u2022 The contribution of consumption to GDP fell from 73.7% in Q1 to 46.5% in Q2. Retail sales growth plummeted to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1 due to weakness in incomes. Fixed asset investment growth dropped to 3.6% in Q2, with activity in the real estate market remaining subdued and infrastructure investment constrained by shortages in fiscal funds.\n\u2022 Export growth picked up from 1.5% in Q1 to 5.8% in Q2 due to a lower base and robust external demand. 2020-23 Average 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 GDP 4.8% 6.3% 4.9% 5.2% 5.3% 4.7% Industrial production 5.0% 4.5% 4.2% 5.2% 6.1% 5.9% Retail sales 4.1% 10.7% 4.2% 8.3% 4.7% 2.6% Fixed asset investment 4.4% 3.1% 1.9% 2.7% 4.5% 3.6% Exports 9.0% -4.9% -9.9% -1.2% 1.5% 5.8% Imports 6.4% -7.0% -8.5% 0.9% 1.6% 2.5% Income per capita 4.8% 8.3% 6.1% 6.7% 6.2% 4.2% Fiscal revenue 4.6% 31.7% -0.9% -1.0% -2.3% -3.2% Fiscal expenditures 3.7% 1.0% 4.1% 9.2% 2.9% 1.1% 4 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

However, the growth rate in Q2 2024 dropped to 4.7% from 5.3% in Q1, falling short of market expectations due to extreme weather, adjustments in financial industry valuations, and sluggish domestic demand. Retail sales growth fell to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1, reflecting a slowdown in income growth. Manufacturing investments grew by 9.3% in Q2, supported by equipment renewals, while infrastructure investment growth dropped to 7.2% from 8.8% in Q1 due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2, with policies expected to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory in H2 2024. Exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with a robust 5.8% growth in Q2, driven by strong external demand and regional collaborations. Despite stable GDP growth in H1 2024, domestic demand remains insufficient, and foreign trade tensions may impact exports. The government is expected to adopt more accommodative macro policies in H2 2024 to support economic recovery. The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 since April, indicating contraction, while the non-manufacturing sector also slowed due to extreme weather. Consumption growth slowed as residents' income growth declined, with the per capita disposable income increasing by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. Manufacturing investment growth was driven by exports and equipment renewals, despite a slight drop to 9.3% in Q2 from 9.9% in Q1. Infrastructure investment growth fell to 7.2% in Q2 from 8.8% in Q1, constrained by extreme weather and fiscal funding shortages. General fiscal revenue growth dropped to -7.2% YoY in Q2, leading to a reduction in government expenditures. Property sales showed limited improvement, with investment growth dropping to -10.5% in Q2. Liquidity pressure on property developers persisted, with funding sources growth picking up slightly to -22.6% in H1 2024. CPI rose by 0.2% YoY in June 2024, while PPI decline narrowed, indicating moderate inflation expectations. Growth of total social financing slowed, with new bank loans decreasing by RMB 3.1 trillion in H1 2024. The central bank cut key interest rates to signal accommodative policies. Exports to major trading partners grew, with ASEAN remaining the largest trading partner. The export commodity structure continued to optimize, with mechanical and electrical products leading growth. FDI into China decreased by 29.1% YoY in H1 2024, while ODI grew by 19.5%. The RMB exchange rate remained stable despite global monetary policy divergence. Hong Kong\u2019s GDP grew by 3.3% in Q2 2024, with tourism and private consumption expected to pick up in H2 2024.",

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6). The percentage of deaths coded as influenza during Week 11 was 0.0% compared to 0.1% during Week 10 (Figure 7).\n4 24 1 24 104 1 25 166 28 34 520 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Deaths ICU Non-ICU Percentage of Influenza Hospitalizations Severity of Hospitalization <18 years 18-49 years 50-64 years \u226565 years 9 of 20 Figure 6.

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). Methods used to identify pediatric influenza-coded deaths on death certificates differ from those used to identify the influenza-associated pediatric deaths presented below, which require laboratory confirmation of influenza, and might not include the same individuals. One laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated death in a child <18 years of age was reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received nine reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths among children <18 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season. Influenza-associated Outbreaks Two laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks were reported during Week 11. To date, 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported to CDPH during the 2023\u20132024 season. One previously reported outbreak was removed because it did not meet the outbreak definition. Figure 9.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10.

Figure 12. Percentage of RSV Detections at Clinical Sentinel Laboratories, 2018\u20132024 Season to Date RSV Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cRSV,\u201d \u201csyncytial,\u201d \u201cbronchiolitis,\u201d and variants of the keywords are defined as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related admissions. The number of RSV admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same period to estimate the percentage of RSV admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. The percentage of admissions for RSV in Kaiser Permanente facilities in northern California during Week 11 was 0.3% compared to 0.3% during Week 10 (Figure 13). 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 40 Oct 42 44 Nov 46 48 Dec 50 52 2 Jan 4 6 Feb 8 10 Mar 12 14 Apr 16 18 May 20 22 Jun 24 26 28 Jul 30 32 Aug 34 36 Sep 38 Percentage of Specimens Tested Positive for RSV Week 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-2022 2022-2023 2023-2024 Note: Data have been shifted so that Week 1 aligns across seasons. 15 of 20 Figure 13. Percentage of RSV Admissions in Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2018\u2013 2024 Season to Date To date, 802 non-intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations, 123 ICU admissions, and 20 deaths have occurred among persons with RSV admission diagnoses. Most RSV admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 14). Please note that RSV admissions serve as a proxy for RSV activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed RSV infections. Figure 14.

RSV-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are likely to be an underestimate of all RSV-associated deaths. During Week 11, ten RSV-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 295 RSV-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 15). The percentage of deaths coded as RSV during Week 11 was 0.11% compared to 0.19% during Week 10 (Figure 16). Figure 15.

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). No laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated deaths in children <5 years of age were reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received three reports of laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated deaths among children <5 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season.

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6).

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). Methods used to identify pediatric influenza-coded deaths on death certificates differ from those used to identify the influenza-associated pediatric deaths presented below, which require laboratory confirmation of influenza, and might not include the same individuals. One laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated death in a child <18 years of age was reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received nine reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths among children <18 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season. Influenza-associated Outbreaks Two laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks were reported during Week 11. To date, 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported to CDPH during the 2023\u20132024 season. One previously reported outbreak was removed because it did not meet the outbreak definition. Figure 9.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10.

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

    "Summarized_Document": "Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJonathan H. Pelletier, Jaskaran Rakkar, Alicia K. Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

The rising demand for antidepressant drugs affects market prices as well. Patients may find antidepressants to be more affordable because many of them are available in generic form.\u00a0\nWhich Region is Expanding at the Fastest CAGR?\nAsia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth in the antidepressant drugs market during the forecast period. Changes in the financial system, societal norms, and lifestyle might increase the likelihood of mental health issues like depression, which in turn drives up the need for antidepressant drugs. The aging population raises the possibility of mental health issues like depression. This shift in the population might support the growth of the antidepressant industry. The market will grow if government initiatives are implemented to provide access to basic treatment for all mental health conditions. Additionally, the market is growing due to growing sales of CNS stimulants, an increase in the number of persons experiencing stress, and growing awareness about the illness state and necessary treatment needs.\r\n\u00a0\nThe current report Scope analyzes Antidepressant Drugs Market on 5 major region Split (In case you wish to acquire a specific region edition (more granular data) or any country Edition data then please write us on info@cognitivemarketresearch.com\n\nNorth America (United States, Canada, Mexico)\nEurope (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium)\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Rest of APAC)\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Rest of South America)\nMiddle East and Africa (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nigeria, UAE, Egypt, South Africa, GCC Countries, Rest of MEA)\n\n\n\nAntidepressant Drugs Market Share (%) by Region (2019-2031)\n\n\nThe above graph is for illustrative purposes only.

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

The Canadian healthcare system places a high priority on mental health, and a sizable portion of its budget is allocated to services and initiatives in this area.

The rising demand for antidepressant drugs affects market prices as well. Patients may find antidepressants to be more affordable because many of them are available in generic form.\u00a0\nWhich Region is Expanding at the Fastest CAGR?\nAsia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth in the antidepressant drugs market during the forecast period. Changes in the financial system, societal norms, and lifestyle might increase the likelihood of mental health issues like depression, which in turn drives up the need for antidepressant drugs. The aging population raises the possibility of mental health issues like depression. This shift in the population might support the growth of the antidepressant industry. The market will grow if government initiatives are implemented to provide access to basic treatment for all mental health conditions. Additionally, the market is growing due to growing sales of CNS stimulants, an increase in the number of persons experiencing stress, and growing awareness about the illness state and necessary treatment needs.\r\n\u00a0\nThe current report Scope analyzes Antidepressant Drugs Market on 5 major region Split (In case you wish to acquire a specific region edition (more granular data) or any country Edition data then please write us on info@cognitivemarketresearch.com\n\nNorth America (United States, Canada, Mexico)\nEurope (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium)\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Rest of APAC)\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Rest of South America)\nMiddle East and Africa (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nigeria, UAE, Egypt, South Africa, GCC Countries, Rest of MEA)\n\n\n\nAntidepressant Drugs Market Share (%) by Region (2019-2031)\n\n\nThe above graph is for illustrative purposes only.

    "Document": "New COVID vaccines are here. What to know about latest shots in wake of nation\u2019s biggest summer surge\nOn the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers.\nBack in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early.\nManufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use.\nIn considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants.\n\u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d\nWho can get a new COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children:\nAdults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults.\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses.\nI recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine?\nYes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months.\nHowever, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area.\nI just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one?\nFor people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician.\nIf you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated.\nAre the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same?\nBoth use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them.\nComirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nSpikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nAll new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine?\nWhile the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift.\n\u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d\nTaking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2.\nI got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine?\nYes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter.\nIn the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d\nHopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity.\n\u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19.\n\u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d\nCan you get COVID from the vaccine?\nNo. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d\nBecause younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body.\nBen-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d\nCan I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time?\nYes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d\nCan I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated?\nYes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death.\nDoes insurance cover the new COVID vaccine?\nThe vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program.\nThe 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients.\n\u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d\nWhere can I get the new COVID vaccine?\nVisit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829.\nDo I still need a COVID vaccination card?\nIf you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones.\nThe CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.\nFor more on COVID-19 and vaccines:\nSubscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.

Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift. \u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d Taking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2. I got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine? Yes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter. In the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d Hopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity. \u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19. \u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d Can you get COVID from the vaccine? No. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains. \u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d Because younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body. Ben-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d Can I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time? Yes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d Can I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated? Yes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Does insurance cover the new COVID vaccine? The vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program. The 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients. \u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d Where can I get the new COVID vaccine? Visit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829. Do I still need a COVID vaccination card? If you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones. The CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination.

    "Document": "New COVID vaccines are here. What to know about latest shots in wake of nation\u2019s biggest summer surge\nOn the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers.\nBack in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early.\nManufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use.\nIn considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants.\n\u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d\nWho can get a new COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children:\nAdults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults.\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses.\nI recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine?\nYes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months.\nHowever, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area.\nI just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one?\nFor people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician.\nIf you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated.\nAre the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same?\nBoth use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them.\nComirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nSpikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nAll new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine?\nWhile the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift.\n\u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d\nTaking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says.

Back in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early. Manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use. In considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants. \u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d Who can get a new COVID vaccine? The CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children: Adults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults. People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses. I recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine? Yes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months. However, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area. I just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one? For people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician. If you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated. Are the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same? Both use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them. Comirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA. Spikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA. All new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. What\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine? While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift. \u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d Taking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2. I got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine? Yes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter. In the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d Hopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity. \u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19. \u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d Can you get COVID from the vaccine? No. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains. \u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d Because younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body. Ben-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d Can I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time? Yes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d Can I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated? Yes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Does insurance cover the new COVID vaccine? The vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program. The 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients. \u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d Where can I get the new COVID vaccine? Visit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829. Do I still need a COVID vaccination card? If you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones. The CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.

The market provides the value (in USD million) for the above-mentioned segments.\n\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Analysis\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is expected to register a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period (2021 to 2026).\nThe COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on people with hypertension. Also, due to lockdown and other restrictions imposed by governements to curb the spread of the infection from the Covid-19 virus, the lifestyle of patients with hypertension was severely impacted. As per the study titled \"COVID-19 in Patients with Hypertension\" published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology in July 2021, hypertension individuals who have COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality that is at least two times higher; nevertheless, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors that have been offer protection for this subgroup of patients which in turn expected to boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nOne of the leading factors responsible for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market is the rising prevalence of hypertension among people around the world. The major known causes of hypertension are kidney diseases, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and other cardiovascular diseases due to which the prevalence of hypertension has been observed a significant rise over the past few years. Also, some drugs can induce hypertension in patients with other diseases or disorders which in turn is expected to promote the growth of the studied market. As per the updated May 2021 data from the World Health Organization, about 1.13 billion people around the world have hypertension, of which two-third are living in low- and middle-income countries. In the report published in June 2020 titled 'A Global View on Prevalence of Hypertension and Human Development Index' to determine the relationship between the prevalence of hypertension and human development index (HDI) concluded that the prevalence of hypertension ranged from 35% to 41% among 182 countries around the world. Thus, the rising prevalence of hypertension is expected to drive the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nCertain other factors that will boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market include growing initiatives by private and government organizations and rising awareness about hypertension around the around. For instance, in May 2022, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals conclude the hypertension awareness symbol backed by the Association of Physicians of India (API) and Hypertension Society of India (HIS). Additionally, in May 2022, Namya Smile Foundation (NSF) organized an awareness campaign in India related to hypertension among people. The organization conducted a camp and checked the blood pressure and made them aware of various aspects of high blood pressure.\nWhereas factors such as expiration of patent of multiple major drugs along with side effects associated with the hypertension treatment and rise in the availability of other non-pharmacological based therapy will restrict the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market. For Instance, In December 2021, AbbVie, the parent company of Allergan, lost the patent of its anti-hypertensive drug, Bystolic (Nebivolol). Nebivolol is a beta blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Additionally, market participants frequently introduce new products and use a variety of growth tactics in their particular segments, which is likely to spur market expansion. For Instance, in December 2021, Dr Reddy's Laboratories has launched Valsartan tablets, used for treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, in the United States market. The Valsartan tablet is the generic therapeutic equivalent of Diovan, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Similarly, in November 2021, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. reported that Novartis Pharma K.K. (Novartis Pharma) has obtained approval in Japan for ENTREST 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets (generic name: sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate) for the new indication of hypertension. This approval is Japan's first of an ARNI for the indication of hypertension.\nThus, all aforementioned factors expected to boost the market growth over the forecast period, However, multiple major drug patent expiration expected to hamper the market growth.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Trends\n\n This section covers the major market trends shaping the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market according to our research experts: \n\nDiuretics Therapeutics Class is Expected to Hold a Significant Market Share in the Forecast Period\n\nDiuretics help in reducing the sodium and water from the body by inducing kidneys to release more sodium into the urine which leads to lower blood pressure as fluid flowing through the body is decreases. Diuretics are the preferred class of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of hypertension over others mainly because of their high efficacy, low cost, and low side effects as compared to other available therapeutic classes in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nDiuretics are of three types - thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics, from which thiazide diuretics are the cornerstone of treatment for hypertension in most patients around the world. For instance, as per the research article published in July 2022, titled 'Loop Diuretics', Loop diuretics have received FDA approval to be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensives to treat hypertension. However, first-line therapy does not consist solely of loop diuretics. Loop diuretics can be used to address fluid overload conditions and alternative hypertension therapy. Moreover, according to the study titled \"Thiazide diuretics alone or in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic on blood pressure-lowering in patients with primary hypertension: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis\" published in the BMC Open Journal in February 2022, Thiazides have a proven track record of lowering blood pressure, have a good safety record, and are inexpensive. This makes them a popular choice for pharmaceutical treatment. Hydrochlorothiazide has less antihypertensive effectiveness than chlorthalidone and indapamide. Thus,m due to above benefits of the diuretics in the management of hypertension is anticipated to boost the segmrent growth over the forecast period.\nTherefore, owing to the above-mentioned factors, the diuretics therapeutics class is expected to have highest growth as compared to others with the rise in the prevalence of hypertension cases around the world.\n\nNorth America is Expected to Dominate the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market Over the Forecast Period\n\nNorth America holds a major share in the anti-hypertensive drugs market and is expected to show a similar trend over the forecast period mainly due to the high prevalence of hypertension and diseases causing hypertension in the region. Additionally, the demand for prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, identifying people predisposed to the disease, presence of technically advanced healthcare infrastructure, and management of the prognosis of the disease are some of the key market drivers of the North American anti-hypertension market.\nIn North America, the United States will hold the largest market in anti-hypertensive drugs market in the region. In the United States, the rising prevalence of hypertension is the major reason for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drug market. As per the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention In July 2022, over half of adults (47 percent, or 116 million) have hypertension. Thus, the growing burden of hypertension in the United States is expected to rise in the demand anti-hypertensive drug thereby boost the market growth.\nThe other factors such as increasing awareness among the people about hypertension in the region. For instance, in November 2021, New public service announcements (PSAs) were released by the American Heart Association (AHA), American Medical Association (AMA), HHS Office of Minority Health (OMH), Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA), and the Ad Council to encourage people to take charge of their health by self-monitoring their blood pressure and talking with a healthcare provider about their numbers.\nAdditionally, various strategies adopted by the key market players such as product launches and merger and acquisistion supports the market growth. In April 2021, United Therapeutics Corporation announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration approved its drug for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease, known as Tyvaso (Treprostinil).\nThus, the North America is expected to hold major market share in the anti-hypertensive market.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Industry Overview\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is highly competitive due to the presence of a number of pharmaceutical companies. Companies such as AstraZeneca PLC, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, Johnson & Johnson Ltd, Lupin Limited, Merck KGaA ., Novartis AG, among others, hold a substantial market share in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Leaders\n\nPfizer Inc.\nC.H.

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

    "Summarized_Document": "Holding too much inventory ties up capital and increases carrying costs, while not enough stock can lead to slow order fulfillment and lost revenue. The reorder point (ROP) is a technique in supply chain management to balance these issues by determining the minimum number of units needed in stock to meet sales orders or production targets. When inventory falls below this point, a new purchase order is triggered. Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times. An effective reorder point helps fulfill orders quickly, protect margins, and keep customers satisfied.",

Authored by USApple Vice President of Insights and Analytics, Chris Gerlach, the report takes an in-depth look at the trends and forces \u2013 from political headwinds to weather events \u2013 that shape the U.S. apple industry.\n*The Outlook Report is based on recently released United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates. After the presentation of those numbers, USApple members met in-person to discuss current growing conditions to formulate a more up-to-date production estimate. The final USApple 2024/25 crop year forecast is an adjustment of the USDA numbers based on those conversations.\nU.S. Production\nAccording to USApple\u2019s analysis, total U.S. apple production for the 2024/25 crop year (CY) will be 259,517,252 bushels. This represents a 10.1% decrease compared to last year\u2019s final production figure.\n\u201cGrowers from across the U.S. are reporting the crop quality is excellent,\u201d said Gerlach.\nThese figures are more comprehensive than USDA data, which only look at the top seven apple-producing states. USApple analyzes the production from states outside of the top seven and adds that back into USDA\u2019s figure. It also incorporates feedback from growers based on what they\u2019re seeing in the field every day.\n\u201cDespite various challenges, the resilience and dedication of our growers have led to another promising year for apple production,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cThe data we\u2019ve gathered not only highlights the strength of our industry, but also underscores the importance of innovation and adaptability in ensuring a bountiful harvest.\u201d\nVarietal Mix\nAt the varietal level, Gala is expected to retain the top spot with more than 48 million bushels produced, accounting for around 17% of the U.S. apple market. After Gala, rounding out the top five are Red Delicious (12.3%), Granny Smith (10%), Honeycrisp (9.8%) and Fuji (9.4%).\nIn general, the varieties on the rise include Honeycrisp, Pink Lady/Cripps Pink and Cosmic Crisp\u00ae. Fuji, Rome and \u201cother\u201d varieties have remained relatively consistent compared to 2019/20 production volumes. Varieties on the decline include Gala and Red Delicious.\n\u201cWe still see strong Honeycrisp production, but it\u2019s tempered this year,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cWith volumes aligning more closely with Gala and Red Delicious, we may see production levels stabilize rather than increase dramatically in the future.\u201d\nTrade\nAccording to USDA trade data, fresh apple exports totaled 46.4 million bushels in the 2023/24 CY (July to June). This is around 14 million bushels higher than 2022/23 export levels \u2013 an astonishing 44% year-over-year increase.\nDuring the same period, fresh apple imports dropped by around one million bushels, a 15% decline. The joint effects of increasing exports and decreasing imports caused the already net positive fresh apple trade balance to grow to more than 42 million bushels.\nThe surge in fresh apple exports is largely attributed to the abundant domestic supply, competitive pricing abroad, and favorable positive trade policies.\n\u201cThanks to the removal of previously imposed tariffs on our apples, exports to India are up nearly 4,000% year over year. We are optimistic that this critical market will continue to grow in volume and value,\u201d said Gerlach.\nGlobal ProductionAccording to United Nations (UN) data, worldwide apple production surpassed 5 billion bushels for the first time in 2022 (the latest available datapoint). In 2022, China alone was responsible for producing 2.5 billion bushels, around half of the world\u2019s total supply. In 2021, Turkey overtook the U.S. to become the world\u2019s second largest apple producer and maintained that spot in 2022, even widening the gap between us (with 253 million bushels, 5% of world production). The U.S., in the third spot, was credited with 232 million bushels and 4.6% of world production.

    "Document": "2024 Manufacturing Outlook for Sourcing & Supply Chain Resiliency\nKey Takeaways:\nThe Full Article:\nResilience remains a top priority for manufacturers, who continue to increase their operational visibility and transparency and become more agile to proactively address potential supply chain disruptions. To remain competitive in 2024, digital transformation solutions enabling organizations to achieve supply chain resiliency, profitability, and sustainability goals are crucial.\nAccording to KPMG, \u201csmart\u201d supply chain management and sourcing initiatives will make waves powered by advanced technologies such as automation, data analytics, digital twins, and more.\nThis article explores six main priorities that manufacturers are navigating to stay ahead of the competition in 2024:\n1. Increase Supply Chain Speed and Performance with Digitalization\nDigital transformation (DX) can significantly benefit manufacturing sourcing and procurement teams. A growing body of work shows that successful DX initiatives require effective planning and a detailed implementation plan that addresses new technology, employee training, and operational guidelines (workflows) to drive value.\nA 10-year Deloitte study of publicly traded companies worldwide finds that DX tied to an effective strategy and a comprehensive deployment and onboarding process can yield a market capitalization increase of up to 5%. By contrast, DX programs executed without the same level of rigor can cause value erosion.\nHere are two areas of strategic sourcing to consider enhancing:\nI) Streamline Supplier Communications and Revisit Strategic Sourcing Operations\nManufacturers and suppliers want to streamline their sourcing and procurement processes in the current business landscape. A survey conducted by IndustryWeek in collaboration with aPriori found that 70% of respondents want to accelerate the quoting process, and 79% prefer a 24-hour to two-week completion window.\nDigital tools like aPriori provide a centralized solution for real-time supplier collaboration and information exchange. These automated platforms eliminate the need for traditional request for quotation (RFQ) processes that are time-consuming and prone to delays.\nInstead, today\u2019s digital technologies deliver \u201cZero RFQ\u201d or automated procurement capabilities that enable manufacturing companies to:\nII) Accelerate the Product Design and Production Process\nDigital automation-driven solutions help innovators bring together teams spread across different departments. These teams can combine their efforts on a single solution covering design, manufacturing, and sourcing operations.\nWith access to real-time data and visibility into the design and production process, sourcing professionals can get involved early in product development. This helps them identify potential component shortages and recommend design alternatives and changes to an existing bill of materials (BOM). This way, manufacturing companies can avoid supply chain risks and mitigate any negative impacts that may emerge.\naPriori\u2019s real-time co-working application, aP Workspace, expedites task management and provides data audibility for decision-making. Users can access links to the application from their product lifecycle management (PLM) systems to gain actionable insights. These capabilities allow teams to collaborate seamlessly and communicate effectively, achieving their profitability and sustainability goals without reinventing existing business processes.\n2. Build a Solid Foundation for Artificial Intelligence\nManufacturers continue to make digital investments to automate processes, manage data, strengthen internal resources, and facilitate cross-functional collaboration. The result is faster and more informed business decisions for forward-thinking manufacturers.\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most alluring digital tools. S&P\u2019s 2024 Supply Chain Outlook states, \u201cWhile AI cannot prevent supply chain disruptions, if deployed in the correct manner, it could provide predictive probabilities of future disruptions.\u201d\nAI cannot work in a vacuum: It needs robust, accurate data to analyze and address specific manufacturing challenges. But as the MIT Sloan Management Review points out, \u201cManufacturing data is often localized or specific to a particular industry domain or a company\u2019s operations. As a result, there isn\u2019t a lot of relevant data available for building reliable AI models.\u201d\nAdditionally, product design, sourcing, and manufacturing data often reside in individual departments (either in systems that are not integrated or personalized spreadsheets filled with supplier information that is not easily accessible).\nCentralizing and providing access to data across the product development life cycle is central to making data-driven insights (with or without AI). Adding weight, carbon emissions, and other information to a PLM system \u2013 which already stores a bill of materials (BOM) \u2013 makes it easier for product development and sourcing teams to make decisions confidently and anticipate potential issues throughout the development process.\nManufacturers can also use automated analysis solutions like aPriori\u2019s aP Generate, which integrates with the PLM to centralize critical manufacturing information. aP Generate links to aP Design and aP Workspace in the PLM, enabling users to take further steps or ask questions for up-to-date decision-making.\nSome manufacturers are already gaining end-to-end insights using digital twins to connect product design, manufacturing processes, and individual factory capabilities. This data-driven insight is powerful on its own. And it can serve as part of a digital platform that AI can use to make additional analysis quickly.\nPrioritizing data quality is key to unlocking the full potential of AI in the manufacturing industry. With data-driven insights, manufacturers can evaluate alternatives, improve scenario planning operations, transform business models, and enhance supply chain resiliency.\n3. De-Risk Supply Chains and Evaluate Reshoring\nMaintaining a diverse supplier base and reducing overreliance on specific supplier locations mitigates risks associated with geopolitical issues, natural disasters, and other unprecedented events like the 2020 pandemic. Diversified supply chains improve resilience and ensure business continuity in today\u2019s dynamic global environment.\nOne tool that can help manufacturers with this is aPriori\u2019s Regional Data Libraries (RDLs). These digital libraries provide real-world and timely variable material and supplier production costs across 87 global regions. By utilizing this feature, innovators can assess manufacturing alternatives effectively, consider the impact of region-specific tariffs, and avoid an overreliance on specific regions with potential risks. This often leads to significant cost savings and reduced lead times.\nManufacturers can also consider the benefits of reshoring specific manufacturing operations. This can lead to a reduction in shipping costs and taking advantage of valuable tax credits. For instance, automotive manufacturers can use reshoring to redirect the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain to the U.S. This helps eliminate their dependency on semiconductors produced in China and capitalize on a $7,500 tax credit.\nIn its annual Reshoring Index report, the global consulting firm Kearney provides further insight into U.S. reshoring initiatives. Its findings include:\nRead our insights on why reshoring U.S. manufacturing could be right for you.\n4. Offset Labor Shortages via Automation\nAccording to Deloitte\u2019s 2024 Manufacturing Industry Outlook survey, nearly 80% of respondents consider labor market shortages a critical threat. To address this challenge, approximately 50% of manufacturing executives equip their production workforce with advanced digital technologies and flexible schedules. This approach aims to:\nLeading innovators like Woodward leverage aPriori\u2019s automation, simulation capabilities, and actionable insights to counteract the shortage of skilled workers. By employing aPriori, the company can achieve more with fewer resources, such as:\n5. Capitalize on Economic Tailwinds to Accelerate U.S. Manufacturing Growth\nProduct innovators can take advantage of positive economic factors supporting business growth in the upcoming year. These economic trends include:\nI) Federal Investments in Manufacturing Innovation\nThe Biden administration has introduced new measures to strengthen North America\u2019s supply chains and reduce costs. One of the measures implemented is the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act, which aims to reduce America\u2019s reliance on foreign-produced chips.\nThis federal initiative includes $231 billion to build semiconductor factories in the U.S. The program also includes a 25% tax credit for capital investments in semiconductor production to spur innovation and manufacturing in this area.\nAlongside the U.S. CHIPS initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aims to propel clean energy and sustainable manufacturing domestically. The IRA provides more than $1.7 billion in funding and additional tax credits to incentivize manufacturers. This initiative primarily targets consumers, empowering them to purchase green products like EVs.\nCompanies across multiple industries can take advantage of the incentives offered by federal programs. For instance, the building and construction industry can capitalize on these incentives by developing energy-efficient buildings with sustainable insulation, lighting, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Similarly, federal investments to advance the clean energy sector range from EV production in the automotive industry to zero-emissions battery materials.\n6. Use the Green Supply Chain as a Competitive Advantage\nProduct manufacturers increasingly recognize the growing demand from customers and stakeholders for sustainable, green innovations. Manufacturers can achieve a net-zero future by selecting the appropriate raw materials and production processes to decarbonize their product portfolios.\nAcross the globe, several regulations have been implemented to increase sustainable manufacturing and sourcing operations. These measures include:\nThe financial impact of sustainability requires manufacturers to assign a cost to carbon as they design new products and initiate value engineering on older products. Internal Carbon Pricing (ICP) is an approach that manufacturers and other organizations use internally to assign a cost for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted. This enables manufacturing and sourcing teams to understand the cost of carbon and to compare it to traditional manufacturing costs (e.g., material, labor, and manufacturing overhead costs).\nWith an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison, sourcing teams can easily evaluate carbon and other manufacturing costs. Then, they can select the suppliers that will enable them to reach their key performance indicators for cost, CO2e, and other goals.\nGain the Ability to Navigate Global Supply Chain Uncertainty\nThe ongoing process of digital transformation shapes the 2024 manufacturing outlook. This encompasses trends like Generative AI, automation, and digital twin technologies for supply chain resiliency. Advanced digital solutions like aPriori provide real-time advantages, from accelerating product design to counteracting critical labor market shortages.\nIn addition to investing in digital technologies, economic tailwinds, fueled by initiatives like the CHIPS Act, provide sustainable growth opportunities and promote reshoring.\nAt its core, this post highlights the various obstacles, opportunities, and trends that manufacturing companies can expect to face in the upcoming year.\nGet the State of Procurement Report\nSubscribe to the aPriori Blog!\nListen to Our Most Popular Manufacturing Podcasts of 2023\n13 Must-Read Manufacturing Sourcing & Procurement Posts of 2023\nRead Our 7 Best Product Sustainability and Innovation Posts of 2023\nWhat Is Design to Cost?

Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix due to growth of premium products.\nGrooming segment organic sales increased seven percent versus year ago driven by increased pricing primarily in Latin America and volume growth from innovation.\nHealth Care segment organic sales increased four percent versus year ago. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to premium product mix and volume growth in North America and Europe. Personal Health Care organic sales were unchanged as growth due to pricing and volume increases were offset by unfavorable mix due to lower incidence of cough and cold.\nFabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased two percent versus year ago. Fabric Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth driven by North America and Europe was offset by lower pricing due to increased promotional spending. Home Care organic sales increased high single digits due to volume growth from innovation and favorable product mix.\nBaby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales declined one percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines from share losses, partially offset by premium product mix. Feminine Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix. Family Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27 for the quarter, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased by two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS were up six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nReported gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points versus year ago. Core gross margin for the quarter increased 140 basis points versus year ago, 180 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 210 basis points of productivity savings, 100 basis points of lower commodity costs and 40 basis points of pricing benefit. These were partially offset by 130 basis points of unfavorable product mix and 40 basis points of product/package reinvestments and other impacts.\nReported selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 260 basis points versus the prior year. Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points versus year ago and 240 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 300 basis points of marketing reinvestments and 30 basis points of wage inflation and overhead investments, partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of net sales growth leverage and other impacts.\nReported operating margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points due primarily to higher restructuring charges. Excluding 40 basis points of non-core restructuring charges, core operating margin for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus the prior year, 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Core operating margin included gross productivity savings of 250 basis points.\nLimited Market Portfolio Restructuring\nIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company said that it expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nIn the October-December 2023 quarter of the fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nThe impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.\nFiscal Year 2025 Guidance\nP&G expects fiscal year 2025 all-in sales growth in the range of two to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of three to five percent.\nP&G expects fiscal 2025 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 10% to 12% versus fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS of $6.02. P&G expects its fiscal 2025 core net earnings per share growth in the range of five to seven percent versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This outlook equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.98, or an increase of 6%.\nThe Company said its outlook estimates a net headwind of around $500 million after-tax from unfavorable commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The net headwind equates to a $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025, or a three percentage drag on core EPS growth.\nIn addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from minor brand divestitures and tax impacts that are unlikely to repeat to the same extent in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS.\nThe Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nP&G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% in fiscal 2025.\nCapital spending is estimated to be in the range of four to five percent of fiscal 2025 net sales.\nP&G said it expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nThe Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:\nIncremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.\nIntangible asset impairment: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nWe do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.\nOrganic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nCore EPS and Currency-neutral EPS: Core net earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance over time.\nCore gross margin and Currency-neutral Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's Core gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nCore selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of sales and Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales: Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's Core selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.\nCore operating margin and Currency-neutral Core operating margin: Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's Core operating margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nAdjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G\u2019s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nTHE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nAmounts in millions except per share amounts\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\n\u00a0\nIncremental\nRestructuring\n\u00a0\nIntangible\nImpairment\n\u00a0\nCore\n(Non-GAAP)\n\u00a0\nAs Reported\n(GAAP) (1)\nCost of products sold\n$\n10,348\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n(45\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,303\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,613\n\u00a0\nGross profit\n\u00a0\n10,183\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n10,229\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9,940\n\u00a0\nGross margin\n\u00a0\n49.6\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n49.8\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n48.4\n%\nCurrency impact to Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n50.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\u00a0\n6,299\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(28\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6,271\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5,778\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n30.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(0.2\n)%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n28.1\n%\nCurrency impact to Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating income\n\u00a0\n3,884\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n73\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,958\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4,162\n\u00a0\nOperating margin\n\u00a0\n18.9\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.3\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n20.3\n%\nCurrency impact to Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOther non-operating income, net\n\u00a0\n98\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n248\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n346\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n195\n\u00a0\nIncome taxes\n\u00a0\n726\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(6\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n720\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n841\n\u00a0\nNet earnings attributable to P&G\n\u00a0\n3,137\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n327\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,464\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,384\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted net earnings per common share (2)\n$\n1.27\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n0.13\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.40\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.37\n\u00a0\nCurrency impact to Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n1.45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n\u00a0\n2,472.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2,477.5\n\u00a0\nCommon shares outstanding -

    "Summarized_Document": "Procter & Gamble (P&G) reported its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results, highlighting strong performance despite economic and geopolitical challenges. For fiscal year 2024, net sales increased by 2% to $84.0 billion, and organic sales grew by 4%. Diluted EPS rose by 2% to $6.02, while core EPS increased by 12% to $6.59. The company generated $19.8 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $14 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, net sales remained flat at $20.5 billion, with organic sales up by 2%. Diluted EPS for the quarter decreased by 7% to $1.27, while core EPS increased by 2% to $1.40. P&G's fiscal year 2025 guidance anticipates 2-4% all-in sales growth and 3-5% organic sales growth. The company expects diluted EPS growth of 10-12% and core EPS growth of 5-7%. P&G also plans to pay around $10 billion in dividends and repurchase $6-7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025. The company faced challenges such as higher restructuring charges and an impairment charge on the Gillette intangible asset. Despite these, P&G remains committed to its integrated strategy focused on product superiority, productivity, and constructive disruption.",

(NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the second quarter 2024. \u201cDuring the second quarter, our business delivered net revenue growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth, remaining agile despite facing difficult net revenue growth comparisons versus the prior year, subdued category performance within North America convenient foods and the impacts associated with certain product recalls at Quaker Foods North America,\u201d said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.\nLaguarta continued, \u201cFor the balance of the year, we will further elevate and accelerate our productivity initiatives and make disciplined commercial investments in the marketplace to stimulate growth. These investments will focus on surgically providing optimal value propositions within certain portions of our North America convenient foods portfolio, amplifying our advertising and marketing initiatives and leveraging our go-to-market distribution capabilities to enable more precise marketplace execution. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4 percent) and have a high degree of confidence in delivering at least 8 percent core constant currency EPS growth for full-year 2024.\u201d 1 Please refer to the Glossary for the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, including \u201cOrganic revenue growth,\u201d \u201cCore\u201d and \u201cConstant currency,\u201d and to \u201cGuidance and Outlook\u201d for additional information regarding PepsiCo\u2019s full-year 2024 financial guidance.

For 2024, the Company now expects: \u2022 Approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4%). In addition, the Company continues to expect: \u2022 At least 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS; \u2022 A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; \u2022 Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8.2 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion; and \u2022 An approximate 1-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.\nThis assumption and the guidance above imply 2024 core EPS of at least $8.15, a 7 percent increase compared to 2023 core EPS of $7.62.\nPrepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast At approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will post prepared management remarks (in pdf format) of its second quarter 2024 results and business update, including its outlook for 2024, at www.pepsico.com/investors. At 8:15 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will host a live question and answer session with investors and financial analysts.

5 Non-GAAP Measures In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nImpairment and other charges/credits We recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in Tropicana Brands Group. We also recognized adjustments to charges recorded in prior years from changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.\nA - 6 Product recall-related impact We recognized property, plant and equipment and inventory write-offs, product returns, employee severance costs, customer and consumer-related costs and other costs in our Quaker Foods North America division associated with a previously announced voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 2024 guidance Our 2024 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2024 core effective tax rate guidance and our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges and other items noted above. Our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2024 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2024 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2024 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2024 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2024 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2024 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\nA - 7 PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information Organic Revenue Growth Rates 12 and 24 Weeks Ended June 15, 2024 (unaudited) 12 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America (0.5) % \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 % (4) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (18) % \u2014 \u2014 (18) % (17) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3.5) 5 Latin America 7 % (5) \u2014 2 % (5) 6 Europe 2.5 % 5 \u2014 7 % 2 5 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 11 (1) 12 % 1 11 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (2) % 3 \u2014 1 % \u2014 1.5 Total 1 % 1 \u2014 2 % (3) 5 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America 0.5 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (21) % \u2014 \u2014 (21) % (20) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (4) 5 Latin America 10 % (6) \u2014 4 % (3) 7 Europe 3 % 5.5 \u2014 8 % 2 6 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 8 \u2014 10 % 2 7 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region 2 % 4 \u2014 6 % 5 0.5 Total 1.5 % 1 \u2014 2 % (2) 5 (a) A financial measure that is not in accordance with GAAP.

(NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the second quarter 2024. \u201cDuring the second quarter, our business delivered net revenue growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth, remaining agile despite facing difficult net revenue growth comparisons versus the prior year, subdued category performance within North America convenient foods and the impacts associated with certain product recalls at Quaker Foods North America,\u201d said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.\nLaguarta continued, \u201cFor the balance of the year, we will further elevate and accelerate our productivity initiatives and make disciplined commercial investments in the marketplace to stimulate growth. These investments will focus on surgically providing optimal value propositions within certain portions of our North America convenient foods portfolio, amplifying our advertising and marketing initiatives and leveraging our go-to-market distribution capabilities to enable more precise marketplace execution. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4 percent) and have a high degree of confidence in delivering at least 8 percent core constant currency EPS growth for full-year 2024.\u201d 1 Please refer to the Glossary for the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, including \u201cOrganic revenue growth,\u201d \u201cCore\u201d and \u201cConstant currency,\u201d and to \u201cGuidance and Outlook\u201d for additional information regarding PepsiCo\u2019s full-year 2024 financial guidance.

For 2024, the Company now expects: \u2022 Approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4%). In addition, the Company continues to expect: \u2022 At least 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS; \u2022 A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; \u2022 Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8.2 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion; and \u2022 An approximate 1-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.\nThis assumption and the guidance above imply 2024 core EPS of at least $8.15, a 7 percent increase compared to 2023 core EPS of $7.62.\nPrepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast At approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will post prepared management remarks (in pdf format) of its second quarter 2024 results and business update, including its outlook for 2024, at www.pepsico.com/investors. At 8:15 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will host a live question and answer session with investors and financial analysts.

5 Non-GAAP Measures In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nImpairment and other charges/credits We recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in Tropicana Brands Group. We also recognized adjustments to charges recorded in prior years from changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.\nA - 6 Product recall-related impact We recognized property, plant and equipment and inventory write-offs, product returns, employee severance costs, customer and consumer-related costs and other costs in our Quaker Foods North America division associated with a previously announced voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 2024 guidance Our 2024 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2024 core effective tax rate guidance and our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges and other items noted above. Our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2024 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2024 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2024 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2024 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2024 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2024 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.

    "Document": "Personal Care Industry Size & Share Analysis - Growth Trends & Forecasts (2023 - 2028)\nThe Report Covers Global Beauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends and is segmented by Product Type (Personal Care Products and Cosmetics/Make-up Products); by Distribution Channel (Specialist Retail Stores, Supermarkets/Hypermarkets, Convenience Stores, Pharmacies/Drug Stores, Online Retail Channels, and Other Distribution Channel); by Category (Mass Products and Premium Products); and by Geography (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, South America, and Middle-East and Africa). The report offers market size and values in (USD Billion) during the forecasted years for the above segments.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Analysis\nThe Beauty and Personal Care Products Market size is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 4.64% over the next five years.\nMillennials are increasingly using beauty products like color cosmetics as part of their regular grooming routines. For instance, as of 2021, according to financial comparison service provider Mozo, the average Australian woman spent approximately USD 3,600 on beauty and personal care products yearly. The simple accessibility of these cosmetic items through various sales channels, with the increased emphasis on personal grooming, aided the sales value. Furthermore, the emergence of cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic components helped the market expansion. With the rising awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products, consumers are inclined toward organic personal care products. It is expected to drive market growth during the study period. Besides this, companies are capitalizing on consumers' demands to expand their share and consumer base in the market. For instance, in February 2022, a United Kingdom-based fashion company, Boohoo, launched a vegan beauty range of more than 50 products. Boohoo Beauty's cosmetics line includes highlighter sticks, blush, setting sprays, cosmetic palettes, and others available exclusively.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends\nInclination toward Natural/Organic Formulations\nThe growing concerns regarding the side effects of chemicals in personal care products, leading to skin irritation, allergies, and dullness, fueled the demand for natural and organic skincare products. Prolonged use of synthetic cosmetics may cause various health issues, such as irritation, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity. However, cosmetic products made of organic ingredients, such as plant extracts and natural oils, do not harm the skin. Natural skincare and cosmetic products that are free from chemicals and transparent about the content are preferred by consumers. This factor resulted in a shift in preference from synthetic skincare products to organic products among consumers.\nTo capitalize on this growing interest, manufacturers are revamping and expanding their product offerings by introducing a wide range of organic skincare products. These products contain plant-based, clean-label ingredients with organic, vegan, natural, chemical-free, and cruelty-free claims. For instance, in April 2022, Shiseido revealed a new skincare brand, Ul\u00e9. It sources pesticide-free botanicals from local vertical farms. The dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits of natural skincare led consumers to seek eco-friendly, sustainable, natural skincare products that offer greater product ingredient transparency. Furthermore, the growing trend of organic concepts through online stores for bio-cosmetic products is expected to boost the growth of the natural and organic beauty and personal care products market.\nAsia-Pacific Emerges as the Fastest-growing Region\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries like China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam present considerable growth opportunities for the market players. It is primarily due to the growing demand for color cosmetics, as many people unleash the potential of cosmetics in their daily makeup routine. Hence, the significant players are intensely embarking on product innovation and mergers and acquisitions as their prime strategy to consolidate the market. For instance, in April 2023, Personal care and beauty brand The Body Shop launched its 'activist' product range in the Indian market. The new line strengthens the brand's sustainable commitment in the country with a selection of skin products and color cosmetics.\nFurthermore, growing awareness regarding cosmetics products, such as facial makeup, hairstyling, and coloring products, with increasing demand for clean labels and natural ingredients, is expected to drive the market shortly. The need for multifunctional products is driving innovation as price-conscious consumers are opting for products that provide hydration and skin protection. The trend of social media influencers showcasing their beauty regimens increased over the past few years. Thus, both local and international beauty companies are turning to influencers to increase their brand awareness and reach potential consumers. For instance, in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, the Honest Company, a clean lifestyle company founded by Jessica Alba, launched its business in China. To capitalize on the relatively small but rising demand for sanitary beauty products, the digitally native company created a flagship store on Tmall Global, Alibaba Group's cross-border e-commerce platform. Chinese shoppers can purchase skin care and color cosmetics from Honest's brand, Honest Beauty. Shoppers on Tmall Global can select from various stock-keeping units, including its Extreme Length Mascara + Lash Primer and Hydrogel Cream, a face cream enriched with hyaluronic acid.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Industry Overview\nThe global beauty and personal care market is highly competitive, with a strong presence of regional and international players in the market like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. Demand is mainly driven by more adaptation toward skincare routines and consumer awareness about brand know-how. The companies improved the quality and product innovation regarding ingredients, functionality, and packaging. The key players are embarking on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation as their key strategies to achieve consolidation and optimize offerings. Moreover, these players merge with local players to gain dominance in the local market.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Leaders\nThe Procter & Gamble Company\nL'Oreal SA\nUnilever PLC\nColgate-Palmolive Company\nThe Estee Lauder Companies\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market News\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. For the full year, net revenues grew 6% to $45.8 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 12%, driven by 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. For both the quarter and the full year, organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across all operating segments.\n- Operating margin:\u00a0For the quarter, operating margin was 21.0% versus 20.5% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 23.1% versus 22.7% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin was 24.7% versus 25.4% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 29.1% versus 28.7% in the prior year. Operating margin performance included items impacting comparability and currency headwinds. For both the quarter and full year, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds.\n- Earnings per share:\u00a0For the quarter, EPS declined 2% to $0.46, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 10% to $0.49. EPS performance included the impact of a 14-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 13-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS grew 13% to $2.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 8% to $2.69. EPS performance included the impact of an 8-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 7-point currency headwind.\n- Market share:\u00a0For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.\n- Cash flow:\u00a0Cash flow from operations was $11.6 billion for the full year, an increase of $581 million versus the prior year, driven by strong business performance and working capital initiatives, partially offset by a transition tax payment and currency headwinds. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.7 billion for the full year, an increase of $213 million versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Connecting with consumers through experiences and digital engagement: The company continues to leverage its marketing transformation to build globally scaled marketing platforms tailored to local consumers. In the fourth quarter, \u201cThe World Needs More Santas\u201d campaign was executed in over 80 markets, continuing the company\u2019s rich history of celebrating the holidays. The company leveraged the success of its first AI-based platform, \u201cCreate Real Magic\u201d, by inviting consumers to create sharable, digital greeting cards featuring iconic brand assets such as cherished depictions of Santa Claus and the Coca\u2011Cola polar bear. Local initiatives generated buzz and excitement, such as the Coca\u2011Cola Caravan Truck Tour, which travelled throughout nearly 60 countries around the world making over a thousand stops and meeting over 16 million consumers to share in the magic. In total, the holiday campaign experiences garnered approximately 9 billion impressions on social media. By combining the company\u2019s global scale with local relevancy, the holiday activation contributed to Trademark Coca\u2011Cola\u00ae volume and value share gains as well as unit case volume and transactions growth for both the quarter and for the full year.\n-\u00a0Building a system that is increasingly positioned for sustainable long-term growth: Since the start of 2023, the company completed the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations in Vietnam to a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Limited (Swire), completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Pakistan to Coca\u2011Cola \u0130\u00e7ecek and completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Indonesia to Coca\u2011Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). More recently, the company completed the refranchising of a portion of its company-owned bottling operations in India to existing franchise bottlers and received regulatory approval to sell its bottling operations in the Philippines to CCEP and Aboitiz Equity Ventures, which is expected to close towards the end of February 2024. Additionally, the company recently completed the sale of its stake in the largest bottler in Thailand to Swire and existing shareholders of the bottler. Our franchise business model has enabled the company to develop a strong global footprint with a local touch in markets around the world. The company continuously works to optimize the system with trusted, capable and motivated bottling partners allowing it to focus on building and growing consumer-loved brands.\n-\u00a0Delivering on our purpose by empowering people to drive growth: The company\u2019s strategy is centered around people, starting with the employees who are critical in bringing this strategy to life. In November, the company was ranked #1 on the 2023 American Opportunity Index, which assessed how effectively companies enable employees to progress in their careers in the United States. Around the world, the company provides thousands of jobs and is invested in the long-term success of its employees. Over the year, the company enhanced its learning and related technologies, making strides towards nurturing a more innovative and informed workforce. The company\u2019s 2023 Culture & Engagement Survey results underscore the strong levels of employee pride and growth opportunities with a strong number of respondents saying they are proud to work at The Coca\u2011Cola Company and see good opportunities to learn and grow in their roles.\nOperating Review \u2013 Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\nOperating Review \u2013 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIn addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following:\n- Unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter.

The company has increased its dividend in each of the last 61 years.\n-\u00a0M&A initiatives: In 2023, the company did not make any significant acquisitions. The company continues to evaluate inorganic growth opportunities through brands and capabilities. In 2023, with respect to divestitures, the company made progress towards refranchising company-owned bottling operations.\n-\u00a0Share repurchases: In 2023, the company issued $0.5 billion of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchased $2.3 billion of shares. Consequently, net share repurchases (non-GAAP) were $1.7 billion. The company\u2019s remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $6 billion.\nOutlook\nThe 2024 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2024 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2024 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2024 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2024; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2024; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s full-year 2024 reported financial results.\nThe company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 6% to 7%.\nFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company\u2019s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.2%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail.\nGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 10% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 4% to 5%, versus $2.69 in 2023.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 4% to 5% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include an approximate 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe first quarter has one less day compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nNotes\n- All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.\n- All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales in the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. \u201cUnit case\u201d means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. \u201cUnit case volume\u201d means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.\n- \u201cConcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\n- \u201cPrice/mix\u201d represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.\n- First quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2022, and fourth quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2022. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.\nConference Call\nThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2023 operating results today, Feb. 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company\u2019s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section.

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The restructuring expenses of $55 million in the quarter ($479 million Q4 YTD) include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.\nIn fiscal 2023, the company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The restructuring expenses of $84 million in the quarter ($319 million Q4 YTD) primarily includes inventory and instrument reserves related to the market and product exits.\nEuropean Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company\u2019s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.\nThe tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted earnings.\n4.2%\n13.3%\n7.3%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(2.5)%\n12.4%\n2.9%\n0.2\n(0.1)\n0.1\n-\n-\n-\n0.6\n(0.4)\n0.2\n4.0%\n13.4%\n7.2%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(3.1)%\n12.8%\n2.7%\n(4.5)\n(1.6)\n(7.2)\n(2.3)\n(1.9)\n(0.7)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.3\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n4.0%\n9.1%\n5.7%\n9.5%\n7.2%\n8.8%\n(3.0)%\n11.0%\n2.1%\nInnovative

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The restructuring expenses of $55 million in the quarter ($479 million Q4 YTD) include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.\nIn fiscal 2023, the company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The restructuring expenses of $84 million in the quarter ($319 million Q4 YTD) primarily includes inventory and instrument reserves related to the market and product exits.\nEuropean Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company\u2019s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.\nThe tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted earnings.\n4.2%\n13.3%\n7.3%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(2.5)%\n12.4%\n2.9%\n0.2\n(0.1)\n0.1\n-\n-\n-\n0.6\n(0.4)\n0.2\n4.0%\n13.4%\n7.2%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(3.1)%\n12.8%\n2.7%\n(4.5)\n(1.6)\n(7.2)\n(2.3)\n(1.9)\n(0.7)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.3\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n4.0%\n9.1%\n5.7%\n9.5%\n7.2%\n8.8%\n(3.0)%\n11.0%\n2.1%\nInnovative
