Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company\u2019s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia\u2019s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%.\nNvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion.\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That\u2019s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year.\nGaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion.\nAnalysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%.\nInvestors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter.\nEven if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results.\nThat could have been a sign that some investors weren\u2019t impressed with Nvidia\u2019s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time.\nInvestors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company\u2019s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips.\n (NVDA)\nAt the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What\u2019s more, he said the company\u2019s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter.\nNvidia, however, is also facing an uncertain future, with president-elect Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. He\u2019s also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.\nThe vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      " News\n Life\n Entertainment\n  Finance\n Sports\nNew on Yahoo\nYahoo Finance\nNvidia to report Q3 earnings Wednesday as AI fever continues to power Wall Street\nIn This Article: \nNvidia (NVDA) will report its Q3 earnings after the bell next Wednesday, giving Wall Street its best and latest look into the strength of the AI trade.\nThe world\u2019s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia\u2019s stock price has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company\u2019s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia\u2019s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%.\nNvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion.\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That\u2019s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year.\nGaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion.\nAnalysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%.\nInvestors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter.\nEven if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results.\nThat could have been a sign that some investors weren\u2019t impressed with Nvidia\u2019s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time.\nInvestors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company\u2019s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips.\n (NVDA)\nAt the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What\u2019s more, he said the company\u2019s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter.\nNvidia, however, is also facing an uncertain future, with president-elect Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. He\u2019s also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.\nThe vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock\u2019s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I\u2019ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm\u2019s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla\u2019s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla\u2019s \u201cdifficult environment,\u201d the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it\u2019s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla\u2019s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla\u2019s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA\u2019s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla\u2019s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla\u2019s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company\u2019s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%.\nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla\u2019s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles.\nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that\u2019s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses.

Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

      "Knowledge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Top 5 Trends for Defence in 2024\r\n\t\t\t\nGreat challenges will bring huge opportunities in 2024, as the defence and aerospace industry seeks to rise to a diverse range of hurdles. Amid these headwinds, Defence Engage looks at the trends which could come to characterise 2024, from battling skills shortages to pivotal digitalisation efforts.\nMarked by ongoing conflicts in Israel-Palestine and Ukraine, 2024 will see ongoing tensions with China and Iran which pose significant threats to the international order. Geopolitical concerns aside, the industry grapples with supply chain issues, talent shortages, operational risks, and rising costs amid inflation. In the biggest global election year in history we could see significant strategic changes from key players such as the USA, UK, India, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. Here are the five key trends likely to dominate 2024\u2026\n\u00a0\n#1 AI and digitalisation efforts to bring security and efficiencies\nThe defence industry faces challenges in rapidly adopting new defensive systems and procedures to keep up with adversaries' technological innovations. From upgrading aging software to mitigate cyber threats, to expanding access to, and the adoption of, key cyber credentials, keeping up with digital trends remains pivotal. Meanwhile, governments are prioritising bringing AI to maturity while ensuring its development is safe and responsible. The rapid adoption of AI, spurred by recent advancements like Chat-GPT, is underway in industry, and indeed OpenAI has already started the year by easing its stance on the use of ChatGPT for military purposes.\nThe impact of AI for defence is forecast to be significant, from helping front-line users detect threats to activating cyber defences faster and with greater agility. Additionally, the integration of AI into defence supply chains could improve platform and parts delivery efficiency, reducing delays and costs, whilst improving security. Meanwhile, digital twins, coupled with machine learning, can enhance visibility of supply chain problems or complexities. According to a BAE report, 86% of defence and aerospace decision makers say their nation has adopted AI for defence applications, so the technology is set to become increasingly mature in 2024.\n\u00a0\n#2 Decarbonisation initiatives continue\nFollowing recent data which indicates that 2023 was the hottest year ever, the impetus behind decarbonisation efforts sees renewed urgency. The contribution of the global defence industry to carbon emissions has come under a microscope, with some having suggested that the sector had been overlooked, but there have been some major decarbonisation initiatives, including the establishment of NATO\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and the UK\u2019s Sustainable Support Strategy.\nThe impact of climate change upon defence goes beyond the weight of its own contributions, with both the UN and NATO describing climate change as a \u2018threat multiplier\u2019, alluding to the destabilising impact climate can have on societies and economies. Industry is rising to meet the challenge, with innovations such as new power solutions or increased circularity in manufacturing. \u00a0Last year the EU signalled its intention for defence supply chains to become more sustainable, alongside developing more localised energy in a drive for logistical resilience. Individual initiatives such as the Royal Air Force\u2019s first use of sustainable aviation fuel in a fighter aircraft are lighting the way towards a greener, more sustainable, military.\n\u00a0\n#3 Recruitment challenges to persist\nDefence is facing significant challenges when it comes to acquiring talent, skills and retention, from front-line military roles to cyber, quantum and manufacturing. In recent weeks the UK\u2019s Royal Navy has seen significant problems with hiring, at a critical time for the force, with ships being deployed to the Red Sea to counter Houthi Rebels. Last month, the Times reported that Armed forces and defence companies are locked in \u2018a war for talent\u2019.\nDwindling forces are due to the lack of recruits for basic training, a lack of digital skills, and the pull of incentives given by neighbouring sectors. The EU and US have recently signalled their plans to try and combat personnel shortages in key areas. The US\u2019 new Defence Industrial Strategy, cites \u2018workforce readiness\u2019 as a key strategic focus, with a desire to develop a \u2018sufficiently skilled and staffed workforce\u2019. Meanwhile, the European Commission expects skills shortages to increase into the future, with defence urgently requiring skills and talent acquisition, as procurement organisations seek to develop and manage emerging disruptive technologies.\n\u00a0\n#4 Agile supply chains to be prioritised\nThe scramble to arm Ukraine and Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China have highlighted US and allied supply chain vulnerabilities. The last couple of years have seen efforts to build a more resilient supply chain. The US CHIPS act and the EU CHIPS Act designed to securitise semiconductor supply, the European Defence Agency has set out to ensure \u2018security of supply\u2019 across the EU, and at the start of 2024, the US\u2019 Defence Industrial Strategy took aim at supply chain fragility, seeking to make it more sustainable alongside more flexible acquisition processes.\n2024 will see more emphasis on agile supply chains: increasing pressure to move away from lengthy procurement processes that cannot react quickly enough or where the end product could be outdated by the time it comes into service. There will be a race to secure and effect easy access to increasingly scarce resources such as minerals driven by the appetite for batteries and the move away from fossil fuels. The surge of additive manufacturing creates a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply option, while new military tactics such as the use of drones and increasing need for cyber security will continue to push military to commercial and more readily available solutions.\n\u00a0\n#5 Alliances and collaboration lead development and procurement\nCollaborative development programmes such as the sixth-generation fighter efforts: Tempest (by Italy, Japan and the UK) and FCAS (by France, Germany and Spain), are key initiatives designed to combine the best of each nation\u2019s domestic capabilities and combat declining resources. Meanwhile, the AUKUS programme demonstrates how two established nuclear navies (UK and US) are aiding Australia in bolstering Indo-Pacific security. Furthermore, NATO\u2019s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which opened its doors with three innovation challenges in 2023, has established test centres and accelerator units across Europe and North America. The collaboration of NATO members is nothing new, but this more centralised effort to progress on emerging disruptive technologies is hoped to go from strength to strength in 2024.\nGroup-purchases have become increasingly common amongst NATO allies in recent years, with a marked increase since the war in Ukraine began. Just two weeks ago, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain agreed to jointly purchase $5.5 billion worth of Patriot missiles following their effective use observed in Ukraine. Additionally, the research opportunities posed by the war in Ukraine have seen allies and industry testing experimental tech in partnership with Ukrainian soldiers, helping speed up development initiatives, particularly for drones. Following on from the big trend of multi-domain integration, Defence Engage expects multi-national development, purchases and bids to strengthen regional military power and aid embattled allies such as Israel and Ukraine, to continue in 2024 amid ongoing geopolitical upheaval.\n\u00a0\nKeep ahead of the trends\nDefence Engage connects suppliers and buyers to help make defence accessible, follow us on LinkedIn or register for our weekly Defence Contracts Digest to stay apprised of new solutions and collaboration opportunities this year.\nWant to discover more about how Defence Engage can enhance your lead-gen efforts and boost your discoverability in Defence?

To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has provided this non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n                  ($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\nOperating Income\nNet Income\nDiluted Earnings per Share\n2023 As Reported (GAAP)\n$52,857\n$22,352\n$18,299\n$2.45\n2024 As Reported (GAAP)\n$61,858\n$27,581\n$21,939\n$2.94\n\n                  Percentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\n\n                  17%\n\n                  23%\n\n                  20%\n\n                  20%\nConstant Currency Impact\n$189\n$167\n$(76)\n$(0.01)\n\n                  Percentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\n\n                  17%\n\n                  23%\n\n                  20%\n\n                  20%\n\nSegment Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n                  ($ in millions)\nProductivity and Business Processes\nIntelligent Cloud\nMore Personal Computing\n2023 As Reported (GAAP)\n$17,516\n$22,081\n$13,260\n2024 As Reported (GAAP)\n$19,570\n$26,708\n$15,580\n\n                  Percentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\n\n                  12%\n\n                  21%\n\n                  17%\nConstant Currency Impact\n$85\n$65\n$39\n\n                  Percentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\n\n                  11%\n\n                  21%\n\n                  17%\n\nSelected Product and Service Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation        \nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\nPercentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\nConstant Currency Impact\nPercentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\nMicrosoft Cloud\n23%\n0%\n23%\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services\n13%\n(1)%\n12%\nOffice 365 Commercial\n15%\n0%\n15%\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services\n4%\n0%\n4%\nLinkedIn\n10%\n(1)%\n9%\nDynamics products and cloud services\n19%\n(2)%\n17%\nDynamics 365\n23%\n(1)%\n22%\nServer products and cloud services\n24%\n0%\n24%\nAzure and other cloud services\n31%\n0%\n31%\nWindows\n11%\n0%\n11%\nWindows OEM\n11%\n0%\n11%\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services\n13%\n(1)%\n12%\nDevices\n(17)%\n1%\n(16)%\nXbox content and services\n62%\n(1)%\n61%\nSearch and news advertising excluding traffic acquisition costs\n12%\n0%\n12%\nAbout Microsoft\n\n        Microsoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) enables digital transformation for the era of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge.

We test these views by examining US stock buyback announcements data, and find little evidence to support these claims. There is some evidence that share buybacks are announced following a short-term period of stock price declines, which could either represent opportunistic purchasing at an attractive price or an attempt by management to stem the decline. However, on the whole, companies that announce share buybacks appear to have stronger-than-average fundamentals and long-term stock performance exceeding the market, with excess profits and cash flows that could reasonably be returned to shareholders.\nCorporate stock buybacks in the US have grown in frequency and size over the past decades (see Figure 1 below), leading to a host of concerns from\u00a0market\u00a0commentators. Among the most frequent concerns are that share purchases may be artificially propping up equity prices, suppressing market volatility, and weakening corporate balance sheets to name a few. In this\u00a0Street View, we test these views by examining nearly 25 years of US stock buyback announcements, and find little evidence to support the aforementioned concerns.\nThis\u00a0Street View\u00a0is structured as follows:\nWe performed our study on Russell 3000 Index constituents2\u00a0over a period spanning from Jan 1st, 1998 to Apr 30th, 2019. We used Bloomberg to obtain the list of share buyback announcement dates for these stocks over the period of study. There were a total of 9,698 buyback announcements,3\u00a0though accounting for multiple announcements from the same company in the same month resulted in 7,327 unique buyback events.\nWe base all the results presented in sections 3 and 4 on idiosyncratic returns to the Russell 3000 constituents relative to a CAPM-style risk model (i.e., after adjusting for the estimated market beta of each stock).\u00a04\nWe start by investigating the claim that companies tend to announce buybacks when their stock prices are declining or amid rising volatility, potentially as an attempt by management to support prices and/or reduce stock volatility. To test how past stock performance may affect the probability of a buyback announcement in the subsequent month, we use a logistic regression model5\u00a0to estimate the probability of a firm announcing a share buyback in the next month conditional on two measures of trailing performance:6\nWe split our analysis into two discrete periods: before and after the Global Financial Crisis,7\u00a0as we found notable differences in their results. To account for time-varying dispersion in the returns and volatilities of individual stocks, we also transform the historical Sharpe ratios and volatility ratios for all 3,000 stocks within each calendar month into cross-sectional z-scores before fitting the logistic regressions over all stock-month observations in each period.\nThe table below shows the z-scores quantifying the statistical significance of the dependence of the likelihood of a stock buyback announcement on the two measures of past performance we described above. A score with an absolute value greater than 2.0 roughly denotes a statistically significant relationship. A positive (negative) value of the score implies that the higher the value of the predictor, the higher (lower) the likelihood of a buyback announcement in the next month.\nA handful of key results from Table 1 deserve highlighting:\nWe can check the robustness of these regression results by also looking at the empirical frequency of buyback announcements for stock-month observations with historical Sharpe ratio or volatility ratio z-scores falling into particular narrow ranges, and plotting those empirical frequencies against the estimated probability from our logistic regression. Figure 2 shows these plots for the post-GFC period with a 36-month lookback window for both stock performance metrics. Again, there are a handful of results to highlight:\n\nMore broadly, these results suggest that buybacks tend to come from firms with strong long-term performance whose share prices had recently hit a rough patch, but without much rise in volatility. This provides some support for the hypothesis that management tends to opportunistically announce buybacks when shares appear undervalued, or as a short-term price support.8\nThe post-GFC data especially does not support the hypothesis that share buybacks have been suppressing broader market volatility, as buybacks tend to be announced more often by firms with level or declining volatility compared to history. However, this finding does not rule out the counterfactual possibility that firms announcing buybacks avoided a rise in share price volatility that would have otherwise occurred. To investigate the potential impact of share buybacks on the broader market\u2019s returns and volatility, we now turn to analyzing the average impact on share prices before and after the announcement.\nBy performing an event time study, we estimated the cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR) in excess of the market earned by Russell 3000 Index constituents that announce a share buyback over the period immediately preceding and following the announcement month. Our results, in Figure 3, suggest that while a typical buyback announcer is selling off in the six months leading up to the buyback announcement (as shown in the previous section), the post-announcement recovery is relatively weak.\nLeading up to the buyback announcement, the average announcer\u2019s share price has been selling off, with noticeably larger negative CAAR for the pre-GFC period than post-GFC. This squares with the logistic regression results in Table 1: both periods show that buybacks tend to be more likely following a six-month period with a negative idiosyncratic returns Sharpe ratio, but the pre-GFC period also shows buybacks tend to follow rising idiosyncratic volatility, while there is no such effect in the post-GFC period. As the historical Sharpe ratio measure used in this study divides the average idiosyncratic returns by the idiosyncratic volatility, the larger denominator (from rising volatility) in the pre-GFC period suggests we should also see more strongly negative returns in the numerator.\nThe announcement month itself shows a positive market response, with roughly 0.5-0.75% average excess returns in both the pre- and post-GFC datasets.9\u00a0Here, the results from the two periods diverge again, as buyback announcers do not recover any further on average over the pre-GFC period, while the postGFC period shows an average recovery roughly to the pre-selloff level. Although the total trough-to-peak recovery for buyback announcers in the post-GFC period appears strongly statistically significant,10\u00a0the total CAAR from the beginning of the sell-off to six months after the announcement is less than 0.5% and not statistically significant.11\u00a0While the buyback announcement does appear to provide share price support in the more recent dataset, the recovery to pre-selloff levels suggests that buybacks on average do not appear to lead to \u201cartificially\u201d elevated valuations.12\nFigure 3 implies a stark difference in the recovery of a stock\u2019s price after a share buyback announcement across the pre and post GFC periods. This could point to the possibility of markets becoming more efficient in pricing a buyback announcement over recent years that now leads to quicker price recovery than what is observed pre GFC. Many other possibilities exist, such as a significant change in financial regulation post GFC, changes in market structure due to an increased flow of capital into quantitative trading strategies, and etc. This difference is an interesting question in itself and we defer its investigation to a future\u00a0Street View.\nWe now turn to the effects on share price volatility, with Figure 4 presenting the average daily idiosyncratic volatility of a buyback announcer over the twelve months preceding and following the announcement month. As suggested by the regression results in Section 3, the pre-GFC period shows a rise in short-term volatility in the months leading up to the buyback announcement, while this effect is much less clear in the post-GFC data. Volatility spikes in the announcement month for both periods as the market digests the news, with a positive average outcome as seen in Figure 3.\nHowever, share price volatility is not suppressed after a buyback is announced. In fact, the average level of idiosyncratic volatility post-announcement is slightly higher than the preannouncement volatility in both the pre- and post-GFC periods.13\u00a0We note that this effect is actually in the direction that a simple corporate finance model would suggest, as a share buyback should increase the leverage of a company\u2019s equity while leaving the underlying business risk unchanged, thus boosting the expected equity volatility.\nFinally, we want to take a deeper look at the fundamental characteristics of companies that announce share buybacks versus the broader market, to see if the data supports beliefs that companies are significantly weakening their balance sheets or foregoing worthwhile investment to return capital. To test for significant differences between firms announcing a buyback and the average Russell 3000 firm, we used the style factor definitions from MSCI Barra\u2019s most recent US risk model: the US Total Market Equity Trading Model. These style factor exposures per stock provide point-in-time scores for how each individual stock compares to the rest of the US market on a large number of dimensions, including technical factors such as momentum, beta, and residual volatility; fundamental factors such as firm profitability, earnings quality (mostly driven by cash earnings being in line with accounting earnings), and leverage; and measures combining market prices and fundamentals such as valuation metrics and market capitalization.\nWe investigated which characteristics most strongly differentiated buyback announcers from the rest of the market by comparing the distribution of scores (or loadings) on each style factor for stocks on the day before their buyback announcements to the loadings of all the stocks in our study. We performed a difference-of-means test between the two distributions to determine which style factor loadings showed statistically significant differences from the market as a whole, and the results of this analysis for the factors with the most significant differences between the buyback announcers and the broad market are presented in Figure 5 below.\nStocks announcing a share buyback tend to have significantly stronger fundamentals than average, with higher scores on Earnings Yield (i.e., lower price-to-earnings ratio), Earnings Quality (i.e., more cash earnings), and Profitability (i.e., higher return on equity and return on assets). These firms also tend to be larger (positive Size and Mid-Cap loadings), with lower Leverage and lower market-implied risk (both lower Beta and lower Residual Volatility).\nThese results suggest that corporations buying back stock are exactly those with the greatest ability to return cash to shareholders while still supporting future growth, and provide little evidence that the firms are endangering themselves through excess leverage to fund the capital returns.\nContrary to the worst claims about share buybacks, we find little evidence from our large-scale study of individual buyback announcements that they are artificially suppressing market volatility or requiring companies to forgo otherwise profitable investments or take on excess leverage. There is some evidence that share buybacks are announced following a short-term period of stock price declines, which could either represent opportunistic purchasing at an attractive price or an attempt by management to stem the decline.14\u00a0However, on the whole, companies that announce share buybacks appear to have stronger-than-average fundamentals and long-term stock performance exceeding the market, with excess profits and cash flows that could reasonably be returned to shareholders.\nOur study points towards a noticeable difference in the extent of post buyback announcement price recovery across the pre and post GFC periods. One could think of a few\u00a0a priori\u00a0explanations for this difference (that we mention in Section 4); we pose this as an open question to the wider Financial Economics research community and plan to revisit this topic in a future\u00a0Street View.\nTags\nReferences\nStephen Gandel. \u201cAdd Stock Buybacks to the Causes of the Market Downturn.\u201d Bloomberg.

      "Stock Buybacks: Benefits of Share Repurchases\n There are several ways in which a company can return wealth to its shareholders. Although stock price appreciation and\u00a0dividends\u00a0are the two most common ways, there are other ways for companies to share their wealth with investors.\n\n In this article, we will look at one of those overlooked methods: share buybacks or repurchases. We'll go through the mechanics of a share\u00a0buyback\u00a0and what it means for investors.\n\nKey Takeaways\n  What Is a Stock Buyback?\u00a0  \n A stock buyback occurs when a company buys back its shares from the marketplace with its accumulated cash. Also known as a share repurchase, a stock buyback allows a company to re-invest in itself. The repurchased shares are absorbed by the company, reducing the number of outstanding shares\u00a0on the market. Because there are fewer shares on the market, the relative ownership stake of each investor increases.\n\n There are two ways that companies conduct a buyback: A tender offer or through the open market:\n\nJOSH EDELSON\u00a0/\u00a0Contributor / Getty Images\n  The Motives  \n Why do companies buy back shares? A firm's management is likely to say that a buyback is the best use of\u00a0capital\u00a0at that particular time. After all, the goal of a firm's management is to maximize return for shareholders, and a buyback typically increases\u00a0shareholder value. The prototypical line in a buyback\u00a0press release\u00a0is \"we don't see any better investment than in ourselves.\" Although this can sometimes be the case, this statement is not always true.\n\n There are other sound motives that drive companies to repurchase shares. For example, management may feel the market has discounted its share price too steeply.\ufeff A stock price can be pummeled by the market for many reasons such as weaker-than-expected earnings results, an accounting scandal, or just a poor overall economic climate. Thus, when a company spends millions of dollars buying up its own shares, it can be a sign that management believes that the market has gone too far in\u00a0discounting\u00a0the shares\u2014a positive sign.\n\n\nThe market typically perceives a buyback as a positive indicator for a company, and the share price often shoots up following a buyback. On May 2, 2024, Apple (APPL) announced $110 billion for share buybacks.\n  Improving Financial Ratios  \n A corporation may execute a share buyback to improve its financial ratios. These are the\u00a0metrics that investors use to analyze a company's value. But this motivation is questionable. That's because reducing the number of shares may signal issues with management. But if a company's motive for initiating a buyback is sound, better financial ratios as a result could simply be a byproduct of a good corporate decision.\n\n Let's look at how this happens:\n\n  Example  \n Suppose a company repurchases one million shares at $15 per share for a total cash outlay of $15 million. Below are the components of the ROA and\u00a0earnings per share (EPS) calculations and how they change as a result of the buyback.\n\n As you can see, the company's\u00a0cash hoard was reduced from $20 million to $5 million. Because cash is an asset, this will lower the total assets of the company from $50 million to $35 million. This increases ROA, even though earnings don't change. Prior to the buyback, the company's ROA was 4% ($2 million \u00f7 $50 million). After the repurchase, ROA increases to 5.71% ($2 million \u00f7 $35 million). A similar effect can be seen for EPS, which increases from 20 cents ($2 million \u00f7 10 million shares) to 22 cents ($2 million \u00f7 9 million shares).\n\n The buyback also improves the company's\u00a0price-earnings ratio (P/E), which is one of the most well-known and often-used measures of value. At the risk of oversimplification, the market often thinks a lower P/E ratio is better. Therefore, if we assume that the shares remain at $15, the P/E ratio before the buyback is 75 ($15 \u00f7 20 cents). After the buyback, the P/E decreases to 68 ($15 \u00f7 22 cents) due to the reduction in outstanding shares. In other words, fewer shares + same earnings = higher EPS, which leads to a better P/E.\n\n Based on the P/E ratio as a measure of value, the company is now less expensive per dollar of earnings than it was prior to the repurchase despite the fact there was no change in earnings.\n\n  Dilution  \n Another reason that a company may move forward with a buyback is to reduce the\u00a0dilution\u00a0that is often caused by generous\u00a0employee stock option plans (ESOP).\n\n Bull markets\u00a0and strong economies often create a very competitive labor market. Companies have to compete to retain personnel, and ESOPs comprise many compensation packages. Stock options have the opposite effect of share repurchases as they increase the number of shares outstanding when the options are\u00a0exercised.\n\n As in the above example, a change in the number of outstanding shares can affect key financial measures such as EPS and P/E. In the case of dilution, a change in the number of outstanding shares has the opposite effect of repurchase: it weakens the financial appearance of the company.\n\n If we assume that the shares in the company had increased by one million, the EPS would have fallen to 18 cents per share from 20 cents per share. After years of\u00a0lucrative\u00a0stock option programs, a company may decide to repurchase shares to avoid or eliminate excessive dilution.\n\n  Tax Benefit\u00a0  \n On Aug. 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. One of the provisions included an excise tax of 1% on share buybacks. The new rule goes into effect for repurchases after Dec. 31, 2022, that are valued at over $1 million. And it excludes stock that is reserved for new public issues and for employee stock or pension plans.\n\n Prior to this, corporations generally weren't taxed at all if they repurchased their shares and boosted value for their shareholders. This is contrary to the tax treatment of dividends, which is a portion of a company's earnings distributed to shareholders. Dividends are taxed at ordinary\u00a0income tax\u00a0rates when received. Tax rates and their effects typically change annually. As such, investors consider the annual tax rate on capital gains versus dividends as ordinary income when looking at the benefits.\n\n\nThe idea for an excise tax was introduced by Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH). The Stock Buyback Accountability Act was introduced in the Senate in September 2021 and proposed a 2% tax on share buybacks. The bill aimed to address concerns that corporate executives used buybacks to benefit themselves by boosting share prices rather than investing in the economy and their workers.\nWhy Do Companies Buyback Shares?\nThere are many reasons that a company may wish to buyback its shares. Often companies with excess capital will say that share buybacks are the best use of their capital because it will have the effect of maximizing value for the shareholders.\nIs Share Buyback a Good Thing?\nIf the reason for the share buyback is to maximize shareholder value, then it is a good thing.\nAre Share Buybacks Better Than Dividends?\nShare buybacks are a more efficient way to return capital to shareholders because the shareholder doesn't incur any additional tax on the buyback. Taxes are only triggered once the shareholder sells the shares.\n  The Bottom Line\u00a0  \n Are share buybacks good or bad? As is so often the case in finance, the question may not have a definitive answer. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding and a company\u2019s total assets, which can affect the company and its investors in different ways. When you look at key ratios like EPS and P/E, a share decrease boosts EPS and lowers the P/E for a more attractive value. Ratios, such as ROA and ROE, improve because the denominator decreases, which increases the return.\n\n In the public market, a buyback will always increase the stock\u2019s value to the benefit of shareholders. However, investors should ask whether a company is merely using buybacks to prop up ratios, provide short-term relief to an ailing stock price, or get out from under excessive dilution.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"Tax Provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (H.R. 5376),\" Page 3.\nApple.com. \"Apple Reports Second Quarter Results.\"\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 550 (2021), Investment Income and Expenses.\"\nCongress.gov. \"S.2758 - Stock Buyback Accountability Act of 2021.\"\nThomson Reuters. \"The Long Read: Excise on Stock Buybacks Draws Mixed Response.\"\n"

Why has the society not made faster progress on cancer front? Why do discoveries in biotechnology sector occur in fits and spurts? We claim that this slow and sporadic progress has a lot to do with the vagaries of capital markets. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begin with a success story. There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cleverage Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.\u00c2\u00a0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\n",

Results from Phase I, II and III clinical studies, and FDA or European approvals (and rejections), can send stocks soaring.\nEveryone is familiar with these monster moves. Recent examples include Amarin Corp's (AMRN) 3X move in one day, or Zosano Pharma Corporations' (ZSAN) 100% rip on recent study results. Now, a new entrant in the large neurological market, NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC), could be on the eve of their first FDA approval, and few investors are paying attention to this small company because it's so new and quiet about what they're doing.\nNevertheless, NMTC is 10% owned by the Mayo Clinic and has a stable of veteran physicians and researchers on their board and advisory board. With the possibility of two FDA clearances in 2019 for their first planned medical devices, the company could have a breakout year if they execute and move from unknown to mainstream.\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2019 / Small healthcare stocks are known for making heroic moves, often when their development-phase drugs or devices move closer to going commercial. Completion of Phase I, II, and III trials can all send stocks rallying, as can approvals from European and U.S. regulators.\nCase in point, Zosano Pharma's (ZSAN) recent monster 100% move recently when they announced success in a Trial of their drug for migraines. Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren't paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne's technologies - sometimes known as ''neurostimulation'' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company's public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt's an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson's using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson's, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson's, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient's skull!\nHere's where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company's initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne's technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they've already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they're working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC's public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic's Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company's scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company's new \"artificial intelligence\" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne's electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa's successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

Mitigation plans involve massive engineering feats that may help in the short-term, but will eventually be overrun.\nEarth.Org takes a closer look.\n\u2014\nA major centre of finance, commerce, culture, arts and trade, Miami is a global city with a USD $345 billion GDP. Built on a broad, low-lying plain between Everglades wetlands and Biscayne Bay, its citizens are already experiencing early signs of climate change.\nWhy?\nSince 1870, global sea levels have risen by an average of 20 cm, but Southeast Florida\u2019s local levels have risen by 30 cm. By 2060, it could double or triple that.\u00a0\nThe impacts of sea level rise in Miami\nIn light of the last point, officials have decided to build a network of huge pumps that force water out of flood-prone areas and into Biscayne Bay. There are over 30 pumps today, with 90 planned in total. The estimated cost for 3 pumps, including land acquisition, is USD $ 200 million. Unfortunately, even all 90 cannot protect the larger Miami area.\u00a0\nThe city of Miami still toils away to mitigate flooding, raising roads and buildings, hoping to buy time. The world would do well to keep an eye on how Miami fares, as it may be the first major victim of climate change.\nEarth.Org has mapped severe flooding in southern Florida by the end of the century to illustrate the impending danger.\nSea Level Rise: Miami\u2019s Map\nSea level rise projections by 2100 for two scenarios with the amount of rise in meters indicated (mild = 1m; extreme = 4m). Percentage and total population displacement indicated bottom right, yellow star on the city of Miami.\nMethodology\nGlobal mean sea level is projected to rise by 2m at the end of this century. However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level. While in extreme cases like China and the Netherlands it could experience 5-10m of extreme sea levels. Here, the coastal local flood level is added on top of the projected SLR.\nPollution Scenario:\nAllows choosing the RCP, the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory defined by the IPCC.\u00a0 The mild level is based on RCP4.5, of 2\u00b0C temperature rise; while the Extreme level is based on RCP 8.5, of 4\u00b0C temperature rise.\nLuck:\nApplies to the baseline SLR, defined in the \u201cSea level projection\u201d section, upon which we add flooding. \u201cMild\u201d refers to the mid-range scenario of 0.5-1.2m, and \u201cextreme\u201d to the pessimistic scenario of 1-2.5m.

      "Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\nMain navigation\nHeader Buttons\nBreadcrumb\nWhere Does the Budget Stand Compared to Historical Averages?\n\nRecently, there has been a lot of discussion over whether the country has a revenue problem or a spending problem. While there is no way to definitively answer that question \u2013 by definition, our fiscal problems are due to the disconnect between spending and revenue \u2013 one way to evaluate our situation would be to put spending and revenue in a historical context as a share of economic output. From that perspective, it is clear the answer is \"both.\"\nIncorporating the effects of the recent budget deal, federal spending is expected to total 21.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, while revenue is expected to total about 16.6 percent of GDP. With 50-year historical averages for spending and revenue at 20.3 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, that means spending will be higher and revenue will be lower than their historical\u00a0averages by about the same amount:\u00a00.8 percent of GDP.\nThis wasn't always so. As recently as 2017, revenue was close to its historical average, and as recently as 2018, spending was as well. But thanks in large part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, both have departed from these averages.\nDue to the rising costs of health, retirement, and interest spending, spending is projected to diverge from its average even further. We estimate that over the next decade, spending will rise to 23.1\u00a0percent of GDP by 2029, which is 2.8 percentage points\u00a0above the historical average. Revenue will rise above its historical average but largely because the net revenue-losing portions of the TCJA are scheduled to expire, mostly after 2025. If those and other tax cuts were continued as the Congressional Budget Office presents in its Alternative Fiscal Scenario (AFS), revenue would remain below its historical average at least through the next decade, with revenue 0.4 percentage points below that average in 2029.\u00a0\nThe fact that spending and revenue are above and below their historical averages, respectively, is troubling, especially since even at these\u00a0averages debt has risen by about 50 percent of GDP over the past half century to its highest level since just after World War II.\nIn the past when the economy was strong and unemployment was low, revenue usually rose above average levels as a share of GDP while spending fell below. This time, policymakers have continued to cut taxes and increase spending regardless of the fiscal consequences.\nTrending\n$700 Billion of Easy Deficit Reduction\nWith the national debt approaching record levels and interest costs exploding, lawmakers will need to consider substantial spending cuts and revenue increases to put the national debt on a more...\nAs the Fed Cuts Rates, Treasury Yields Are Rising\nWith last week\u2019s rate decision, the Federal Reserve has now cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points over the past eight weeks.

Click on icons in the map to view sea level rise simulations at specific locations. \nWater levels are relative to local Mean Higher High Water Datum. Areas that are hydrologically connected to the ocean are shown in shades of blue (darker blue = greater depth).\nLow-lying areas, displayed in green, are hydrologically \"unconnected\" areas that may also flood. They are determined solely by how well the elevation data captures the area\u2019s drainage characteristics. The mapping may not accurately capture detailed hydrologic/hydraulic features such as canals, ditches, and stormwater infrastructure. A more detailed analysis, may be required to determine the area\u2019s actual susceptibility to flooding.\nThere is not 100% confidence in the elevation data and/or mapping process. It is important not to focus on the exact extent of inundation, but rather to examine the level of confidence that the extent of inundation is accurate (see mapping confidence tab).\nScenarios\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research\r\n                            Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios\r\n                            provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            While these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter)\r\n                            scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has\r\n                            been removed.\r\n                        \n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\r\n                            The five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report\r\n                            NOS CO-OPS 083: \u201cGlobal and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\u201d using the same\r\n                            methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator. These new\r\n                            scenarios were developed by the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools\r\n                            Interagency Task Force, jointly convened by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the\r\n                            National Ocean Council as input to the USGCRP Sustained Assessment process and Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

As sea levels increase, some\r\n                            marshes may migrate into neighboring low-lying areas, while other sections of marsh will change type or\r\n                            be lost to open water.\r\n                        \nUnderstanding the Scenarios\n\r\n                            The scenarios are derived from NOAA Sea Level Rise Technical Reports and take into account global\r\n                            mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to\r\n                            ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion. You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities.

In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\n",

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows. Source: CoCoRaHS Mapping Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 4 2.\nRainfall Runoff and Urban Flooding Basics Cities and highly urbanized areas have many buildings and paved surfaces, including streets, parking lots, and sidewalks. When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

Click on icons in the map to view sea level rise simulations at specific locations. \nWater levels are relative to local Mean Higher High Water Datum. Areas that are hydrologically connected to the ocean are shown in shades of blue (darker blue = greater depth).\nLow-lying areas, displayed in green, are hydrologically \"unconnected\" areas that may also flood. They are determined solely by how well the elevation data captures the area\u2019s drainage characteristics. The mapping may not accurately capture detailed hydrologic/hydraulic features such as canals, ditches, and stormwater infrastructure. A more detailed analysis, may be required to determine the area\u2019s actual susceptibility to flooding.\nThere is not 100% confidence in the elevation data and/or mapping process. It is important not to focus on the exact extent of inundation, but rather to examine the level of confidence that the extent of inundation is accurate (see mapping confidence tab).\nScenarios\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research\r\n                            Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios\r\n                            provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            While these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter)\r\n                            scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has\r\n                            been removed.\r\n                        \n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\r\n                            The five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report\r\n                            NOS CO-OPS 083: \u201cGlobal and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\u201d using the same\r\n                            methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator. These new\r\n                            scenarios were developed by the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools\r\n                            Interagency Task Force, jointly convened by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the\r\n                            National Ocean Council as input to the USGCRP Sustained Assessment process and Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

As sea levels increase, some\r\n                            marshes may migrate into neighboring low-lying areas, while other sections of marsh will change type or\r\n                            be lost to open water.\r\n                        \nUnderstanding the Scenarios\n\r\n                            The scenarios are derived from NOAA Sea Level Rise Technical Reports and take into account global\r\n                            mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to\r\n                            ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion. You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities.

In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\n",

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows. Source: CoCoRaHS Mapping Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 4 2.\nRainfall Runoff and Urban Flooding Basics Cities and highly urbanized areas have many buildings and paved surfaces, including streets, parking lots, and sidewalks. When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

NASA developed the global sea level change website in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, the World Bank, the U.S. Department of State, and the United Nations Development Programme. \u00a0\nThe site includes information on projected sea level rise through the year 2150 for coastlines around the world, as well as estimates of how much flooding a coastal community or region can expect to see in the next 30 years. The projections come from data collected by NASA and its partners and from computer models of ice sheets and the ocean, as well as the latest sea level assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other sources.\n\u201cNASA innovates for the benefit of humanity. Our cutting-edge instruments and data-driven information tools help communities and organizations respond to natural hazards and extreme weather, and inform critical coastal infrastructure planning decisions,\u201d said Karen St. Germain, director of the Earth science division at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nInformation to Action\nInternational organizations such as the World Bank will use the data from the global sea level change site for tasks including the creation of Climate Risk Profiles for countries especially vulnerable to sea level rise.\nThe Defense Department will continue to incorporate sea level rise data into its plans to anticipate and respond to hazards posed to its facilities by the effects of rising oceans. Similarly, the State Department uses the information for activities ranging from disaster preparedness to long-term adaptation planning to supporting partners around the world in related efforts.\n\u201cWe are at a moment of truth in our fight against the climate crisis. The science is unequivocal and must serve as the bedrock upon which decision-making is built. With many communities around the world already facing severe impacts from sea-level rise, this new resource provides a vital tool to help them protect lives and livelihoods. It also illustrates what is at stake between a 1.5-degree-Celsius world and a current-policies trajectory for all coastal communities worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Secretary-General Selwin Hart, special adviser to the United Nations secretary-general on climate action and just transition.\nRising Faster\nNASA-led data analyses have revealed that between 1970 and 2023, 96% of countries with coastlines have experienced sea level rise. The rate of that global rise has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) per year in 1993 to about 0.18 inches (0.45 centimeters) per year in 2023.\nAs the rate of sea level rise increases, millions of people could face the related effects sooner than previously projected, including larger storm surges, more saltwater intrusion into groundwater, and additional high-tide flood days \u2014 also known as nuisance floods or sunny day floods.\n\u201cThis new platform shows the timing of future floods and the magnitude of rising waters in all coastal countries worldwide, connecting science and physics to impacts on people\u2019s livelihoods and safety,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director of the ocean physics program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nData released earlier this year found that Pacific Island nations will experience at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) of sea level rise in the next 30 years. The number of high-tide flood days will increase by an order of magnitude for nearly all Pacific Island nations by the 2050s.\n\u201cThe data is clear: Sea levels are rising around the world, and they\u2019re rising faster and faster,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and head of the agency\u2019s sea level change science team. \u201cHaving the best information to make decisions about how to plan for rising seas is more crucial than ever.\u201d\nTo explore the global sea level change site:\nhttps://earth.gov/sealevel\nNews Media Contacts\nKaren Fox / Elizabeth VlockNASA Headquarters, Washington202-358-1600karen.c.fox@nasa.gov / elizabeth.a.vlock@nasa.gov\nJane J.

      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",

      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",
      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 (4/14/24) Gregg Ibendahl April 16, 2024 Week #15 prediction Kansas wheat estimate for 4/14/24 Yield range from 41.5 to 45.9 Predicted yield of 43.7 Introduction1 The USDA collects weekly crop conditions throughout the growing season. The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7"

      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 (4/14/24) Gregg Ibendahl April 16, 2024 Week #15 prediction Kansas wheat estimate for 4/14/24 Yield range from 41.5 to 45.9 Predicted yield of 43.7 Introduction1 The USDA collects weekly crop conditions throughout the growing season. The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7",
      "Main Menu\nBreadcrumb\nClimate Change: Global Temperature\nYearly surface temperature compared to the 20th-century average from 1880\u20132022. Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\u00a0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals\u2014expanding some and shrinking others.\u00a0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget\u2014how much sunlight\u00a0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat\u2014over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\u00a0temperature readings\u00a0to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\u00a0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\u00a0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The \"coolest\" month was November, which was 1.35 \u02daF (0.75 \u02daC) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)\u2013the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86\u00b0C (1.55\u00b0F) above the 20th century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F). This value is 0.13\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02\u00b0C (0.04\u00b0F) higher than the last year's (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014\u20132022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's\u00a02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\u00a0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\u00a00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\u00a0Celsius)\u00a0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 \u00b0F (0.18 \u00b0C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities\u2014burning fossil fuels and clearing forests\u2014add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (\"representative concentration pathways,\" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns. (right)\u00a0 Projected temperature increase relative to the 1901-1960 average depending on which RCP we eventually follow. Image by Katharine Hayhoe, from the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nAccording to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,\u00a0 models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.\nReferences\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2023).

      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 (4/14/24) Gregg Ibendahl April 16, 2024 Week #15 prediction Kansas wheat estimate for 4/14/24 Yield range from 41.5 to 45.9 Predicted yield of 43.7 Introduction1 The USDA collects weekly crop conditions throughout the growing season. The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7",
      "Main Menu\nBreadcrumb\nClimate Change: Global Temperature\nYearly surface temperature compared to the 20th-century average from 1880\u20132022. Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\u00a0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals\u2014expanding some and shrinking others.\u00a0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget\u2014how much sunlight\u00a0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat\u2014over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\u00a0temperature readings\u00a0to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\u00a0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\u00a0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The \"coolest\" month was November, which was 1.35 \u02daF (0.75 \u02daC) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)\u2013the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86\u00b0C (1.55\u00b0F) above the 20th century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F). This value is 0.13\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02\u00b0C (0.04\u00b0F) higher than the last year's (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014\u20132022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's\u00a02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\u00a0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\u00a00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\u00a0Celsius)\u00a0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 \u00b0F (0.18 \u00b0C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities\u2014burning fossil fuels and clearing forests\u2014add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (\"representative concentration pathways,\" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns. (right)\u00a0 Projected temperature increase relative to the 1901-1960 average depending on which RCP we eventually follow. Image by Katharine Hayhoe, from the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nAccording to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,\u00a0 models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.\nReferences\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2023).

      "\nMain Menu\nBreadcrumb\nU.S. climate outlook for September 2024\nAfter a very hot early and middle part of summer, August provided a welcome relief across much of the nation, with much-above-normal temperatures largely confined to the Deep South. The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer.\nSummer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August.\nAs we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here\u2019s the outlook from NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September.\nThe U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September.\u00a0Much warmer\u00a0or\u00a0much cooler than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nOn August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above average temperatures across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above average precipitation along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest.\nThe precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September.\u00a0Much higher\u00a0or\u00a0much lower than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nIn addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I\u2019ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here\u2019s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the most likely outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found here.\nThe updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC\u2019s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With the expected arrival of La Ni\u00f1a somewhat delayed, it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry) can influence temperatures and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks.\nTemperature outlook favors more heat in the West, uncertainty in much of the East\nThe September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. (Well above average means \u201cin the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.\u201d) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with equal chance odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions.\nThe best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is \u201cequal chances\u201d along the coast.\nIt\u2019s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so \u201cequal chances\u201d is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month.\nPrecipitation outlook tilts wet in across the South, mainly dry across the North\nThe precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-\u201cequal chances\u201d forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough.\nBelow-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods.\nU. S. Drought area increases further during August\nThe amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing extreme and exceptional drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards.\nThe summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our\u00a0Data Snapshots Collection,\u00a0based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project.\u00a0\nRegionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north.\nDrought outlook mainly predicts persistence and development, but improvement across parts of the South\nU.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See\u00a0CPC version\u00a0for Alaska and Hawaii.\nWith above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.\nTo read the entire discussion of the monthly climate outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center, check out their\u00a0website.\nWe value your feedback\nHelp us improve our content\nRelated Content\nNEWS & FEATURES\nMAPS & DATA\nTEACHING CLIMATE\nCLIMATE RESILIENCE TOOLKIT\nStay Connected\n",
      "Secretary Naig: \u201cIowa Remained a Production Powerhouse\u201d\nDES MOINES, Iowa (Jan. 12, 2024) \u2013 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig commented today on the 2023 Iowa Crop Production Annual Summary released by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. The national summary and state summaries are released in January each year. \u00a0\n\u201cEven with all the weather challenges last year, Iowa remained a production powerhouse and that\u2019s a testament to the assistance of timely rains, the resiliency of Iowa farmers, and continuous improvements in genetics, traits, equipment, technology, production methods and many other innovations,\u201d said Secretary Naig.\u00a0\nDespite 2023 ending as the state\u2019s 22nd driest year on record, with 8 of the 12 months registering below normal precipitation and persistent drought continuing for a record 184 consecutive weeks and counting, Iowans once again produced a historically strong corn and soybean crop.2023 Iowa crop production highlights include:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 201 bushels per acre and 2.52 billion bushels of production, this year\u2019s Iowa corn crop ranks as the 4th highest yield and 5th largest production in state history and helped drive the national corn yield and production to all-time record levels.\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 58 bushels per acre and 573 million bushels of production, this year\u2019s soybean crop ranked as the 4th highest yield and 3rd highest production in Iowa history, contributing to the country\u2019s 4th highest yield and 7th largest soybean crop ever.Strong production requires continual efforts to build markets and promote conservation, both of which are top priorities for Secretary Naig and the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\u201cAs Iowa remains a pacesetter in innovation and crop production,\u00a0I'll continue to focus on protecting our essential natural resources like soil and water, and creating new markets and expanding existing markets locally, domestically and internationally,\u201d said Secretary Naig.Iowa Crop ProductionCorn for grain production in Iowa for 2023 was estimated at 2.52 billion bushels, according to the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service \u2013 Crop Production 2023 Summary. Current year production was up 2 percent from the previous year's 2.47 billion bushels. Iowa's corn for grain yield was estimated at 201.0 bushels per acre. Area harvested for grain was estimated at 12.6 million acres, 200,000 acres above 2022. Corn planted for all purposes in 2023 was estimated at 13.1 million acres.Corn for silage production was estimated at 7.60 million tons, down 7 percent from 2022. The silage yield estimate of 20.0 tons per acre was down 1.0 tons per acre from 2022. Producers harvested 380,000 acres of corn for silage, down 3 percent from 2022.Soybean production was estimated at 573 million bushels in 2023. This was down 2 percent from last year's 587 million bushels. The Iowa soybean crop yielded 58.0 bushels per acre in 2023. The harvested acreage of 9.88 million was down 150,000 acres from 2022. Soybean planted acreage, at 9.95 million, was down 150,000 acres from 2022.All hay production for the state was estimated at 2.95 million tons, down 18 percent from the 3.58 million tons produced in 2022. Producers averaged 2.92 tons per acre, down 0.14 tons per acre from 2022. All hay harvested acres were estimated at 1.01 million acres, down 160,000 acres from 2022.Alfalfa and alfalfa mixtures for hay production was estimated at 2.40 million tons, down 11 percent from 2022. Producers averaged 3.20 tons per acre, down 0.50 tons per acre from 2022. Harvested acres were up 20,000 from last year, to 750,000 acres. Iowa producers seeded 70,000 acres of alfalfa and alfalfa mixtures in 2023, down 7 percent from 2022.Other hay production was estimated at 546,000 tons, down 38 percent from 2022. Producers averaged 2.10 tons per acre, up 0.10 tons from the 2022 yield. Harvested acres of other hay, at 260,000, were down 180,000 acres from 2022.United States Crop ProductionCorn for grain production in 2023 was estimated at a record high 15.3 billion bushels, up 12 percent from the 2022 estimate. The average yield in the United States was estimated at a record high 177.3 bushels per acre, 3.9 bushels above the 2022 yield of 173.4 bushels per acre. Area harvested for grain was estimated at 86.5 million acres, up 10 percent from the 2022 estimate.Soybean production in 2023 totaled 4.16 billion bushels, down 2 percent from 2022. The average yield per acre was estimated at 50.6 bushels, up 1.0 bushel from 2022. Harvested area, at 82.4 million acres, was down 4 percent from last year.The complete report can be found on the USDA NASS website at www.nass.usda.gov/Publications.\u00a0\n###\nLed by Secretary Mike Naig, the Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship serves the rural and urban residents that call Iowa home.

      "\nMain Menu\nBreadcrumb\nU.S. climate outlook for September 2024\nAfter a very hot early and middle part of summer, August provided a welcome relief across much of the nation, with much-above-normal temperatures largely confined to the Deep South. The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer.\nSummer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August.\nAs we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here\u2019s the outlook from NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September.\nThe U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September.\u00a0Much warmer\u00a0or\u00a0much cooler than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nOn August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above average temperatures across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above average precipitation along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest.\nThe precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September.\u00a0Much higher\u00a0or\u00a0much lower than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nIn addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I\u2019ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here\u2019s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the most likely outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found here.\nThe updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC\u2019s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With the expected arrival of La Ni\u00f1a somewhat delayed, it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry) can influence temperatures and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks.\nTemperature outlook favors more heat in the West, uncertainty in much of the East\nThe September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. (Well above average means \u201cin the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.\u201d) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with equal chance odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions.\nThe best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is \u201cequal chances\u201d along the coast.\nIt\u2019s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so \u201cequal chances\u201d is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month.\nPrecipitation outlook tilts wet in across the South, mainly dry across the North\nThe precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-\u201cequal chances\u201d forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough.\nBelow-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods.\nU. S. Drought area increases further during August\nThe amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing extreme and exceptional drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards.\nThe summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our\u00a0Data Snapshots Collection,\u00a0based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project.\u00a0\nRegionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north.\nDrought outlook mainly predicts persistence and development, but improvement across parts of the South\nU.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See\u00a0CPC version\u00a0for Alaska and Hawaii.\nWith above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.\nTo read the entire discussion of the monthly climate outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center, check out their\u00a0website.\nWe value your feedback\nHelp us improve our content\nRelated Content\nNEWS & FEATURES\nMAPS & DATA\nTEACHING CLIMATE\nCLIMATE RESILIENCE TOOLKIT\nStay Connected\n",

The national summary and state summaries are released in January each year. \u00a0\n\u201cEven with all the weather challenges last year, Iowa remained a production powerhouse and that\u2019s a testament to the assistance of timely rains, the resiliency of Iowa farmers, and continuous improvements in genetics, traits, equipment, technology, production methods and many other innovations,\u201d said Secretary Naig.\u00a0\nDespite 2023 ending as the state\u2019s 22nd driest year on record, with 8 of the 12 months registering below normal precipitation and persistent drought continuing for a record 184 consecutive weeks and counting, Iowans once again produced a historically strong corn and soybean crop.2023 Iowa crop production highlights include:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 201 bushels per acre and 2.52 billion bushels of production, this year\u2019s Iowa corn crop ranks as the 4th highest yield and 5th largest production in state history and helped drive the national corn yield and production to all-time record levels.\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 58 bushels per acre and 573 million bushels of production, this year\u2019s soybean crop ranked as the 4th highest yield and 3rd highest production in Iowa history, contributing to the country\u2019s 4th highest yield and 7th largest soybean crop ever.Strong production requires continual efforts to build markets and promote conservation, both of which are top priorities for Secretary Naig and the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\u201cAs Iowa remains a pacesetter in innovation and crop production,\u00a0I'll continue to focus on protecting our essential natural resources like soil and water, and creating new markets and expanding existing markets locally, domestically and internationally,\u201d said Secretary Naig.Iowa Crop ProductionCorn for grain production in Iowa for 2023 was estimated at 2.52 billion bushels, according to the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service \u2013 Crop Production 2023 Summary.

Corn is no exception and to ensure a future supply we must begin to understand how climate impacts both the phenological development of corn and the productivity. Temperature and precipitation are the two climate factors that will have a major benefit on corn phenology and productivity. The warming climate will accelerate the phenological development because the number of thermal units required for leaf appearance is relatively constant in the vegetative stage. Productivity of corn is reduced when extreme temperature events occur during pollination and is further exaggerated when there are water deficits at pollination. During the grain-filling period, warm temperatures above the upper threshold cause a reduction in yield. Model estimates suggest that for every 1\u00b0C increase in temperature there is nearly a 10% yield reduction. To meet world demand, new adaptation practices are needed to provide water to the growing crop and avoid extreme temperature events during the growing season. Climate change will continue to affect corn production and understanding these effects will help determine where future production areas exist and innovative adaptation practices to benefit yield stability could be utilized.\nKeywords\nAuthor Information\n*Address all correspondence to: jerry.hatfield@ars.usda.gov\n1. Introduction\nCorn (Zea mays L.) is grown throughout the world and as such is subject to a wide variety of climates and potential scenarios of climate change. Production area continues to increase in response to the increased demand for corn grain and the production per unit area (yield) has continued to increase due to enhanced technology (Figure 1). What is imperative to stability and increases in future production is understanding how climate change will impact this trend in corn production and the areas of the world where corn is produced. Corn is a grain crop with both food and feed uses and variation in production at the local scale can have major impact on local economies and local food supplies as well as world food security.\nWorld corn yield and area harvested since 1960 (data obtained from FAO stat, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en, downloaded March 8, 2018).\nWorld corn yield and area harvested since 1960 (data obtained from FAO stat, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en, downloaded March 8, 2018).\nThe trend line for corn yield has shown a steady increase and a small amount of variation among the years; however, at the local scale is where the impacts of seasonal weather and trends in climate become more noticeable. Across the United States, there have been large deviations from the trend line in years in which weather events have caused yield reductions (Figure 2). Throughout this chapter, we will focus on the impacts of climate on corn phenology and production to provide an understanding of the potential for adaptation strategies. In this chapter we will focus on three components critical to corn production: the changing climate, impact of climate on corn phenology and phenological models, and impact of climate on corn productivity.\nDeviations from the yield trend line for corn production in the United States from 1950 to 2017.

Projections of climate change\nProjections of climate change are a result of a combined set of simulation models using various scenarios of changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and the associated forcing functions [1]. The current CO2 concentrations are at nearly 400\u00a0ppm in 2018 and are projected to increase to a range of 794\u20131142\u00a0ppm by 2100 without any abatement scenarios [1]. The result of these efforts can be summarized as [1, 2]:Global mean temperatures will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century if CO2 concentrations continue to increase and under the highest emission scenario would range from 2.6 to 4.8\u00b0C.These temperatures changes will not be uniform across regions with increases over land surfaces being larger than over the oceans.As the global temperatures increase there will be more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes at both daily and seasonal time scales.Precipitation will increase with increases in global mean surface temperature and could increase 1 to 3% \u00b0C\u22121; however, there will be substantial spatial variation in these changes.The water holding capacity of air increases by 7% \u00b0C\u22121. The air can take up more water, and water vapor inclines. That leads to higher intensity of precipitation, i.e. higher amount of rainfall per rain event.Annual surface evaporation will increase as the temperatures increases; however, over land, evaporation will be linked to precipitation.\nGlobal mean temperatures will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century if CO2 concentrations continue to increase and under the highest emission scenario would range from 2.6 to 4.8\u00b0C.\nThese temperatures changes will not be uniform across regions with increases over land surfaces being larger than over the oceans.\nAs the global temperatures increase there will be more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes at both daily and seasonal time scales.\nPrecipitation will increase with increases in global mean surface temperature and could increase 1 to 3% \u00b0C\u22121; however, there will be substantial spatial variation in these changes.\nThe water holding capacity of air increases by 7% \u00b0C\u22121.

A general summary of climate impacts on crops was prepared by Hatfield et al. [3] and reveal for corn that temperature and precipitation are the two critical factors. Since corn is a C4 plant, the response to increasing CO2 will be minimal. Leakey et al. [4] found that leaf photosynthetic response was 3% to a doubling of CO2 concentrations while total biomass and grain yield increased by 4%. They did observe that leaf stomatal conductance was decreased by 34% under these same experiments. These differences in physiological activity due to increased CO2 are small compared to C3 species and will not the most evident response to the changing climate. Therefore, in this chapter we will focus on temperature and precipitation impacts on corn.\n3. Phenology of corn\nThe phenology of corn has been described as the appearance of leaves or leaf collars during the vegetative stage and accumulation of material in the grain during the reproductive stage. The developmental stages of corn has been recently described by Abendroth et al. [5] and similar guidelines are used to quantify the phenological stage of corn during the growth cycle. What is important for assessing the effect of climate on corn is to explore what role climate variables have on corn phenology. The most critical variable in phenological development is temperature and each plant has a specific range of temperatures for growth as defined as the upper and lower limit (threshold) and an optimum [3]. For corn during the vegetative stage this has been identified as 8 to 38\u00b0C with an optimum of 34\u00b0C [6, 7] while the range for the reproductive stage is 8\u201330\u00b0C [8]. Typically, the lower temperature limit in growth models has assumed to be 10\u00b0C. Survival of pollen are sensitive to temperature, e.g., temperatures exceeding 35\u00b0C have been proven detrimental to pollen viability [9, 10]. There is a strong interaction of temperature with vapor pressure deficit and the viability in the time of movement from the tassel to the silk has been shown to decrease with decreasing moisture content [11]. These results would suggest that as the temperature increases and vapor pressure deficit increases that disruption of the pollination process could become more likely especially with the potential for more extreme temperature events. Quantifying the impact of episodes of temperature extremes on pollen viability and the disruption of reproductive processes will become more important with the projection that extreme temperature events will increase under climate change (Tebabldi et al. [12]). These temperature ranges and the potential for extreme events will become important for corn growth and production because of the projection that temperatures will increase in the future.\nThe relationship of corn phenology to temperature has been described through the use of growing degree days with a growing degree day (GDD) calculated as (Tmax\u00a0+\u00a0Tmin)/2 \u2013 Tbase, where Tmax is the maximum daily temperature, Tmin is the daily minimum temperature and Tbase is the temperature at which growth stops. Kumudini et al. [13] evaluated eight different thermal models for the estimation of corn phenological development. These thermal models were classified into empirical linear typical of the GDD model first shown by Gilmore and Rogers [14] with the most robust model having a Tbase of 10\u00b0C and an optimum of 30\u00b0C. Another class of thermal models is the empirical nonlinear model described by Brown and Bootsma [15] where the following relationships were used to estimate crop heat units (CHU): if Tmin\u00a0<\u00a04.4\u00b0C then Tmin\u00a0=\u00a04.4\u00b0C to derive CHUmin\u00a0=\u00a01.8(Tmin \u2013 4.4\u00b0C); if Tmax\u00a0<\u00a010\u00b0C then Tmax\u00a0=\u00a010\u00b0C; to derive CHUmax\u00a0=\u00a03.33(Tmax \u2013 10\u00b0C) \u2013 0.084(Tmax \u2013 10\u00b0C)2 and CHU\u00a0= (CHUmax\u00a0+\u00a0CHUmin)/2. Stewart et al. [16] used a non-linear empirical model and separated the vegetative and reproductive stages of growth with different functions. The third class of thermal models can be classified as the process-based models similar to the thermal functions used in Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) as described by Wilson et al. [17] which are based on estimates of air temperature at 3 hour intervals throughout the day and given as: if T\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b0C then T\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0C and if T\u00a0>\u00a044\u00b0C then T\u00a0=\u00a044\u00b0C and calculated for different temperature ranges as 0\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a010\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a0T(10/18\u00b0C); 18\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a034\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a0T \u2013 8\u00b0C; and 34\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a044\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a026\u00b0C \u2013 (T \u2013 34\u00b0C)2.6 and thermal units are given as \u2211(IR/8), where IR\u00a0=\u00a0instantaneous rates or measurements. In comparing these different approaches, Kumudini et al. [13] found that the precision in terms of goodness of fit was calendar days < empirical linear < process-based < empirical non-linear.\nAn application of the GDD approach was developed by Neild and Richman [18] where they combined thermal units with precipitation in an agroclimatic index to determine where different corn hybrids could be grown around the world. Currently, this type of model has been replaced with simulation models similar to APSIM [19] to determine climate impacts on corn growth and production. If the thermal units per leaf appearance rate is constant for the vegetative stage of growth then as the temperature increases there will be a more rapid accumulation of leaves in the crop. This effect as observed by Hatfield [20] and Hatfield and Prueger [21] for corn grown under climatic normal (1980\u20132010) for Ames, Iowa and normal +4\u00b0C temperatures throughout the complete growing season for three different corn hybrids. There was no difference in the total number of leaf collars and cumulative leaf area between temperature regimes; however, there was a large difference in yield with the higher temperatures greatly reducing grain yield (Figure 4). Analysis revealed there was no difference in the GDD\u2019s for leaf collar appearance between the two temperature regimes suggesting that as temperatures increase there will be a more rapid rate of advancement in the phenological development with no effect on the size of the corn plant at the end of the vegetative stage. There was a large difference in grain yield between temperature regimes with a faster rate of maturity with a subsequent reduction in grain production.\nDifferences in total leaf collars, cumulative leaf area, and grain yield of three corn hybrids grown under normal Ames, Iowa temperatures and normal +4\u00b0C temperatures.

Effects of increased temperatures have shown a large degree of variation with projections of reduced production by less than 5% with temperature increases of 1\u00b0C [3] to over 50% with 4\u00b0C increases [22]. Productivity of corn is affected by temperatures exceeding 35\u00b0 C during pollination due to dehydration of the pollen [3]. Controlled environment studies have confirmed the effect of high temperatures on corn with temperatures greater than or equal to 3\u00b0C above normal temperatures showing maize yield reductions of over 50% in grain yield [20, 21]. They observed an increased rate of phenology with increased temperatures; however, the largest effect on productivity was attributed to the increase in minimum temperatures during the grain-filling period. Field studies on corn have shown under field conditions yield reductions from 13 to 88% due to increased temperature 6\u00b0C above normal temperatures [23]. The negative effects of high temperatures during the grain-filling period were attributed to pollen survivability and the efficiency of the grain-filling process. Increasing temperatures likely to be experienced under climate change demonstrate several negative effects plant growth and phenology. Lizaso et al. [24] recorded a reduction of corn yield under field and controlled conditions owing to reduced pollen viability as impacted by increased temperatures. A critical knowledge gap under future climate scenarios will be to evaluate the interaction of high temperature and increased humidity on pollen survivability and the efficiency of the pollination process. Lobell and Field [25] found maize yields decreased 8.3% per 1\u00b0C rise without any additional effect due to water stress which was confirmed by Mishra and Cherkauer [26] for Midwest corn grain yields. Challinor et al. [27] compiled a meta-analysis of over 1700 published simulations for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and corn. They found that without implementing adaptation strategies there would be a loss in yield in both temperate and tropical regions with only 2\u00b0C of warming. They also found that adaptation practices could increase simulated yields by 7\u201315% with this same temperature increase; however, the practices were more effective in wheat and rice than for corn. There was consensus among the simulation models that yield decreases were be greater in the second half of the century with the greater declines in the tropical areas compared to the temperate regions. They estimated that corn yields would decrease by nearly 15% in temperate regions with a 4\u00b0C increase and no adaptation but showed no decrease with adaptation practices [27].\nTemperature and precipitation interact to affect corn productivity. Short-term water deficits and drought reduce growth and grain yield and are often the largest cause of crop losses. In the United States, drought was related to 41% of crop losses, while excess water was attributed to 16% of the yield loss [28]. Drought stress during the early and middle reproductive stages affected grain yields and these phenological stages were found to be the most sensitive to water stress [29]. Increases in spring precipitation can cause yield reductions due to aeration stress caused by flooded soils; however, drought stress remained the primary factor linked with reduced grain production [29]. In rainfed environments where corn is primarily grown, temperature and precipitation changes under climate change will negatively impact grain production and these interactions need to be more fully understood. In an analysis of wheat production in Europe, Semenov et al. [30], stated that understanding of the effects of higher temperatures and drought stresses during the booting and flowering periods would potentially lead to adaptation practices with the potential to reduce losses in grain numbers and grain weight. With both short-term water stress and drought as major factors affecting grain yield, improved water availability through more extensive root system and changes in root architecture would benefit yield stability [31]. The excess soil moisture in the root zone will require improved soil structure to facilitate gas exchange between the root system and the atmosphere [32]. The impact of precipitation is a combination of the precipitation amount and the soil water holding capacity. This was illustrated in an analysis by Egli and Hatfield [33] where they found average county level corn yields were a function of the soils ability to supply water.\nEvaluation of corn yield response to climate is complex because of the interactions of the impacts of temperature and precipitation. To provide a more robust framework for evaluating yield response the utilization of the yield gap as the difference between potential yield and actual yield has been utilized ([34]; van Bussel et al. [35]). This concept has been discussed and utilized for several decades but recently has been extended to create a yield gap atlas for the world. The yield gap approach allows for a quantitative assessment of the ability of the crop to achieve its potential yield and the inability of closing the yield gap can often be ascribed to climatic stress. Potential yield has been defined as \u201cthe yield of a cultivar when grown in environments to which it is adapted; with nutrients and water not limiting; and with pests, diseases, weeds, and other stresses effectively controlled\u201d [36]. Potential yield (YP) is an expression of the ability of a crop canopy to convert solar radiation into dry matter with no stress during the growth cycle and radiation use efficiency can be used as a measure of this efficiency [37]. The goal of agronomic science is the evaluate practices and increasing the farmer yield (YF) may prove to be more fruitful than increasing potential yield (YP) ([38]; Lobell et al. [39]. Utilizing the yield gap approach provides a framework for evaluating the factors which affect crop yields and the phenological stage which these factors are having the most significant impact during the growing season. These studies are not simple analyses, because of the interactions of multiple factors affecting yield, and Sinclair and Ruffy [40] argue that nitrogen and water limit crop yield more than plant genetics and should be considered as the primary factors limiting yield. Understanding the yield gap requires being able to quantify both potential and actual yield and comparison among studies is often limited by the lack of consistent data and to advance our understanding of yield gaps will require standardized method for yield comparisons [41]. Fischer et al. [41] introduced attainable yield (YA) as a metric between YF and YP defined as the yield achieved by a producer under near optimum weather and management inputs. Hatfield et al. [42] utilized this approach on county level corn yields in the Midwest United States and defined the attainable yield as the years with the highest yield in the long-term record as illustrated in Figure 5. The values for attainable yield are derived by statistically fitting a line through the frontier of the yield observations and then computing the yield gap as the difference between the attainable and actual observed yield for each year. In this analysis, data from 1950 through the present are used because this represents the period of time with corn hybrids and enhanced production technology. This approach has been used for different crops and regions of the world to obtain yield gaps.\nYield gap analysis for Story County, Iowa, USA using attainable yields derived from annual production values.

(data obtained from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, www.nass.usda.gov, accessed March 8, 2018).\nHatfield et al. [42] utilized the yield gap approach for the Midwestern US to quantify the effects of climate variability on corn production and found three dominant climatic factors related to the yield gap. These were July maximum temperatures, August minimum temperatures, and July\u2013August total precipitation. Yield gaps increased when July maximum temperatures exceeded 32\u00b0C, August minimum temperatures exceeded 20\u00b0C, and July\u2013August precipitation totals decreased below 150\u00a0mm. The physiological reasons for these variables are related to the disruption of pollination (July temperatures), increased rate of senescence and reduced efficiency of grain-fill (August minimum temperatures), and water deficits during a period of the year with high crop water requirements (July\u2013August precipitation). These relationships were observed for each county in the Midwest and utilized to project the impact of future climate change on the yield gap on corn production. They found that with the trends in temperature for the summer in the Midwest US that yield gaps would exceed 50% by the year 2075 in the southern portion of the Corn Belt. There were some counties in the Midwest in which excess moisture in the spring was related to the yield gap but these relationships were not robust enough for use in projections of future climates. The yield gap framework provides a robust method for assessing the impact of climate on yield variation over time and when combined with efforts similar to those used by Challinor et al. [27] could be used to quantify the impact of adaptation practices.\n5. Agroclimatic indices to define corn production regions\nCorn is produced around the world and within these areas there may be shifts in production areas due to the changing climate. Green et al. [43] have quantified the changes in the US Corn Belt and provided a geographic analysis to depict these shifts in distribution. Development and utilization of agroclimatic indices has value in being able to assess these shifts because they are related to temperature and precipitation. Neild and Richman [18] were among the first to use the GDD concept to define potential differences among corn hybrids. Development of tools to define where crops can be produced is critical to understand crop distribution and productivity [44]. Estimation of crop distribution within arable areas is necessary to determine whether a species can thrive in an agroclimatic zone and will become more critical with the projected increases in temperature. Zomer et al. [45] extended this concept to demonstrate how climate zones could be used to evaluate technologies that would enhance the ability of management practices to offset the impacts of climate change on crop production. There have continued to be advances in the development of agroclimatic indices to evaluate the suitability of a location for a particular crop since Neild and Richman [18]. Siddons et al. [46] cautioned that development of robust agroclimatic indices requires observations collected over long time periods and extensive observations from experimental locations. There has been an evolution in agroclimatic indices to include more factors affecting plant growth and development to derive values that characterize the environment and the potential for crop production. Typical factors are: average daily minimum temperatures below 0\u00b0C; daily mean temperature to estimate crop development rates; average daily maximum temperature above 35\u00b0C to estimate exposure to heat stress, especially during pollination; average daily soil water availability (precipitation\u2013reference evapotranspiration (ET)); and length of specific phenological periods to estimate the effects of changing phenological development on biomass accumulation and crop yield [47]. They found a positive relationship between productivity and their suitability index [47]. This approach is a refinement of the effort by Neild and Richman [18] and incorporated more factors to more link crop physiological responses with phenological development.\nAgroclimatic zones are a combination of factors affecting plant growth to evaluate the potential for grain or forage crop production (e.g., [18, 44, 48?51]). The form of the index depends upon the assumption of the factors limiting growth. Soil water availability is often the determining factor in crop production in all ecosystems and the application has ranged from determination of irrigation water requirements or potential impacts on production caused by water deficits. Daccache et al. [49] incorporated soil water variability to evaluate the need for irrigation for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production in England and Wales. Their index was based on the potential soil moisture deficit (PSMD) index defined as:\nwhere PSMDi is the value in month i and PSMDi\u22121 is the value for the previous month, ETi is the reference ET for the current month calculated with the Penman-Monteith equation formulated by Allen et al. [52], and Pi the precipitation in the current month. They found increased variation in precipitation decreased potato production in an area currently suited for production, unless supplemental water was provide through irrigation. This type of analyses could be utilized to determine the need for supplemental irrigation to ensure crop production.\nAnother form of this type of framework was developed by Moeletsi and Walker [51] to quantify climate risk for corn production in South Africa. They based their index, Poone AgroClimatic Suitability Index (PACSI), on three climatic parameters; onset of rains, frost risk, and drought risk utilized a weighed distribution of climate parameters as\nwhere O is the probability planting conditions are met, FF is the probability of a frost-free growing period, and the water requirements satisfaction index (WRSI). These indices require sufficient data over a long period of record to develop the probability of the different indices to develop reliable probability assessments [46]. An aspect of this index is the assessment of drought risk which is a complex interaction by soil water holding capacity and any change in the soil affecting water availability (Eq. 2).\nPrecipitation effects on crop productivity are defined by the occurrence of the water deficits in the soil profile which fail to meet the evaporative demand. Agroclimatic indices for arid and semiarid regions are often based on precipitation amounts adequate to exceed the ET rate at the time of planting in order to ensure crop establishment [18, 47, 48, 49, 51]. Moeletsi and Walker [51] evaluated soil water dynamics based on the WRSI to determine the potential to meet crop water requirements at any phenological stage as\nwhere WRi is the water requirements for a decadal period during growing season, PETi is the potential ET during this decadal period, and kci the crop coefficient for this corresponding phenological period. For any decadal period during the growing season, the soil water balance can be used to estimate plant available water (WAi) as\nand Preci is the precipitation in a given decadal period and SWi-1 is the profile soil water content for the previous decadal period. Soil water holding capacity (WHC) becomes a critical component of this method because available SW is a function of WHC. They computed the WRSI as\nwith WDi the water deficit for decadal period i, defined as\nOr\nIn this process soil water in the profile is quantified as\nUsing this methodology, Moeletsi and Walker [51] were able to evaluate the suitability for maize production for various planting dates with a correlation of 0.8 between the PACSI and grain yields.\nPrecipitation is changing in intensity and frequency, and directly affect WAi (Eq. 3). Precipitation patterns are projected to increase in annual totals, with decreasing summer precipitation amounts over the US [1, 53]. If we link these precipitation patterns with the PACSI (Eq. 2), then corn production could become more variable among years because of soil water availability.\nUtilization of agroclimatic indices as a tool for the assessment of climate impacts on corn production areas will provide a quantitative view of shifts in production areas but potential risks to production within areas where corn is currently produced. The continued development of these tools will benefit corn production because we can evaluate the potential role of management and genetic resources on increasing yield stability over time.\n6. Simulation models to quantify climate effects\nSimulation models have been extensively used to estimate the impact of a changing climate on productivity. In 2014, Challinor et al. [27] summarized 1700 published reports using simulation models and the number of papers has increased rapidly since that time. Simulation models provide the capability of assessing the potential impacts of the change in temperature and precipitation under a given CO2 regime and often models using the different emission scenarios to determine the expected temperature and precipitation parameters which are then placed into crop simulation models [54, 55]. It has been found that an ensemble of crop models provides a more rigorous approach to estimating crop responses to climate. This is being conducted under the Agricultural Model Implementation and Improvement Project (AgMIP) framework as described by Rosenzweig et al. [56]. Bassu et al. [57] used this framework to compare 23 different corn models and found temperature decreased yield by approximately \u22120.5\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121\u00b0C\u22121 while doubling the CO2 from 360 to 720\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0mol\u22121 increased yield by 7.5% across all models and sites. They concluded that temperature increases would be the dominant factor affecting corn yields. Zhao et al. [58] summarized a number of published results and found for each 1\u00b0C increase, corn yields decreased by 7.4%. Jin et al. [59] used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model to evaluate the effect of different CO2 scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for corn production in the US and found drought will be the largest factor affecting production. However, they stated that combined impacts of temperature and water stress need to be evaluated in breeding programs and adaptation strategies [59]. Earlier, Jin et al. [60] evaluated the algorithms in 16 different corn models and concluded that heat and drought stress was best simulated when models used event-based heat and water stress descriptions, accounted for nighttime temperature stresses, and evaluated the interactions of multiple stresses. Crop models allow for an assessment of the role of genetics and management on productivity for a range of present and future environmental conditions. Hatfield and Walthall [31] utilized this concept as the G x E x M (genetics \u00d7 environment \u00d7 management) framework to determine how these interactions would need to be understood to provide food security for the future population growth.\nThere have been efforts to combine observations with crop simulation models to evaluate changes in yield and yield stability. Leng [61] found yield variability across the US Corn Belt has decreased from 1980 to 2010 with climatic variability the major factor affected variability among years and regions. He found that statistical models explained more of the yield variation than crop simulation models. Bhattarai et al. [62] used the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model with the combined results for eight general circulation models to show that under low and medium carbon scenarios, corn yields during the period 2080\u20132099 increased compared to the 2015\u20132034 period, while under the high carbon scenario yields during these same periods decreased. Lychuk et al. [63]) also used EPIC for the southeastern United States and found in the near-term corn yields increased, but from 2066 to 2070 yields decreased 5\u201313% because of the increased temperature stress. Huang et al. [64] combined field experiments with crop simulation models to evaluate the potential effect of different growing season length corn hybrids and found the longer growing season hybrid did not yield as high as the medium length hybrid. These results suggest that efforts be placed in evaluating the efficiency of plant growth relative to the changes in temperature and the accumulation of growing degree days.\nThe Global Agro-ecological zones model (GAEZ) categorizes areas suitable for crop production by climate, soil, terrain, management, and the specific growth limitations of crops, among others [65, 66]. One essential concept of GAEZ climate module is the temperature growing period (LGPt), where air temperature is used as a proxy to estimate days of the growing period with optimal, sub-optimal, and no suitable crop production conditions for a specific crop. The growing period L is defined as the number of days with average daily temperature\u00a0>\u00a05\u00b0C (i.e., LGPt5). The corn-specific LGPt\u2019s are summarized in Table 1. For example, assume a temperate corn cultivar for grain production with a total growing period between 90 and 180\u00a0days. During this period average daily air temperature shall not decrease below 5\u00b0C, and the number of days with daily average air temperature between 10 and 15\u00b0C shall be below \u215f5 of the total growing period to reach optimum growing conditions. In addition to air temperature, the length of the growing period is further limited by the moisture regime, defined as actual ET\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.5 * reference ET.\nTable 1.\nCorn growing period L (LGPt5), optimum, and sub-optimum conditions of tropical lowland, tropical highland, and subtropical and temperature cultivars for grain production, as well as subtropical and temperate cultivars for silage production.\nAdapted and simplified from [66]\nThe GAEZ model also estimates potential yield of a specific crop in a specific agro-ecological zone, and applies constraint factors, such as heat or water stress, to calculate actual yield and yield gap. For example, periods of potential water stress occur when actual ET is below the total water requirement of a crop, maximum ET, and the difference between both cannot be compensated by precipitation, plant available water, or irrigation. Maximum ET is calculated as reference ET multiplied by crop coefficient kc. Maximum ET is crop specific and changes during crop development by applying crop-development specific kc values (Figure 6). The derived water stress data is then used to calculate yield constraining factors. The GAEZ model also determines which production areas are threatened by climatic changes by applying different climatic scenarios. Using this approach, Teixeira et al. [67] estimated that 5 Mha of cropland suitable for corn production are at risk due to climate change induced heat stress, and that yield declines are expected especially in the Northern hemisphere between 40 and 60\u00b0N latitudes.\nCrop development specific kc values for corn: kc1, kc2, kc3, and kc4 applies for the initial (d1), vegetative (d2), reproductive (d3), and maturation (d4) development period, respectively. Crop coefficient kc5 applies to the end of the growing period. Corn kc2 and kc4 data are linearly interpolated between kc1, kc3, and kc5. The four corn development stages make up 15, 30, 35, and 20% of the total growing period. Data, equations, and redrawn graph according to IIASA/FAO [66]. In this example, total growing period (day of planting until harvest) was 173\u00a0days, for two corn fields nearby Ames, IA, USA from 2006 to 2017.\nCrop development specific kc values for corn: kc1, kc2, kc3, and kc4 applies for the initial (d1), vegetative (d2), reproductive (d3), and maturation (d4) development period, respectively.

In this example, total growing period (day of planting until harvest) was 173\u00a0days, for two corn fields nearby Ames, IA, USA from 2006 to 2017.\nOne of the large challenges and opportunities for simulation models will be to incorporate the expected changes in insect and disease populations affecting corn production and link this with the production models. Integration of these two aspects into a single framework will allow for a more complete assessment of the corn production system being experienced by producers.\n7. Conclusions\nClimate impacts on corn production due to the changing temperature and precipitation regimes in the corn growing areas. The largest impact of these changes will be at the local scale where within season weather induced by the change in climate will become more noticeable. Increasing temperatures will increase the rate of phenological development during the vegetative and reproductive stages; however, the most negative effects will be exposure to high temperatures during the pollination and grain-filling stages. The largest impact on corn production will remain linked to the availability of soil water through precipitation and variation in precipitation during the grain-filling period will have the most detrimental impact on corn production. To overcome the effects of climate change there will be shifts in areas where corn is produced; however, these shifts may not be into areas with the capacity of the soil to support high production or have large variation in yield among years due to the variation in within season weather [33]. What will be critical is to increase our understanding of the G \u00d7 E \u00d7 M interactions as suggested by Hatfield and Walthall [31] in order to reduce the risk in production from a changing climate. What will be critical will be to use our current knowledge base (i.e. genetic resources (G) and management techniques (M)) to determine the viability of potential adaptation strategies to overcome climate changes (E). Combining experimental studies with crop simulation models will advance our understanding of the complex interactions occurring between the biological system and the physical environment and guide us toward viable adaptation practices with the potential to offset the negative impacts of climate change.\nReferences\nSections\nCite this chapter\nThere are two ways to cite this chapter:\nNext chapter\nBy Amanullah and Shah Fahad\n1,343 downloads  | 4 cites\nWritten By\nSubmitted: 06 February 2018 Reviewed: 02 April 2018 Published: 10 October 2018\nCite this chapter\nThere are two ways to cite this chapter:\n\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).

      "How Many Polar Bears Are Left?\nSeveral populations likely face grave danger from climate change\nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n The global polar bear population is thought to be between 22,000 and 31,000. These bears are divided into 19 subpopulations around the Arctic, with some containing fewer than 200 individuals and others consisting of more than 2,000.\n\n Polar bears' rapidly dwindling populations serve as a symbol of the climate crisis globally, but are they technically endangered? Their conservation status may surprise you. Learn more about polar bear populations, the threats these animals face, and what we can do to save them from extinction.\n\nDid You Know?\nPolar bears live in areas that fall under the jurisdiction of five countries: Canada (Labrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, Yukon); Denmark (Greenland); Norway (Svalbard, Jan Mayen); Russia (Yakutiya, Krasnoyarsk, West Siberia, North European Russia); and the U.S. (Alaska).\n  Are Polar Bears Endangered?  \nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n Polar bears are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, a designation they first received in 1982 and that was upheld by the latest assessment in 2015. They are protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, a multilateral treaty signed in 1973 by the five polar bear nations: Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the U.S. This agreement prohibits unregulated hunting of polar bears, including the use of aircraft or large motorized vehicles to hunt them. It compels member states to take appropriate actions to preserve the ecosystems that sustain polar bears.\n\n Although not technically endangered, the U.S. government has protected them under the Endangered Species Act since 2008, classifying them as threatened throughout their range. It's important to note that while these bears face potentially existential threats in some places, a few populations have rebounded in recent decades from overhunting in the last century, leading some people to argue polar bears are actually thriving.\n\n The late U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska was one of those people, saying in 2018 that \"there are now three times as many polar bears in the Arctic than there were in the 1970s,\" a claim that has periodically resurfaced since. According to the IUCN, it's not clear which way polar bear populations are swinging on the whole. World Wildlife Fund data from 2019 shows that more subpopulations are declining than are increasing. The largest subpopulations look to be stable.\n\nLaws Protecting Polar Bears\nCountries with polar bear populations have passed laws enacting various protections for the bears. In the U.S., polar bears are protected partly by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which prohibits the \"take\" of polar bears and other marine mammals without federal approval. They are also protected by the Endangered Species Act since being listed as a \"threatened\" species in 2008.\n  Limitations to the Data  \n Despite the encouraging rebound of some populations, there is little evidence to suggest polar bears are thriving overall. That's partly because there isn't enough long-term data on polar bears, especially for the northernmost regions.\n\n Those who doubt their current plight have claimed that only 5,000 polar bears were left in the 1960s, but that claim is largely contested by conservation experts.\n\n At least three polar bear populations are likely in decline, according to the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), but nine of the 19 subpopulations have insufficient data. There is too little data to even estimate population size for the three in decline.\n\n While their specific status is more muddled than the overall outlook for climate change itself, there is significant evidence to suggest many polar bear populations are in peril.\n\n  How Is Climate Change Affecting Polar Bear Populations?  \nFloridaStock / Shutterstock\n To understand why polar bears are threatened by climate change, you have to consider what polar bears eat and how they get their food. Polar bears are apex predators and a keystone species in their Arctic habitats, and their favorite food, by far, is seals. They specifically target ringed and bearded seals due to their high-fat content.\n\n Polar bears spend about half their time hunting, typically by stalking seals from the sea ice and ambushing when they surface to breathe. They often travel long distances and wait hours or days for a single seal, and while only a fraction of their hunts succeed, it's generally worth the trouble for such a fatty meal.\n\n Polar bears are considered marine mammals, but while they are excellent swimmers, they are no match for a seal in the water. Sea ice is therefore instrumental to their hunting strategy, and it's now declining due to rising Arctic temperatures, now warming at roughly twice the rate of the planet overall.\n\nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n Arctic sea ice naturally waxes and wanes with the seasons, but its average late-summer minimum is now shrinking by 13% every decade, according to the NOAA. The oldest Arctic sea ice\u2014frozen for at least four years, making it more resilient than younger, thinner ice\u2014is now in steep decline. Whereas it comprised about 16% of the total ice pack in 1985, it now comprises less than 1%, representing a loss of 95% over just 33 years.\n\n In 2020, Arctic sea ice reached its second-lowest extent since record-keeping began. This decline is alarming for several reasons: Arctic sea ice performs key services for the planet like reflecting solar heat and influencing ocean currents. It's even more directly important for polar bears, as less sea ice means fewer chances for them to catch seals.\n\nPosnov / Getty Images\n The effects of climate change vary by location, and sea ice decline seems to be affecting some bears more than others. Western Hudson Bay had roughly 1,200 polar bears in the 1980s, for example, but that has since fallen to 842, and as Polar Bears International (PBI) notes, trends in their body condition, survival, and abundance have been linked to sea ice conditions. Bears in Southern Hudson Bay have also suffered a 17% decline since 2012, according to PBI, and their body conditions have similarly been linked to a longer ice-free period.\n\n Most other subpopulations are either considered stable or lack sufficient data, but many will likely also face dire challenges from the loss of sea ice in their habitats. Some might be able to adapt, but their options likely will be limited. Even if they can exploit new food sources on land, they could face competition or conflict with established residents like brown bears and people.\n\n Polar bears are slow to adapt due to their low reproductive rate and long time between generations. That doesn't bode well given the speed of modern climate change, already happening too quickly for many species to keep up.\n\nPolar bears can live up to about 30 years, but environmental factors (melting Arctic ice, for example) can significantly decrease their lifespans.\nPolar bears are apex predators and a keystone species in the Arctic. Without them, animals like Arctic foxes and seagulls would lose a food source. Seals, reindeer, whales, and birds that polar bears eat would become overpopulated.\nThe best way to help polar bear populations today is to fight climate change\u2014both systematically and in your own life. Drive less, reduce your energy consumption, recycle, and swap some of your meat intake with locally grown veggies. If you have the means, consider donating to a charity like Polar Bears International.\n\"Polar Bear Facts.\" World Wildlife Fund.\nWiig, \u00d8., et al.\u00a0\"Ursus maritimus.\"\u00a0The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\u00a02015: e.T22823A14871490.\u00a0Accessed on\u00a015 June 2022.\n\"Arctic Report Card.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Program. 2021.\n\"Climate Change: Arctic Sea Ice Summer Minimum.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 2020.\n\"Arctic Report Card.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Program. 2018.\n\"Arctic Sea Ice Extent.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\"Are Polar Bears Endangered?\" Polar Bears International.\nObbard, Martyn Ernest, et al. \"Estimating the abundance of the Southern Hudson Bay polar bear subpopulation with aerial surveys.\" Polar Biology. 2015.\nFollow Us\n",

In addition, approximately 300 polar bears are held in captivity. However, the world's population of polar bears is on a decline, and some scientists fear they could become extinct by 2100. To protect these majestic creatures, the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing polar bears.\nA significant portion of the polar bear population resides in Canada, where two-thirds of all polar bears live. About 16,000 polar bears are spread across 13 provinces and territories, including Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Notably, Churchill, Manitoba, is known as the polar bear capital of the world due to its high concentration of these animals.\nIn the United States, Alaska is the only state with a polar bear population, estimated to be between 4,000 and 7,000 individuals. The polar bears in Alaska are primarily divided into two subpopulations: those in the Chukchi Sea, or Alaska-Chukotka, and the Southern Beaufort Sea.\nRussia is home to an estimated 26,000 polar bears, living on islands and the mainland coast. Wrangel Island, a UNESCO-protected nature reserve in Russia, is often referred to as a polar bear maternity ward. Additional polar bear populations in Russia are found in the Barents Sea region, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and the Far East Village.\nGreenland's fjords and glacial ice are also home to polar bears, though they are elusive and rarely seen. It's estimated that around 4,400 polar bears inhabit Greenland, with two protected areas, Melville Bay and Greenland National Park, supporting polar bear populations.\nThe Svalbard archipelago in Norway is another prime location for spotting polar bears, with an estimated population of around 3,000. Despite their remote habitats, polar bear encounters can sometimes be dangerous. Since the 1970s, there have been six recorded human fatalities due to polar bear attacks.\nMost polar bears in captivity are found in zoos, aquariums, and parks across Europe, North America, and Asia, contributing to conservation and education efforts about these iconic Arctic inhabitants.\n\nThe global polar bear population is estimated to be 20000-25000 individuals as of 2023, shared between all countries included in the species' range: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States, as well as in international polar regions.\nPolar bears often roam from one country's territory into another, particularly in the winter when the polar ice reaches its broadest spread. As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This Page"

In addition, approximately 300 polar bears are held in captivity. However, the world's population of polar bears is on a decline, and some scientists fear they could become extinct by 2100. To protect these majestic creatures, the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing polar bears.\nA significant portion of the polar bear population resides in Canada, where two-thirds of all polar bears live. About 16,000 polar bears are spread across 13 provinces and territories, including Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Notably, Churchill, Manitoba, is known as the polar bear capital of the world due to its high concentration of these animals.\nIn the United States, Alaska is the only state with a polar bear population, estimated to be between 4,000 and 7,000 individuals. The polar bears in Alaska are primarily divided into two subpopulations: those in the Chukchi Sea, or Alaska-Chukotka, and the Southern Beaufort Sea.\nRussia is home to an estimated 26,000 polar bears, living on islands and the mainland coast. Wrangel Island, a UNESCO-protected nature reserve in Russia, is often referred to as a polar bear maternity ward. Additional polar bear populations in Russia are found in the Barents Sea region, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and the Far East Village.\nGreenland's fjords and glacial ice are also home to polar bears, though they are elusive and rarely seen. It's estimated that around 4,400 polar bears inhabit Greenland, with two protected areas, Melville Bay and Greenland National Park, supporting polar bear populations.\nThe Svalbard archipelago in Norway is another prime location for spotting polar bears, with an estimated population of around 3,000. Despite their remote habitats, polar bear encounters can sometimes be dangerous. Since the 1970s, there have been six recorded human fatalities due to polar bear attacks.\nMost polar bears in captivity are found in zoos, aquariums, and parks across Europe, North America, and Asia, contributing to conservation and education efforts about these iconic Arctic inhabitants.\n\nThe global polar bear population is estimated to be 20000-25000 individuals as of 2023, shared between all countries included in the species' range: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States, as well as in international polar regions.\nPolar bears often roam from one country's territory into another, particularly in the winter when the polar ice reaches its broadest spread. As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This Page",
      "Graphing polar bear population estimates over\u00a0time\nI\u2019ve already commented on the 2013 update of polar bear population status released by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG).\nHowever, I thought it might be interesting to graph the changes in global population estimates over time (from 1981-2013) \u2014 not just the actual estimates from PBSG status tables (with their min/max error ranges) but those totals plus the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates that the PBSG have dropped from their accounts in recent (2005-2013) assessments: Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Queen Elizabeth Islands (now known as the \u201cArctic Basin\u201d), and Laptev Sea.\nIn 2001, those \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates contributed 5,000-5,400 bears to the global total, but now they\u2019re gone \u2014 no bears from those regions contribute to the official totals\u00a0listed on recent PBSG status tables.\nAdding those dropped estimates back into the global totals makes it possible to generate a graph in which the global estimates are truly comparable over time.\nTo see how the dropped estimates influenced the perception of population change over time, I\u2019ve also graphed the estimates given by the PBSG in their status tables. I\u2019ve combined the two into one image (Fig. 1, click to enlarge) to make comparison easy.\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below. The most recent numbers, added 31 May 2015, are here.\nUPDATE 26 March 2019: See \u201cLatest global polar bear abundance \u2018best guess\u2019 estimate is 39,000 (26,000-58,000)\u201d\n\nFigure 1. Upper graph uses totals reported in PBSG status tables, with min/max; Lower graph uses the same figures, but adds back in the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped 2005-2013. The 1960 figure * is a ballpark estimate\nWhat is apparent is that the global population of polar bears has not declined over the last 30 years, as the PBSG status tables indicate.\nAlthough it\u2019s true that the official estimates for 2005 and 2009 publicized by the PBSG (\u201c20,000-25,000\u201d) also indicated no recent change, the numbers listed on their status tables don\u2019t tell the same story. What\u2019s the point of insisting on supposedly more accurate \u201cscientific\u201d estimates if you don\u2019t use them to generate your official total?\nNote that the most recent status table released last week, for 2013, did not include a new total \u2014 if you wanted to know if the global total had changed (and if so, by how much), you had to add the figures up yourself. Nowhere on the PBSG website does it now list an official population estimate. What\u2019s that about?\n\nFinally, note that I\u2019ve included a ballpark estimate for 1960 that reflects international concern that many years of unregulated hunting had seriously depleted populations, as occurred for numerous other species (indicated as a broad range rather than a single figure). And while it is true that no one truly knows how many polar bears there were in 1960, it is also true that by that time, over-hunting had occurred on a large scale for decades, and that there were fewer bears then than there are now (see another discussion of that topic here).\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below:\nStatus of Canadian polar bear populations has been changed \u2013 more good news October 28, 2014\nW Hudson Bay polar bear population no longer \u201cdeclining\u201d \u2013 where are the headlines?

Where the status tables do not give a total for the maximum, minimum and average numbers (i.e., 2005, 2009, 2013), I\u2019ve used those listed in the first column of each table (Fig. 2 below, and upper panel of Fig. 1). For example, the min/max and average estimates (rounded to nearest 10) from the status tables for 2005-2013 are:\n2005 15,130-27,760 (average 21,420)\n 2009 14,220-25,160 (average 19,610)\n 2013 13,070-24,240 (average 18,349)\nFig. 2 Graph using the figures listed in PBSG status tables only.\nWhile I acknowledge that earlier estimates (from the 80s and 90s) used different methods than later ones, which may have made them less accurate, they were the \u201cbest available science\u201d at the time. The purpose of this exercise is to compare the PBSG published numbers from these documents:\n1981 8th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Anonymous 1985: Table 1)\n1993 11th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Wiig et al. 1995: Table 1)\n1997 12th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Derocher et al. 1998: Table 1)\n2001 13th Meeting \u2013 Nuuk, Greenland (Lunn et al. 2002: Table 1)\n2005 14th Meeting \u2013 Seattle, Washington (Aars et al. 2006: Table 1)\n2009 15th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Obbard et al. 2010: Table 1)\n2013 Online status update, posted February 14, 2014\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out previously, adjustments made to the PBSG status tables that dropped to zero estimates that had formerly been included in the global totals suggested that by 2009, the totals must actually have increased by 2650 to 5700 bears since 2001.\nSo to make the population estimates comparable over time, we really need to add back in the ballpark estimates for the Queen Elizabeth Islands (which includes any bears residing there and in the Arctic Basin, last estimated at 200 bears), East Greenland (2,000 bears) and the Chukchi Sea (2,000 bears)1, which were dropped in the 2005 and 2009 PBSG assessments, as well as the estimate for the Laptev Sea (800-1200 bears, dropped in 2013, discussed here).\n[I did not include adjustments for Barents Sea changes in this graph (as I did previously), to keep the comparison simple and because some people might not agree that the Barents Sea adjustment qualifies as the same kind of change as the dropped estimates]\nFigure 3. Graph using figures from the PBSG status tables plus \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped between 2005 & 2013.\nFootnote:\n1. Although the estimate for this region is indeed less \u201cscientifically\u201d accurate than those from regions that have been surveyed, it is very clear that large number of bears reside in the Chukchi Sea. For example, Rode and colleagues (Rode et al. 2014) used an estimate of 2,000 for the Chukchi Sea region (\u201cbased on extrapolation of den surveys\u201d) to argue that the Chukchi and the Southern Beaufort population of bears were of \u201csimilar size.\u201d PBSG biologists apparently like to have it both ways: ignore the Chukchi estimate when it doesn\u2019t suit them (for global estimates) but include it when they need it for statistical work.\nReferences\nAars, J., Lunn, N.

In addition, approximately 300 polar bears are held in captivity. However, the world's population of polar bears is on a decline, and some scientists fear they could become extinct by 2100. To protect these majestic creatures, the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing polar bears.\nA significant portion of the polar bear population resides in Canada, where two-thirds of all polar bears live. About 16,000 polar bears are spread across 13 provinces and territories, including Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Notably, Churchill, Manitoba, is known as the polar bear capital of the world due to its high concentration of these animals.\nIn the United States, Alaska is the only state with a polar bear population, estimated to be between 4,000 and 7,000 individuals. The polar bears in Alaska are primarily divided into two subpopulations: those in the Chukchi Sea, or Alaska-Chukotka, and the Southern Beaufort Sea.\nRussia is home to an estimated 26,000 polar bears, living on islands and the mainland coast. Wrangel Island, a UNESCO-protected nature reserve in Russia, is often referred to as a polar bear maternity ward. Additional polar bear populations in Russia are found in the Barents Sea region, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and the Far East Village.\nGreenland's fjords and glacial ice are also home to polar bears, though they are elusive and rarely seen. It's estimated that around 4,400 polar bears inhabit Greenland, with two protected areas, Melville Bay and Greenland National Park, supporting polar bear populations.\nThe Svalbard archipelago in Norway is another prime location for spotting polar bears, with an estimated population of around 3,000. Despite their remote habitats, polar bear encounters can sometimes be dangerous. Since the 1970s, there have been six recorded human fatalities due to polar bear attacks.\nMost polar bears in captivity are found in zoos, aquariums, and parks across Europe, North America, and Asia, contributing to conservation and education efforts about these iconic Arctic inhabitants.\n\nThe global polar bear population is estimated to be 20000-25000 individuals as of 2023, shared between all countries included in the species' range: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States, as well as in international polar regions.\nPolar bears often roam from one country's territory into another, particularly in the winter when the polar ice reaches its broadest spread. As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This Page",
      "Graphing polar bear population estimates over\u00a0time\nI\u2019ve already commented on the 2013 update of polar bear population status released by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG).\nHowever, I thought it might be interesting to graph the changes in global population estimates over time (from 1981-2013) \u2014 not just the actual estimates from PBSG status tables (with their min/max error ranges) but those totals plus the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates that the PBSG have dropped from their accounts in recent (2005-2013) assessments: Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Queen Elizabeth Islands (now known as the \u201cArctic Basin\u201d), and Laptev Sea.\nIn 2001, those \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates contributed 5,000-5,400 bears to the global total, but now they\u2019re gone \u2014 no bears from those regions contribute to the official totals\u00a0listed on recent PBSG status tables.\nAdding those dropped estimates back into the global totals makes it possible to generate a graph in which the global estimates are truly comparable over time.\nTo see how the dropped estimates influenced the perception of population change over time, I\u2019ve also graphed the estimates given by the PBSG in their status tables. I\u2019ve combined the two into one image (Fig. 1, click to enlarge) to make comparison easy.\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below. The most recent numbers, added 31 May 2015, are here.\nUPDATE 26 March 2019: See \u201cLatest global polar bear abundance \u2018best guess\u2019 estimate is 39,000 (26,000-58,000)\u201d\n\nFigure 1. Upper graph uses totals reported in PBSG status tables, with min/max; Lower graph uses the same figures, but adds back in the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped 2005-2013. The 1960 figure * is a ballpark estimate\nWhat is apparent is that the global population of polar bears has not declined over the last 30 years, as the PBSG status tables indicate.\nAlthough it\u2019s true that the official estimates for 2005 and 2009 publicized by the PBSG (\u201c20,000-25,000\u201d) also indicated no recent change, the numbers listed on their status tables don\u2019t tell the same story. What\u2019s the point of insisting on supposedly more accurate \u201cscientific\u201d estimates if you don\u2019t use them to generate your official total?\nNote that the most recent status table released last week, for 2013, did not include a new total \u2014 if you wanted to know if the global total had changed (and if so, by how much), you had to add the figures up yourself. Nowhere on the PBSG website does it now list an official population estimate. What\u2019s that about?\n\nFinally, note that I\u2019ve included a ballpark estimate for 1960 that reflects international concern that many years of unregulated hunting had seriously depleted populations, as occurred for numerous other species (indicated as a broad range rather than a single figure). And while it is true that no one truly knows how many polar bears there were in 1960, it is also true that by that time, over-hunting had occurred on a large scale for decades, and that there were fewer bears then than there are now (see another discussion of that topic here).\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below:\nStatus of Canadian polar bear populations has been changed \u2013 more good news October 28, 2014\nW Hudson Bay polar bear population no longer \u201cdeclining\u201d \u2013 where are the headlines? October 29, 2014\nThe Politics of Polar Bears documentary [excerpt links]  September 3, 2014\nNOTES ON METHODS\nWhere the PBSG status table for any given year (list below) gives a total range of estimates (maximum and minimum), as in 2001, I\u2019ve used the PBSG totals. Where the status tables do not give a total for the maximum, minimum and average numbers (i.e., 2005, 2009, 2013), I\u2019ve used those listed in the first column of each table (Fig. 2 below, and upper panel of Fig. 1). For example, the min/max and average estimates (rounded to nearest 10) from the status tables for 2005-2013 are:\n2005 15,130-27,760 (average 21,420)\n 2009 14,220-25,160 (average 19,610)\n 2013 13,070-24,240 (average 18,349)\nFig. 2 Graph using the figures listed in PBSG status tables only.\nWhile I acknowledge that earlier estimates (from the 80s and 90s) used different methods than later ones, which may have made them less accurate, they were the \u201cbest available science\u201d at the time. The purpose of this exercise is to compare the PBSG published numbers from these documents:\n1981 8th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Anonymous 1985: Table 1)\n1993 11th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Wiig et al. 1995: Table 1)\n1997 12th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Derocher et al. 1998: Table 1)\n2001 13th Meeting \u2013 Nuuk, Greenland (Lunn et al. 2002: Table 1)\n2005 14th Meeting \u2013 Seattle, Washington (Aars et al. 2006: Table 1)\n2009 15th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Obbard et al. 2010: Table 1)\n2013 Online status update, posted February 14, 2014\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out previously, adjustments made to the PBSG status tables that dropped to zero estimates that had formerly been included in the global totals suggested that by 2009, the totals must actually have increased by 2650 to 5700 bears since 2001.\nSo to make the population estimates comparable over time, we really need to add back in the ballpark estimates for the Queen Elizabeth Islands (which includes any bears residing there and in the Arctic Basin, last estimated at 200 bears), East Greenland (2,000 bears) and the Chukchi Sea (2,000 bears)1, which were dropped in the 2005 and 2009 PBSG assessments, as well as the estimate for the Laptev Sea (800-1200 bears, dropped in 2013, discussed here).\n[I did not include adjustments for Barents Sea changes in this graph (as I did previously), to keep the comparison simple and because some people might not agree that the Barents Sea adjustment qualifies as the same kind of change as the dropped estimates]\nFigure 3. Graph using figures from the PBSG status tables plus \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped between 2005 & 2013.\nFootnote:\n1. Although the estimate for this region is indeed less \u201cscientifically\u201d accurate than those from regions that have been surveyed, it is very clear that large number of bears reside in the Chukchi Sea. For example, Rode and colleagues (Rode et al. 2014) used an estimate of 2,000 for the Chukchi Sea region (\u201cbased on extrapolation of den surveys\u201d) to argue that the Chukchi and the Southern Beaufort population of bears were of \u201csimilar size.\u201d PBSG biologists apparently like to have it both ways: ignore the Chukchi estimate when it doesn\u2019t suit them (for global estimates) but include it when they need it for statistical work.\nReferences\nAars, J., Lunn, N.

      "Graphing polar bear population estimates over\u00a0time\nI\u2019ve already commented on the 2013 update of polar bear population status released by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG).\nHowever, I thought it might be interesting to graph the changes in global population estimates over time (from 1981-2013) \u2014 not just the actual estimates from PBSG status tables (with their min/max error ranges) but those totals plus the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates that the PBSG have dropped from their accounts in recent (2005-2013) assessments: Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Queen Elizabeth Islands (now known as the \u201cArctic Basin\u201d), and Laptev Sea.\nIn 2001, those \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates contributed 5,000-5,400 bears to the global total, but now they\u2019re gone \u2014 no bears from those regions contribute to the official totals\u00a0listed on recent PBSG status tables.\nAdding those dropped estimates back into the global totals makes it possible to generate a graph in which the global estimates are truly comparable over time.\nTo see how the dropped estimates influenced the perception of population change over time, I\u2019ve also graphed the estimates given by the PBSG in their status tables. I\u2019ve combined the two into one image (Fig. 1, click to enlarge) to make comparison easy.\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below. The most recent numbers, added 31 May 2015, are here.\nUPDATE 26 March 2019: See \u201cLatest global polar bear abundance \u2018best guess\u2019 estimate is 39,000 (26,000-58,000)\u201d\n\nFigure 1. Upper graph uses totals reported in PBSG status tables, with min/max; Lower graph uses the same figures, but adds back in the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped 2005-2013. The 1960 figure * is a ballpark estimate\nWhat is apparent is that the global population of polar bears has not declined over the last 30 years, as the PBSG status tables indicate.\nAlthough it\u2019s true that the official estimates for 2005 and 2009 publicized by the PBSG (\u201c20,000-25,000\u201d) also indicated no recent change, the numbers listed on their status tables don\u2019t tell the same story. What\u2019s the point of insisting on supposedly more accurate \u201cscientific\u201d estimates if you don\u2019t use them to generate your official total?\nNote that the most recent status table released last week, for 2013, did not include a new total \u2014 if you wanted to know if the global total had changed (and if so, by how much), you had to add the figures up yourself. Nowhere on the PBSG website does it now list an official population estimate. What\u2019s that about?\n\nFinally, note that I\u2019ve included a ballpark estimate for 1960 that reflects international concern that many years of unregulated hunting had seriously depleted populations, as occurred for numerous other species (indicated as a broad range rather than a single figure). And while it is true that no one truly knows how many polar bears there were in 1960, it is also true that by that time, over-hunting had occurred on a large scale for decades, and that there were fewer bears then than there are now (see another discussion of that topic here).\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below:\nStatus of Canadian polar bear populations has been changed \u2013 more good news October 28, 2014\nW Hudson Bay polar bear population no longer \u201cdeclining\u201d \u2013 where are the headlines? October 29, 2014\nThe Politics of Polar Bears documentary [excerpt links]  September 3, 2014\nNOTES ON METHODS\nWhere the PBSG status table for any given year (list below) gives a total range of estimates (maximum and minimum), as in 2001, I\u2019ve used the PBSG totals. Where the status tables do not give a total for the maximum, minimum and average numbers (i.e., 2005, 2009, 2013), I\u2019ve used those listed in the first column of each table (Fig. 2 below, and upper panel of Fig. 1). For example, the min/max and average estimates (rounded to nearest 10) from the status tables for 2005-2013 are:\n2005 15,130-27,760 (average 21,420)\n 2009 14,220-25,160 (average 19,610)\n 2013 13,070-24,240 (average 18,349)\nFig. 2 Graph using the figures listed in PBSG status tables only.\nWhile I acknowledge that earlier estimates (from the 80s and 90s) used different methods than later ones, which may have made them less accurate, they were the \u201cbest available science\u201d at the time. The purpose of this exercise is to compare the PBSG published numbers from these documents:\n1981 8th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Anonymous 1985: Table 1)\n1993 11th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Wiig et al. 1995: Table 1)\n1997 12th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Derocher et al. 1998: Table 1)\n2001 13th Meeting \u2013 Nuuk, Greenland (Lunn et al. 2002: Table 1)\n2005 14th Meeting \u2013 Seattle, Washington (Aars et al. 2006: Table 1)\n2009 15th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Obbard et al. 2010: Table 1)\n2013 Online status update, posted February 14, 2014\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out previously, adjustments made to the PBSG status tables that dropped to zero estimates that had formerly been included in the global totals suggested that by 2009, the totals must actually have increased by 2650 to 5700 bears since 2001.\nSo to make the population estimates comparable over time, we really need to add back in the ballpark estimates for the Queen Elizabeth Islands (which includes any bears residing there and in the Arctic Basin, last estimated at 200 bears), East Greenland (2,000 bears) and the Chukchi Sea (2,000 bears)1, which were dropped in the 2005 and 2009 PBSG assessments, as well as the estimate for the Laptev Sea (800-1200 bears, dropped in 2013, discussed here).\n[I did not include adjustments for Barents Sea changes in this graph (as I did previously), to keep the comparison simple and because some people might not agree that the Barents Sea adjustment qualifies as the same kind of change as the dropped estimates]\nFigure 3. Graph using figures from the PBSG status tables plus \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped between 2005 & 2013.\nFootnote:\n1. Although the estimate for this region is indeed less \u201cscientifically\u201d accurate than those from regions that have been surveyed, it is very clear that large number of bears reside in the Chukchi Sea. For example, Rode and colleagues (Rode et al. 2014) used an estimate of 2,000 for the Chukchi Sea region (\u201cbased on extrapolation of den surveys\u201d) to argue that the Chukchi and the Southern Beaufort population of bears were of \u201csimilar size.\u201d PBSG biologists apparently like to have it both ways: ignore the Chukchi estimate when it doesn\u2019t suit them (for global estimates) but include it when they need it for statistical work.\nReferences\nAars, J., Lunn, N.

      "The UN has made population projections for more than 50 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how accurate have they been?\nMost UN projections of global population have been close to the final estimates, several decades into the future.\nThe size of the human population is one of the most important metrics to understand the world. This is true globally, regionally, nationally, and at local levels. Total numbers are often meaningless without the context of population figures.\nThis doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just apply to population sizes today: we also want to understand what populations might look like in the future. We need it to allocate resources and budgets, and to understand health, socioeconomic, environmental, and other demographic trends.\nThat means accurate population projections are very valuable. They let us plan for the future.\nThe United Nations (UN) publishes projections in its World Population Prospects. It has been doing this periodically for more than 50 years.\nBut how much should we trust these projections?\nOne way to gauge the credibility of UN projections for the future is to look back at its track record of predictions in the past.\nIn this article, I compare the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historical projections to the latest population estimates to see how close they were.\nMost of the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historical population projections have been close to final estimates\nMany of the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historical projections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even as far back as the 1960s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been remarkably close to the truth.\nEvery few years, the UN publishes a new report on population trends, which it calls a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The report published in 2022 is called the \u00e2\u20ac\u01532022 revision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; the one from 1990 is the \u00e2\u20ac\u01531990 revision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, etc.\nIn the chart, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shown a range of these historical revisions, with their projections for the world population between 1970 and 2020. The UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest population estimates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is our closest estimate of the true population \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are also shown for comparison.\nIf you hover over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclatest observed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data label on the chart you can see how it compares to the various projections around it.\nAs you can see, most historical projections were close to the final figure, even when projecting three to four decades in the future. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take a close look at the exact figures below.\nMost projections differed from the latest estimates by just 1% to 2%. Many were within 1%, and none differed by more than 5%.1 This is not bad, especially considering that global estimates of the world population today can vary by around 1% between sources.2\nWe can also take a closer look at how these historical projections stack up. In the table, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve provided the latest population estimates from the UN in the top row (so you can see the global population in 1980, 1990, 2000, etc.).\nBelow are the exact numbers that each UN population revision projected for these same years. So you can see that the 1968 revision projected that the world population in 1980 would be 4.46 billion. The actual number was 4.44 billion. So, pretty close. But further out the difference becomes considerable \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for the year 2000 the demographers back in the late 60s overestimated the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population size.\nYou can see that the projections across the years did vary, but most clustered within a small range and came pretty close to the final estimate.\nGlobal projections have been relatively accurate, but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t true for every region\nWe should not assume that because global projections have been reasonably accurate, projections for individual countries or regions have been equally so. This also applies to specific age groups.\nOver- and under-estimates of particular populations canceled each other out, leading to a total figure that seemed more accurate than it was for individual groups. For example, an overestimate of the population in Asia could be partly canceled out by an underestimate in Europe.\nIn a paper published in Population Studies, the researcher Nico Keilman, studied the accuracy of UN population projections by looking at the errors of large regions, age groups, and specific estimates of fertility and mortality trends.3\nTo give one example: in Europe, UN projections would often overestimate the number of future children in a population but underestimate the number of elderly people. This was because the UN expected birth rates to be higher than they turned out, and it was at the same time too pessimistic about improvements in life expectancy (especially for women).\nAnother significant error for some regions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c affecting mostly Africa, Asia, and Latin America \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was inaccurate population estimates in the first place (in what we would call the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153base year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when the time-series starts). Many countries in these regions had poor census records and national statistics on the size and structure of the population. If the population in the start year is wrong, the projected population could be very wrong, even if you make reasonable assumptions about changes in fertility and mortality trends.\nKeilman notes that the quality of population data has improved over time, so this inaccuracy got smaller over time.\nLong-term projections are less accurate\nGlobal population projections often perform well when we compare them to reality 5, 10, or 20 years into the future. But over longer timescales, they often diverged from the real pathway.\nSee the chart below, which extends the historical projections further into the future \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to 2030. You can see that in earlier years, there was much less variation between them. But with time, they start to diverge.\nThis makes sense: to make projections about the population, researchers need to make assumptions about how fertility rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the number of children the average woman has \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and life expectancy will change. And researchers need to do this across the world, with very different starting points and socioeconomic futures. Small errors in these assumptions at the start of a trend will accumulate and turn into much larger ones.\nWe can understand the challenges in making long-term projections by looking at the most recent UN projections. In its 2019 revision, the UN projected that the world population would not peak by the end of the century: it expected numbers to reach 10.9 billion by 2100 and continue to grow slowly in the early 22nd century. Its 2022 revision however made quite a different projection: now the UN expects that the world population will peak at around 10.4 billion people in the mid-2080s.\nThis update, of course, came from an improved understanding of how fertility rates and other demographic indicators were changing across the world. But it highlights how hard it is to predict these changes for every country, 50 to 100 years into the future.\nTo summarize, short-to-medium-term projections have often been close to the true figure. But the global aggregates can hide errors on the national and regional level and we should be cautious about relying too heavily on long-term ones.\nEndnotes\nHere we look at UN reports dating back to 1968 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was not possible to find earlier versions of UN reports. However, other studies note that projections in the 1950s had much larger error margins: they were often out by more than 10%.\nKeilman, N. (2001). Data quality and accuracy of United Nations population projections, 1950-95. Population Studies, 55(2), 149-164.\nThe difference in 2023 estimates of the world population between the UN and the US Census Bureau is around 0.8%. The UN estimates the mid-year population to be 8,045,311,500. The US Census Bureau estimates 7,979,261,010. In some years, this gap has been even larger.\nKeilman, N. (2001).

      "Heat Stress on the Great Barrier Reef\nMarch 4, 2024JPEG\nAustralia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef has been hit by widespread coral bleaching caused by heat stress, government officials confirmed on March 8, 2024. This is the fifth mass bleaching of the reef since 2016. \nAerial surveys of over 300 reefs conducted by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which monitors the health of the coral, found bleaching in shallow water areas spanning two-thirds of the reef. \n\u201cThe results of the aerial survey and the coral bleaching that we are seeing are consistent with the patterns of heat stress that have been building over the reef over the summer months,\u201d said Roger Beeden, chief scientist at the reef authority. \nThe Great Barrier Reef lies off the northeast coast of Queensland, Australia. It is one of the richest and most biodiverse natural ecosystems on Earth. Spread across 346,000 square kilometers (134,000 square miles) of the Coral Sea, it comprises 2,500 individual reefs and more than 900 islands. \nBleaching events are caused by sustained, warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae known as zooxanthellae, which provide the coral polyps with nutrients as well as their bright colors. Heat stress causes the corals to expel the zooxanthellae, leaving the skeletal structures with a \u201cbleached\u201d appearance. \nA common metric used to assess the risk to coral reefs from high water temperature is the number of weeks that sea surface temperatures have exceeded the mean monthly maximum temperature by 1 degree Celsius. Significant coral bleaching may occur after 4 weeks of elevated temperatures, and severe, widespread coral bleaching is likely after 8 such weeks. As of early March, parts of the reef had been exposed to between 8 and 10 hotter-than-normal weeks, according to the reef authority. \nThe map above shows sea surface temperature anomalies off the coast of eastern Australia on March 4, 2024. It is based on data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project, an effort by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that blends measurements of sea surface temperatures from multiple NASA, NOAA, and international satellites, as well as ship and buoy observations. Rather than showing absolute temperature, the anomaly reflects the difference between the sea surface temperature on March 4, 2024, and the 2003-2014 average for that day. \nPrevious mass bleaching events on the reef occurred in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, \u201cPrior to these years, there is no evidence of such widespread events in the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s 500-year coral record history.\u201d \nDuring the latter half of 2023 and beginning of 2024, trade winds in the Pacific Ocean relaxed, allowing warm water from the western Pacific to push into the eastern Pacific\u2014a phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o. This pattern, on top of human-caused climate change, has driven global average sea surface temperatures to record highs for the past 10 months. However, the relationship between El Ni\u00f1o and sea surface temperatures off the coast of eastern Australia is a bit more complicated. \n\u201cSea surface temperatures during El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events act a bit like a seesaw,\u201d said Josh Willis, a climate scientist at JPL. \u201cWhen ocean temperatures during an El Ni\u00f1o are higher in the eastern Pacific, they\u2019re typically lower in the western Pacific.\u201d \nResearch has found that patterns in large-scale ocean circulation and climate change alone do not fully explain trends in sea surface temperatures and bleaching in the Coral Sea. Rather, weather patterns during El Ni\u00f1o events have historically suppressed the Australian summer monsoon, resulting in reduced cloud cover and higher-than-average air temperatures. These conditions play a big role in determining temperatures in the Coral Sea and the extent and location of coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef. \nNASA Earth Observatory image by Michala Garrison, using data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project and reef information from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA).

We also recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land and sea Country on which the Australian Institute of Marine Science works and as Australia\u2019s first scientists. Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023\u20132024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short \u2022 This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). \u2022 Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. \u2022 Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. \u2022 Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. \u2022 Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1\u20132.5\u00b0C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. \u2022 The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. \u2022 The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 \u2013 December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 \u2013 January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. \u2022 Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. \u2022 In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. \u2022 Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. \u2022 On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. \u2022 On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% \u2013 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. \u2022 On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. \u2022 The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. \u2022 It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. \u2022 The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer\u2019s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS\u2019 coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 12 reefs had >30% \u2013 50% cover and four reefs had >50% \u2013 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA. Central Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cooktown to Proserpine) Surveyed August 2023 to June 2024 Image 2: Variable reef state on the Central GBR. A. Storm damage from Cyclone Kirrily on Kelso Reef. B. Coral assemblages were patchy at Beaver Reef. C. High coral cover but medium bleaching (10% \u2013 30% of corals) at Slate Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays D. Bleaching at Chicken Reef, on the outer shelf off Townsville. E. Flourishing coral gardens on the back reef of Agincourt Reef No. 1 offshore from Port Douglas. F. Coral cover has increased rapidly at Hyde Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% \u2013 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown\u2010of\u2010 thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% \u2013 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% \u2013 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% \u2013 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% \u2013 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% \u201350% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22\u201311.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% \u2013 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% \u2013 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does \u2018percent hard coral cover\u2019 mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% \u2013 10%, >10% \u2013 30%, >30% \u2013 50%, >50% \u2013 75% and >75% \u2013 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% \u2013 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% \u2013 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% \u2013 10%, b) >10% \u2013 30%, c) >30% \u2013 50% and d) >50% \u2013 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023\u20132024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths \u2013 Shallow (2\u20135m), Mid (7\u20139m) and Deep (9\u201312m) \u2013 and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%\u201350% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0\u20132 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2\u20134 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4\u20136 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6\u20138 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program. Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% \u2013 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% \u2013 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1\u20139.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2\u20139.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8\u2013 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2\u201311.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% \u2013 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% \u2013 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4\u201313.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3\u201315.6 DHWs \u2013 cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9\u201311.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3\u20139.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% \u2013 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% \u2013 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the \u2018shifting baseline\u2019 syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak \u2018wave\u2019 through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS\u2019 research and monitoring.

      "Heat Stress on the Great Barrier Reef\nMarch 4, 2024JPEG\nAustralia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef has been hit by widespread coral bleaching caused by heat stress, government officials confirmed on March 8, 2024. This is the fifth mass bleaching of the reef since 2016. \nAerial surveys of over 300 reefs conducted by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which monitors the health of the coral, found bleaching in shallow water areas spanning two-thirds of the reef. \n\u201cThe results of the aerial survey and the coral bleaching that we are seeing are consistent with the patterns of heat stress that have been building over the reef over the summer months,\u201d said Roger Beeden, chief scientist at the reef authority. \nThe Great Barrier Reef lies off the northeast coast of Queensland, Australia. It is one of the richest and most biodiverse natural ecosystems on Earth. Spread across 346,000 square kilometers (134,000 square miles) of the Coral Sea, it comprises 2,500 individual reefs and more than 900 islands. \nBleaching events are caused by sustained, warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae known as zooxanthellae, which provide the coral polyps with nutrients as well as their bright colors. Heat stress causes the corals to expel the zooxanthellae, leaving the skeletal structures with a \u201cbleached\u201d appearance. \nA common metric used to assess the risk to coral reefs from high water temperature is the number of weeks that sea surface temperatures have exceeded the mean monthly maximum temperature by 1 degree Celsius. Significant coral bleaching may occur after 4 weeks of elevated temperatures, and severe, widespread coral bleaching is likely after 8 such weeks. As of early March, parts of the reef had been exposed to between 8 and 10 hotter-than-normal weeks, according to the reef authority. \nThe map above shows sea surface temperature anomalies off the coast of eastern Australia on March 4, 2024. It is based on data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project, an effort by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that blends measurements of sea surface temperatures from multiple NASA, NOAA, and international satellites, as well as ship and buoy observations. Rather than showing absolute temperature, the anomaly reflects the difference between the sea surface temperature on March 4, 2024, and the 2003-2014 average for that day. \nPrevious mass bleaching events on the reef occurred in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, \u201cPrior to these years, there is no evidence of such widespread events in the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s 500-year coral record history.\u201d \nDuring the latter half of 2023 and beginning of 2024, trade winds in the Pacific Ocean relaxed, allowing warm water from the western Pacific to push into the eastern Pacific\u2014a phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o. This pattern, on top of human-caused climate change, has driven global average sea surface temperatures to record highs for the past 10 months. However, the relationship between El Ni\u00f1o and sea surface temperatures off the coast of eastern Australia is a bit more complicated. \n\u201cSea surface temperatures during El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events act a bit like a seesaw,\u201d said Josh Willis, a climate scientist at JPL. \u201cWhen ocean temperatures during an El Ni\u00f1o are higher in the eastern Pacific, they\u2019re typically lower in the western Pacific.\u201d \nResearch has found that patterns in large-scale ocean circulation and climate change alone do not fully explain trends in sea surface temperatures and bleaching in the Coral Sea. Rather, weather patterns during El Ni\u00f1o events have historically suppressed the Australian summer monsoon, resulting in reduced cloud cover and higher-than-average air temperatures. These conditions play a big role in determining temperatures in the Coral Sea and the extent and location of coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef. \nNASA Earth Observatory image by Michala Garrison, using data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project and reef information from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA).

We also recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land and sea Country on which the Australian Institute of Marine Science works and as Australia\u2019s first scientists. Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023\u20132024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short \u2022 This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). \u2022 Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. \u2022 Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. \u2022 Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. \u2022 Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1\u20132.5\u00b0C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. \u2022 The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. \u2022 The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 \u2013 December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 \u2013 January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. \u2022 Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. \u2022 In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. \u2022 Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. \u2022 On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. \u2022 On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% \u2013 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. \u2022 On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. \u2022 The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. \u2022 It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. \u2022 The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer\u2019s disturbances.

Reefs are defined as Recovering when they were previously classified with an Established or Severe Outbreak but currently have COTS numbers below outbreak thresholds. d) The coral bleaching severity (percent of hard corals bleached) recorded during in-water LTMP manta tow surveys. e) The coral bleaching severity (percent of hard corals bleached) recorded during aerial surveys. Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS\u2019 coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 12 reefs had >30% \u2013 50% cover and four reefs had >50% \u2013 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA. Central Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cooktown to Proserpine) Surveyed August 2023 to June 2024 Image 2: Variable reef state on the Central GBR. A. Storm damage from Cyclone Kirrily on Kelso Reef. B. Coral assemblages were patchy at Beaver Reef. C. High coral cover but medium bleaching (10% \u2013 30% of corals) at Slate Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays D. Bleaching at Chicken Reef, on the outer shelf off Townsville. E. Flourishing coral gardens on the back reef of Agincourt Reef No. 1 offshore from Port Douglas. F. Coral cover has increased rapidly at Hyde Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% \u2013 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown\u2010of\u2010 thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% \u2013 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% \u2013 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% \u2013 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% \u2013 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% \u201350% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22\u201311.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% \u2013 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% \u2013 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does \u2018percent hard coral cover\u2019 mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% \u2013 10%, >10% \u2013 30%, >30% \u2013 50%, >50% \u2013 75% and >75% \u2013 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% \u2013 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% \u2013 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% \u2013 10%, b) >10% \u2013 30%, c) >30% \u2013 50% and d) >50% \u2013 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023\u20132024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths \u2013 Shallow (2\u20135m), Mid (7\u20139m) and Deep (9\u201312m) \u2013 and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%\u201350% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0\u20132 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2\u20134 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4\u20136 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6\u20138 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program. Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% \u2013 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% \u2013 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1\u20139.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2\u20139.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8\u2013 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2\u201311.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% \u2013 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% \u2013 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4\u201313.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3\u201315.6 DHWs \u2013 cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9\u201311.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3\u20139.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% \u2013 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% \u2013 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the \u2018shifting baseline\u2019 syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak \u2018wave\u2019 through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS\u2019 research and monitoring.

      "Background AIMS acknowledges the Traditional Owners of all the land and sea Countries in which we work, and we pay our respects to their elders past, present and emerging. We honour their continuing culture, knowledge, beliefs and spiritual relationship and connection to Country. We also recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land and sea Country on which the Australian Institute of Marine Science works and as Australia\u2019s first scientists. Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023\u20132024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short \u2022 This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). \u2022 Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. \u2022 Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. \u2022 Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. \u2022 Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1\u20132.5\u00b0C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. \u2022 The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. \u2022 The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 \u2013 December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 \u2013 January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. \u2022 Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. \u2022 In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. \u2022 Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. \u2022 On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. \u2022 On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% \u2013 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. \u2022 On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. \u2022 The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. \u2022 It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. \u2022 The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer\u2019s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS\u2019 coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 12 reefs had >30% \u2013 50% cover and four reefs had >50% \u2013 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA. Central Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cooktown to Proserpine) Surveyed August 2023 to June 2024 Image 2: Variable reef state on the Central GBR. A. Storm damage from Cyclone Kirrily on Kelso Reef. B. Coral assemblages were patchy at Beaver Reef. C. High coral cover but medium bleaching (10% \u2013 30% of corals) at Slate Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays D. Bleaching at Chicken Reef, on the outer shelf off Townsville. E. Flourishing coral gardens on the back reef of Agincourt Reef No. 1 offshore from Port Douglas. F. Coral cover has increased rapidly at Hyde Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% \u2013 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown\u2010of\u2010 thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% \u2013 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% \u2013 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% \u2013 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% \u2013 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% \u201350% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22\u201311.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% \u2013 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% \u2013 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does \u2018percent hard coral cover\u2019 mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% \u2013 10%, >10% \u2013 30%, >30% \u2013 50%, >50% \u2013 75% and >75% \u2013 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% \u2013 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% \u2013 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% \u2013 10%, b) >10% \u2013 30%, c) >30% \u2013 50% and d) >50% \u2013 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023\u20132024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths \u2013 Shallow (2\u20135m), Mid (7\u20139m) and Deep (9\u201312m) \u2013 and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%\u201350% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0\u20132 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2\u20134 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4\u20136 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6\u20138 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program. Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% \u2013 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% \u2013 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1\u20139.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2\u20139.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8\u2013 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2\u201311.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% \u2013 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% \u2013 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4\u201313.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3\u201315.6 DHWs \u2013 cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9\u201311.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3\u20139.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% \u2013 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% \u2013 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the \u2018shifting baseline\u2019 syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak \u2018wave\u2019 through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS\u2019 research and monitoring.

      "10 Impactful Ways to Conserve Coral Reefs\n\n\t\t\tBy: \t\t\tAuthor Our Endangered World \nPosted on Last updated: October 13, 2023\nWhat can we do to conserve coral reefs? Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat\u2019s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world\u2019s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don\u2019t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef\u2019s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens\u2019 labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don\u2019t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don\u2019t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water\u2019s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\u00a0\u00a0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n"

We honour their continuing culture, knowledge, beliefs and spiritual relationship and connection to Country. We also recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land and sea Country on which the Australian Institute of Marine Science works and as Australia\u2019s first scientists. Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023\u20132024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short \u2022 This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). \u2022 Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. \u2022 Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. \u2022 Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. \u2022 Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1\u20132.5\u00b0C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. \u2022 The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. \u2022 The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 \u2013 December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 \u2013 January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. \u2022 Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. \u2022 In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. \u2022 Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. \u2022 On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. \u2022 On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% \u2013 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. \u2022 On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. \u2022 The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. \u2022 It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. \u2022 The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer\u2019s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS\u2019 coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 12 reefs had >30% \u2013 50% cover and four reefs had >50% \u2013 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA. Central Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cooktown to Proserpine) Surveyed August 2023 to June 2024 Image 2: Variable reef state on the Central GBR. A. Storm damage from Cyclone Kirrily on Kelso Reef. B. Coral assemblages were patchy at Beaver Reef. C. High coral cover but medium bleaching (10% \u2013 30% of corals) at Slate Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays D. Bleaching at Chicken Reef, on the outer shelf off Townsville. E. Flourishing coral gardens on the back reef of Agincourt Reef No. 1 offshore from Port Douglas. F. Coral cover has increased rapidly at Hyde Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% \u2013 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown\u2010of\u2010 thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% \u2013 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% \u2013 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% \u2013 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% \u2013 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% \u201350% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22\u201311.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% \u2013 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% \u2013 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does \u2018percent hard coral cover\u2019 mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% \u2013 10%, >10% \u2013 30%, >30% \u2013 50%, >50% \u2013 75% and >75% \u2013 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% \u2013 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% \u2013 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% \u2013 10%, b) >10% \u2013 30%, c) >30% \u2013 50% and d) >50% \u2013 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023\u20132024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths \u2013 Shallow (2\u20135m), Mid (7\u20139m) and Deep (9\u201312m) \u2013 and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%\u201350% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0\u20132 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2\u20134 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4\u20136 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6\u20138 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program. Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% \u2013 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% \u2013 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1\u20139.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2\u20139.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8\u2013 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2\u201311.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% \u2013 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% \u2013 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4\u201313.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3\u201315.6 DHWs \u2013 cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9\u201311.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3\u20139.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% \u2013 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% \u2013 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the \u2018shifting baseline\u2019 syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak \u2018wave\u2019 through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS\u2019 research and monitoring.

      "10 Impactful Ways to Conserve Coral Reefs\n\n\t\t\tBy: \t\t\tAuthor Our Endangered World \nPosted on Last updated: October 13, 2023\nWhat can we do to conserve coral reefs? Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat\u2019s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world\u2019s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don\u2019t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef\u2019s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens\u2019 labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don\u2019t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don\u2019t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water\u2019s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\u00a0\u00a0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n"

      "10 Impactful Ways to Conserve Coral Reefs\n\n\t\t\tBy: \t\t\tAuthor Our Endangered World \nPosted on Last updated: October 13, 2023\nWhat can we do to conserve coral reefs? Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat\u2019s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world\u2019s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don\u2019t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef\u2019s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens\u2019 labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don\u2019t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don\u2019t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water\u2019s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\u00a0\u00a0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n",

This is a sharp increase from the previous assessment, published in 2008, which found a third of corals were in danger of being lost.\nClimate change is the leading cause of the declines, with high temperatures causing corals to eject the photosynthetic algae that live in their tissues. These events, known as bleaching, are becoming more extreme and more frequent, and causing mass die-offs in reefs across the world.\nThe IUCN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Director General, Dr Grethel Aguilar, has called for strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions as the best option to protect these vital species.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis global coral assessment vividly illustrates the severe impacts of our rapidly changing climate on life on Earth and drives home the severity of the consequences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealthy ecosystems like coral reefs are essential for human livelihoods \u00e2\u0080\u0093 providing food, stabilising coastlines, and storing carbon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe protection of our biodiversity is not only vital for our wellbeing but crucial for our survival. Climate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nCorals get their colour from the photosynthetic algae that live inside them, as part of a relationship which has lasted for over 380 million years. \u00c2\u00a9 Alexandre.ROSA/ Shutterstock\nHow endangered are corals, and why are they important?\nThe results of the latest Red List are the latest reminder of the dangers that reef-building corals face, with the animals having become more threatened with every reassessment of their health.\nWhile Red List assessments have changed over the past 30 years, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated that just 13 coral species were considered Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered in the 1990s. By the time of the next assessment in 2008, this figure had risen to 231.\nIt has now risen again, by more than 100, meaning almost half of all corals are at significant risk of extinction. This makes corals proportionately more endangered than all the major animal groups on land, including amphibians, mammals and reptiles.\nIf these coral species do become extinct, their loss would cause major changes for life in the oceans. Coral reefs support around a quarter of all marine life, and so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that coral extinctions could cause losses among fish, crustaceans and many other groups.\nThe loss of coral reefs would also remove an important nursery habitat for fish, as the hard skeletons provide a safe area for small fish to grow up in, away from large predators. Fewer nursery habitats would likely mean fewer fish, impacting both predator populations and fisheries.\nThe economic impact of coral extinctions goes much further than fishing, with reefs estimated to prevent billions of pounds worth of damage from flooding and erosion every year by breaking up waves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also likely tourism would suffer, cutting off a vital source of income for many communities.\nThe most at-risk reefs are in the Atlantic, where half of all species are at risk of extinction and a quarter are Critically Endangered. In a separate paper, published in PLOS One, researchers have examined the threats facing these corals in particular.\nThe staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis is found in the Atlantic, and is considered Critically Endangered under the most recent Red List. \u00c2\u00a9\u00c2\u00a0Alberto Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez-Ram\u00c3\u00adrez\nWhy are Atlantic corals so threatened?\nWhile the vast majority of reefs are found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, around 10% are found in the Atlantic. These corals are very distinct from their relatives, having been separated from other corals by the joining of North and South America over three million years ago.\nIn total, 85 shallow-water coral species live in the Atlantic, with the most important hotspots found in the Caribbean and off the coast of Brazil.\u00c2\u00a0As study co-author Dr Nadia Santodomingo explains, the limited ability of these species to respond to the threats facing them means these reefs are more vulnerable to collapse.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAtlantic corals have been hit the hardest by reef decline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Nadia, a Curator of Fossil Cnidaria at the Natural History Museum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing a perfect storm of threats, of which climate change is just one part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese corals are being significantly impacted by overfishing, pollution and coral diseases which are more prevalent in the Atlantic than in other regions. As a result, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprised to see the results of the IUCN assessment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDisease has perhaps had the most dramatic impact on Atlantic corals, devastating not only the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corals but also the animals they depend on. An unknown illness is suspected to have killed as much as 98% of the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-spined sea urchins in the 1980s, meaning these grazers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent algae from dominating many reefs.\nNew diseases are continuing to emerge, with stony coral tissue loss disease first detected in 2014. The illness has spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean, killing as many as 94% of all infected corals.\nRising temperatures are also an increasing threat, with bleaching just the tip of the iceberg. Higher levels of carbon dioxide are making the ocean more acidic, making it harder for corals to grow their calcium carbonate skeletons. Climate change has also been linked with rising numbers of hurricanes in the region, which are washing away centuries-old reefs in a matter of hours.\nWhile the PLOS One study raises plenty of cause for concern, it also notes some reasons to be hopeful. After the devastating declines of the 1970s and 1980s, the researchers found that the fall in Atlantic coral cover appears to be getting smaller.\nTo support these green shoots of recovery, further research needs to be taken to understand how corals can adapt to the challenges that face them. As Dr Beth Polidoro, a co-lead author of the paper, explains, this must go hand in hand with urgent action to combat climate change and the other threats facing coral.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions alongside action to address local threats if we want to give coral reefs a chance to survive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Beth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy acting now, we can slow the pace of ocean warming and broaden the window of opportunity for corals to potentially adapt and survive in the long term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRead more\nDiscover oceans\nFind out more about why we need to protect oceans and read about the pioneering work of our marine scientists.\nRelated posts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoral reefs cover more of Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface than realised, new estimates reveal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSatellite images have revealed a missing 64,000 square kilometres of coral cover, an area similar to the size of Ireland.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver half of coral reef cover across the world has been lost since 1950\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCoral reefs have declined by over half since the 1950s as they suffer from the effects of climate change and overfishing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe resilient coral reefs surviving ocean warming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOcean warming is threatening coral reefs but some reefs are surviving the warming waters and offer hope for these vital ecosystems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighlighting coral reefs at risk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat can antique corals reveal about the impact of climate change on the ocean?\nDon't miss a thing\nReceive email updates about our news, science, exhibitions, events, products, services and fundraising activities.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nAssessing the U.S. Climate in March 2024\n\n\n    Severe storms brought large hail and tornadoes to portions of the Midwest; blizzard buried parts of California under feet of snow\n    \nKey Points:\nOther Highlights:\u00a0\nTemperature\n\n\nThe average temperature of the contiguous U.S. in March was 45.1\u00b0F, 3.6\u00b0F above average, ranking 17th warmest in the 130-year record. March temperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S., while below-average temperatures were observed in small pockets of the West and Southwest.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 14.1\u00b0F, 3.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the 100-year period of record for the state. Above-average temperatures were observed across much of the state with near-normal temperatures in parts of the North Slope, Interior, Southwest and parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\n\n\nFor January\u2013March, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 39.4\u00b0F, 4.2\u00b0F above average, ranking fifth warmest on record for this period. Temperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast. Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest for the January\u2013March period.\nThe Alaska January\u2013March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above normal for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nPrecipitation\n\n\nMarch precipitation for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida. Maine and Rhode Island each had their second-wettest March on record.\nAlaska\u2019s average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\n\n\nThe January\u2013March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Conversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period.\nThe January\u2013March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nBillion-Dollar Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed in March 2024 after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\u00a0The U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters since 1980 where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2024). The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.Winter did not bring heavy snowfall to Wisconsin nor the temperatures necessary to maintain the snow, allowing fires to begin early and in high numbers. Between January\u2013March 2024, there have been more than 220 fires across Wisconsin.A 5.25-inch diameter hail stone fell in Ada, Oklahoma on March 14, which is the largest stone reported in Pontotoc County since 1950, as well as the largest to fall in the state in nearly 13 years.\nA state of emergency was declared for Ohio as several tornadoes struck the state, resulting in 3 fatalities on March 14 when an EF-3 tornado crossed Auglaize and Logan Counties.\nDrought\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor report, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nMonthly Outlook\nAbove-average temperatures are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast in April while above-average precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Visit the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s Official 30-Day Forecasts and U.S. Monthly Drought Outlook website for more details.\nSignificant wildland fire potential for April is above normal across much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains. For additional information on wildland fire potential, visit the National Interagency Fire Center\u2019s One-Month Wildland Fire Outlook.\nThis monthly summary from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making.

Each participant\u2019s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u2014including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u2014and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u201cAppropriate monetary policy\u201d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u2019s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u201312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n3.

The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u2019 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u2019 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nTable 2.

As described in the box \"Forecast Uncertainty,\" under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. Return to table\n2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. Return to table\n3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nForecast Uncertainty\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u201cfan charts\u201d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u2019 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBack to Top\nLast Update: September 18, 2024\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\n\nTools and Information\n\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies | Privacy Program\nAccessibility\n\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page Federal Reserve Instagram Page Federal Reserve YouTube Page Federal Reserve Flickr Page Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page Federal Reserve Threads Page Link to Federal Reserve Twitter Page Subscribe to RSS Subscribe to Email\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551"

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nAssessing the U.S. Climate in March 2024\n\n\n    Severe storms brought large hail and tornadoes to portions of the Midwest; blizzard buried parts of California under feet of snow\n    \nKey Points:\nOther Highlights:\u00a0\nTemperature\n\n\nThe average temperature of the contiguous U.S. in March was 45.1\u00b0F, 3.6\u00b0F above average, ranking 17th warmest in the 130-year record. March temperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S., while below-average temperatures were observed in small pockets of the West and Southwest.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 14.1\u00b0F, 3.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the 100-year period of record for the state. Above-average temperatures were observed across much of the state with near-normal temperatures in parts of the North Slope, Interior, Southwest and parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\n\n\nFor January\u2013March, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 39.4\u00b0F, 4.2\u00b0F above average, ranking fifth warmest on record for this period. Temperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast. Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest for the January\u2013March period.\nThe Alaska January\u2013March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above normal for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nPrecipitation\n\n\nMarch precipitation for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida. Maine and Rhode Island each had their second-wettest March on record.\nAlaska\u2019s average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\n\n\nThe January\u2013March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Conversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period.\nThe January\u2013March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nBillion-Dollar Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed in March 2024 after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\u00a0The U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters since 1980 where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2024). The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.Winter did not bring heavy snowfall to Wisconsin nor the temperatures necessary to maintain the snow, allowing fires to begin early and in high numbers. Between January\u2013March 2024, there have been more than 220 fires across Wisconsin.A 5.25-inch diameter hail stone fell in Ada, Oklahoma on March 14, which is the largest stone reported in Pontotoc County since 1950, as well as the largest to fall in the state in nearly 13 years.\nA state of emergency was declared for Ohio as several tornadoes struck the state, resulting in 3 fatalities on March 14 when an EF-3 tornado crossed Auglaize and Logan Counties.\nDrought\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor report, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nMonthly Outlook\nAbove-average temperatures are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast in April while above-average precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Visit the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s Official 30-Day Forecasts and U.S. Monthly Drought Outlook website for more details.\nSignificant wildland fire potential for April is above normal across much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains. For additional information on wildland fire potential, visit the National Interagency Fire Center\u2019s One-Month Wildland Fire Outlook.\nThis monthly summary from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making.

Each participant\u2019s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u2014including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u2014and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u201cAppropriate monetary policy\u201d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u2019s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u201312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u2019 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u2019 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nTable 2.

As described in the box \"Forecast Uncertainty,\" under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. Return to table\n2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. Return to table\n3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nForecast Uncertainty\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u201cfan charts\u201d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u2019 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBack to Top\nLast Update: September 18, 2024\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\n\nTools and Information\n\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies | Privacy Program\nAccessibility\n\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page Federal Reserve Instagram Page Federal Reserve YouTube Page Federal Reserve Flickr Page Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page Federal Reserve Threads Page Link to Federal Reserve Twitter Page Subscribe to RSS Subscribe to Email\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551"

Each participant\u2019s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u2014including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u2014and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u201cAppropriate monetary policy\u201d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u2019s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u201312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n3.

The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u2019 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u2019 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nTable 2.

For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1.

For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nForecast Uncertainty\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u201cfan charts\u201d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u2019 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBack to Top\nLast Update: September 18, 2024\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\n\nTools and Information\n\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies | Privacy Program\nAccessibility\n\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page Federal Reserve Instagram Page Federal Reserve YouTube Page Federal Reserve Flickr Page Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page Federal Reserve Threads Page Link to Federal Reserve Twitter Page Subscribe to RSS Subscribe to Email\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551",
      "L.A. County faces $12.5 billion in climate costs through 2040, study says\nA first-of-its-kind report has estimated  that Los Angeles County must invest billions of dollars through 2040 to protect residents from worsening climate hazards, including extreme heat, increasing precipitation, worsening wildfires, rising sea levels and climate-induced public health threats.\nThe report, published this week by the nonprofit Center for Climate Integrity, identified  14 different climate adaptation measures that authors calculated would  cost L.A. taxpayers at least $12.5 billion over the next 15 years, or approximately $780 million per year. The vast majority of those costs \u2014 more than $9 billion \u2014 will be incurred by local municipal governments, including the cities of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Santa Clarita, the report said.\n\u201cThese numbers don\u2019t include the costs of recovering from disasters \u2014 from extreme weather events that knock out power or damage infrastructure or do all the kinds of things they do,\u201d said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity. \u201cSo it\u2019s a very conservative estimate, and yet it\u2019s a really big number.\u201d \nAggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.\nWiles said the costs for L.A. County are nearly as high as for the entire state of Pennsylvania, which faces about $15 billion in climate adaptation costs over roughly the same  period. \n\u201cThis is a big number, but this is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThese costs will be incurred at some point, and it\u2019s just much better to pay now than it is to pay later. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough.\u201d\nThe most expensive adaptation categories are related to precipitation and heat, including an estimated $4.3 billion for improved stormwater management, $2.5 billion for cool pavement investments and $1.4 billion for tree canopies to combat urban heat islands, the report found. Other costs include wildfire mitigation; coastal defense and infrastructure protection; building upgrades for cooling and air conditioning; and responses to vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus.\nCounty officials said the findings weren\u2019t surprising and agreed that they may even be conservative given the scale of the threats. \n\u201cThe impacts of climate have become more and more visible over the past few years in particular,\u201d said Rita Kampalath, L.A. County\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re facing really, really huge needs in terms of how we prepare our communities to face those, and to be resilient in the face of increased climate impacts. It\u2019s only going to increase from here.\u201d\nStormwater capture in particular has been on the minds of many Angelenos this winter as record-breaking rainfall pounded the region. A monster storm in February saw the Los Angeles River roar to life and funnel millions of gallons  into the Pacific Ocean.\nBut the  river \u2014 which was encased in concrete nearly a hundred years ago \u2014 and other local  flood channels will be no match for climate change-enhanced storms of the future. Though the long-term trend in the West is toward hotter and drier conditions, Los Angeles will still see bouts of severe storms and extreme wet years that will increase flood risk significantly, according to the state\u2019s fourth climate change assessment. \nTo mitigate these impacts, the county must expand its stormwater drainage infrastructure by installing bioswales, porous pavement and other opportunities for stormwater to seep into the ground, the report found. It noted that these \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d upgrades are the least expensive option to cope with extreme rainfall events, as opposed to increasing the size and scale of hard infrastructure such as drain pipes. \n Climate & Environment \n The unloved L.A. River just prevented a flood disaster. Can more of its water be saved? \nCapturing rainfall is only one part of the L.A. River\u2019s job. It is also a flood control channel that is critical to protecting lives and properties when stormwaters surge. \nFeb. 8, 2024\nThe county is making progress on this work through its Safe Clean Water Program, passed by voters as Measure W in 2018, Kampalath said. The program allocates about $280 million annually to stormwater capture projects, although recent reports have found that progress to date has been slow. \n\u201cWhile it is a big need, I do actually feel like the county has been investing, and our residents and voters in particular have shown that this is a high priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not as far as we would like to be \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say that about much of anything when it comes to climate \u2014 but I do think that we have resources available to try to address some of these needs.\u201d \nMeanwhile, extreme heat continues to pose a significant threat to L.A. County residents, and it is  predicted to only get worse in the years and decades ahead. The region is expected to experience an average of 48.5 days above 90 degrees per year between 2024 and 2040, the report says. That\u2019s about 12.5 more hot days per year than communities experienced between 1994 and 2013. \nSome of the best methods to combat the dangers of rising heat include installing cool pavements, expanding urban green space, painting railway  tracks with reflective paint to keep them at operable temperatures, and upgrading cooling systems for public buildings such as schools, the report says. Converting public parking lots to cool pavements that reflect instead of absorb sunlight can also help lower ambient temperatures.\nHeat is \u201cthe impact that affects communities of color the most, and people less able to adapt themselves and their personal lives,\u201d Wiles said. He noted that some urban areas can simmer up to 20 degrees hotter than surrounding neighborhoods with heavy tree canopies. \n\u201cFrom a public health perspective, these types of adaptations are increasingly critical just to make neighborhoods livable,\u201d he said.\nThe report comes at a moment when the state is facing a significant $37.9-billion budget deficit, which has prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to slash $2.9 billion from California climate programs, delay an additional $1.9 billion and shift $1.8 billion to other funds. \nKampalath said it\u2019s too soon to say whether those cuts will trickle down to L.A. County\u2019s climate efforts, but that they could potentially affect  funds officials were hoping to take advantage of through grants and other programs.\nHowever, she noted that many of the county\u2019s climate adaptation strategies can have multiple benefits, such as tree canopy programs that help combat heat and improve stormwater management simultaneously.\n\u201cAs we\u2019re looking at how to address these impacts, we do need to think about a multi-benefit approach, and what kind of strategies we can put in place that are really going to address a wide range of things \u2014 not only climate, but biodiversity and health impacts and the well-being of our communities as well,\u201d she said.\n Climate & Environment \n As climate hazards converge, more Californians are living in harm\u2019s way \nWhen wildfire smoke and extreme heat combine, they create a \u201csynergistic effect\u201d or an additional burden on people\u2019s health, researchers say.\nFeb. 3, 2024\nUltimately, funding for the projects outlined in the report will come from taxpayers, whether at the municipal, state or federal level, Wiles said. But he also hopes that oil and gas companies will be held accountable for their role in the worsening climate crisis, as fossil fuel emissions are by far the largest driver of global warming.\nLast year, California filed a bombshell lawsuit against five of the largest oil and gas companies for their alleged \u201cdecades-long campaign of deception\u201d about the risks posed by fossil fuels, which have forced the state to spend billions of dollars to address environmental-related damages. State Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta is seeking to create a nuisance abatement fund to finance climate mitigation and adaptation efforts, among other outcomes. \n\u201cEach and every community in Los Angeles County should consider bringing similar legal actions to hold climate polluters accountable and ensure that taxpayers aren\u2019t left to pay the bill alone,\u201d the report says. \nIndeed, there are other climate hazards that will cost Angelenos billions in adaptation expenses over the next decade and a half, the report found. \nThey include an increase in vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus as more mosquitoes are drawn to the area\u2019s changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. About 500,000 new cases of the virus are expected in the county through 2040, which will cost an estimated $993 million to treat. Climate change will also lead to more pediatric asthma cases due to an increase in pollen, with about 160,000 new cases expected through 2040. \nThe county also needs about $680 million in road improvements as heat and rain contribute to more cracks, erosion and soft surfaces. A foot of sea level rise along the coast of L.A. County  will require at least $576 million for berms, flood walls, bank stabilization and other infrastructure measures to prevent flooding and to avoid infrastructure damage by 2040. \nWildfires, already getting larger, faster and more frequent across California, will necessitate nearly $1 billion  just to clear vegetation and other fuels from land around the county\u2019s infrastructure, the report found. It noted that L.A. County will face an average of 36 more high-fire days through 2040 when compared to the 1994-to-2013 baseline. \nThe estimated $919-million wildfire cost does not account for fighting fires or repairing damage from blazes. The 2018 Woolsey fire racked up an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in insured losses alone. \nWiles said the expenses outlined in the report won\u2019t solve climate change but will help \u201chold things where they are today,\u201d or least prevent the hazards from getting worse. \nHe said he hoped the report would help guide county officials as they face difficult choices about where, how and to what limited funds should be allocated. Investing in climate adaptations now can save money \u2014 and lives \u2014 later, he said. \n\u201cThese costs are still coming,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cThe next disaster will happen. This is just what it\u2019s going to cost to prepare.\u201d\nToward a more sustainable California\nGet Boiling Point, our newsletter exploring climate change, energy and the environment, and become part of the conversation \u2014 and the solution.\n You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. \nMore to Read \n Endorsement: Yes on Proposition 4.

Each participant\u2019s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u2014including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u2014and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u201cAppropriate monetary policy\u201d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u2019s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u201312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2.

The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u2019 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u2019 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nTable 2.

As described in the box \"Forecast Uncertainty,\" under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. Return to table\n2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. Return to table\n3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nForecast Uncertainty\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u201cfan charts\u201d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u2019 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBack to Top\nLast Update: September 18, 2024\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\n\nTools and Information\n\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies | Privacy Program\nAccessibility\n\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page Federal Reserve Instagram Page Federal Reserve YouTube Page Federal Reserve Flickr Page Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page Federal Reserve Threads Page Link to Federal Reserve Twitter Page Subscribe to RSS Subscribe to Email\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551",
      "L.A. County faces $12.5 billion in climate costs through 2040, study says\nA first-of-its-kind report has estimated  that Los Angeles County must invest billions of dollars through 2040 to protect residents from worsening climate hazards, including extreme heat, increasing precipitation, worsening wildfires, rising sea levels and climate-induced public health threats.\nThe report, published this week by the nonprofit Center for Climate Integrity, identified  14 different climate adaptation measures that authors calculated would  cost L.A. taxpayers at least $12.5 billion over the next 15 years, or approximately $780 million per year. The vast majority of those costs \u2014 more than $9 billion \u2014 will be incurred by local municipal governments, including the cities of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Santa Clarita, the report said.\n\u201cThese numbers don\u2019t include the costs of recovering from disasters \u2014 from extreme weather events that knock out power or damage infrastructure or do all the kinds of things they do,\u201d said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity. \u201cSo it\u2019s a very conservative estimate, and yet it\u2019s a really big number.\u201d \nAggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.\nWiles said the costs for L.A. County are nearly as high as for the entire state of Pennsylvania, which faces about $15 billion in climate adaptation costs over roughly the same  period. \n\u201cThis is a big number, but this is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThese costs will be incurred at some point, and it\u2019s just much better to pay now than it is to pay later. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough.\u201d\nThe most expensive adaptation categories are related to precipitation and heat, including an estimated $4.3 billion for improved stormwater management, $2.5 billion for cool pavement investments and $1.4 billion for tree canopies to combat urban heat islands, the report found. Other costs include wildfire mitigation; coastal defense and infrastructure protection; building upgrades for cooling and air conditioning; and responses to vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus.\nCounty officials said the findings weren\u2019t surprising and agreed that they may even be conservative given the scale of the threats. \n\u201cThe impacts of climate have become more and more visible over the past few years in particular,\u201d said Rita Kampalath, L.A. County\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re facing really, really huge needs in terms of how we prepare our communities to face those, and to be resilient in the face of increased climate impacts. It\u2019s only going to increase from here.\u201d\nStormwater capture in particular has been on the minds of many Angelenos this winter as record-breaking rainfall pounded the region. A monster storm in February saw the Los Angeles River roar to life and funnel millions of gallons  into the Pacific Ocean.\nBut the  river \u2014 which was encased in concrete nearly a hundred years ago \u2014 and other local  flood channels will be no match for climate change-enhanced storms of the future. Though the long-term trend in the West is toward hotter and drier conditions, Los Angeles will still see bouts of severe storms and extreme wet years that will increase flood risk significantly, according to the state\u2019s fourth climate change assessment. \nTo mitigate these impacts, the county must expand its stormwater drainage infrastructure by installing bioswales, porous pavement and other opportunities for stormwater to seep into the ground, the report found. It noted that these \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d upgrades are the least expensive option to cope with extreme rainfall events, as opposed to increasing the size and scale of hard infrastructure such as drain pipes. \n Climate & Environment \n The unloved L.A. River just prevented a flood disaster. Can more of its water be saved? \nCapturing rainfall is only one part of the L.A. River\u2019s job. It is also a flood control channel that is critical to protecting lives and properties when stormwaters surge. \nFeb. 8, 2024\nThe county is making progress on this work through its Safe Clean Water Program, passed by voters as Measure W in 2018, Kampalath said. The program allocates about $280 million annually to stormwater capture projects, although recent reports have found that progress to date has been slow. \n\u201cWhile it is a big need, I do actually feel like the county has been investing, and our residents and voters in particular have shown that this is a high priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not as far as we would like to be \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say that about much of anything when it comes to climate \u2014 but I do think that we have resources available to try to address some of these needs.\u201d \nMeanwhile, extreme heat continues to pose a significant threat to L.A. County residents, and it is  predicted to only get worse in the years and decades ahead. The region is expected to experience an average of 48.5 days above 90 degrees per year between 2024 and 2040, the report says. That\u2019s about 12.5 more hot days per year than communities experienced between 1994 and 2013. \nSome of the best methods to combat the dangers of rising heat include installing cool pavements, expanding urban green space, painting railway  tracks with reflective paint to keep them at operable temperatures, and upgrading cooling systems for public buildings such as schools, the report says. Converting public parking lots to cool pavements that reflect instead of absorb sunlight can also help lower ambient temperatures.\nHeat is \u201cthe impact that affects communities of color the most, and people less able to adapt themselves and their personal lives,\u201d Wiles said. He noted that some urban areas can simmer up to 20 degrees hotter than surrounding neighborhoods with heavy tree canopies. \n\u201cFrom a public health perspective, these types of adaptations are increasingly critical just to make neighborhoods livable,\u201d he said.\nThe report comes at a moment when the state is facing a significant $37.9-billion budget deficit, which has prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to slash $2.9 billion from California climate programs, delay an additional $1.9 billion and shift $1.8 billion to other funds. \nKampalath said it\u2019s too soon to say whether those cuts will trickle down to L.A. County\u2019s climate efforts, but that they could potentially affect  funds officials were hoping to take advantage of through grants and other programs.\nHowever, she noted that many of the county\u2019s climate adaptation strategies can have multiple benefits, such as tree canopy programs that help combat heat and improve stormwater management simultaneously.\n\u201cAs we\u2019re looking at how to address these impacts, we do need to think about a multi-benefit approach, and what kind of strategies we can put in place that are really going to address a wide range of things \u2014 not only climate, but biodiversity and health impacts and the well-being of our communities as well,\u201d she said.\n Climate & Environment \n As climate hazards converge, more Californians are living in harm\u2019s way \nWhen wildfire smoke and extreme heat combine, they create a \u201csynergistic effect\u201d or an additional burden on people\u2019s health, researchers say.\nFeb. 3, 2024\nUltimately, funding for the projects outlined in the report will come from taxpayers, whether at the municipal, state or federal level, Wiles said. But he also hopes that oil and gas companies will be held accountable for their role in the worsening climate crisis, as fossil fuel emissions are by far the largest driver of global warming.\nLast year, California filed a bombshell lawsuit against five of the largest oil and gas companies for their alleged \u201cdecades-long campaign of deception\u201d about the risks posed by fossil fuels, which have forced the state to spend billions of dollars to address environmental-related damages. State Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta is seeking to create a nuisance abatement fund to finance climate mitigation and adaptation efforts, among other outcomes. \n\u201cEach and every community in Los Angeles County should consider bringing similar legal actions to hold climate polluters accountable and ensure that taxpayers aren\u2019t left to pay the bill alone,\u201d the report says. \nIndeed, there are other climate hazards that will cost Angelenos billions in adaptation expenses over the next decade and a half, the report found. \nThey include an increase in vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus as more mosquitoes are drawn to the area\u2019s changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. About 500,000 new cases of the virus are expected in the county through 2040, which will cost an estimated $993 million to treat. Climate change will also lead to more pediatric asthma cases due to an increase in pollen, with about 160,000 new cases expected through 2040. \nThe county also needs about $680 million in road improvements as heat and rain contribute to more cracks, erosion and soft surfaces. A foot of sea level rise along the coast of L.A. County  will require at least $576 million for berms, flood walls, bank stabilization and other infrastructure measures to prevent flooding and to avoid infrastructure damage by 2040. \nWildfires, already getting larger, faster and more frequent across California, will necessitate nearly $1 billion  just to clear vegetation and other fuels from land around the county\u2019s infrastructure, the report found. It noted that L.A. County will face an average of 36 more high-fire days through 2040 when compared to the 1994-to-2013 baseline. \nThe estimated $919-million wildfire cost does not account for fighting fires or repairing damage from blazes. The 2018 Woolsey fire racked up an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in insured losses alone. \nWiles said the expenses outlined in the report won\u2019t solve climate change but will help \u201chold things where they are today,\u201d or least prevent the hazards from getting worse. \nHe said he hoped the report would help guide county officials as they face difficult choices about where, how and to what limited funds should be allocated. Investing in climate adaptations now can save money \u2014 and lives \u2014 later, he said. \n\u201cThese costs are still coming,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cThe next disaster will happen. This is just what it\u2019s going to cost to prepare.\u201d\nToward a more sustainable California\nGet Boiling Point, our newsletter exploring climate change, energy and the environment, and become part of the conversation \u2014 and the solution.\n You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. \nMore to Read \n Endorsement: Yes on Proposition 4.

As borders closed and people went into quarantine mode for almost two years, the fear remained consistent for a lot of popular tourist destinations as they wondered how they would recover following the global pandemic, and whether the industry would ever go back to the way it was before.\nWhile the same fears applied to the Maldives, a country where the economy largely depends on income from tourism, Maldives was one of the first destinations that opened its borders as early as July 2020. With this, visitors from all around the globe flooded the country, as the Maldives became a safe haven for anyone looking to get a glimpse of a more normal \u2018outside world\u2019. Even with this, people still remained skeptical about how the country\u2019s economy would recover from the downturn of the pandemic.\u00a0\nAnd now, almost three years after the pandemic, the fears are gone and the Maldivian tourism industry appears to be doing better. By the end of 2022, it became evident that the Maldivian tourism industry was picking up, better than ever following the pandemic as the country welcomed over 1.6 million tourists at the end of 2022. While this was a major accomplishment for the country, especially only a year after the lockdown was lifted for most nations, the arrivals really picked up for the Maldives in 2023.\u00a0\nIn the first few months of 2023, especially during January and February, the tourist arrivals for the Maldives were extremely positive, leaving the country\u2019s Tourism Ministry hopeful about reaching the 2 million milestone for the year 2023. In May 2023, however, there was a decline in the arrival rates, as the off-season hit the Maldives as the monsoon season is not popular among visitors travelling to the country. Even with this, the arrivals for this time period in 2022 were marked at 66,938 while this year the arrivals are at 62,816.\nThough May showed a decline in tourist arrivals, the total arrival numbers for the Maldives is proving to be positive as the annual total as of 10 June 2023 is at 846,674.\u00a0 This means the country is extremely close to hitting the million mark!\nAs of June 2023, the top arrival market for the Maldives remains very similar to last year with arrivals from India taking the top spot with 99,922 visitors, Russia following close with 99,356 visitors and the UK at a close third with 75,472 visitors as at 10 June 2023. China is at sixth place so far.\u00a0\nMaldives has a total 60,818 operational bed capacity as at 10 June 2023, with 68 percent of them in the resorts, and 24 percent in guesthouses.\u00a0\n\n                                    Eydhafushi is set to be transformed into a new urban hub with a housing project\n                                \n\n                                    Azerbaijan Airlines\u2019 inaugural flights link Azerbaijan and the Maldives\n                                \n\n                                    The Maldivian Government launches the Hiyaavahi Finance Scheme for affordable home construction projects\n                                \n\n                                    Noonu Atoll Maafaru Airport resumes international flights in time for peak tourist season\n                                \nMaldives Financial Review\n\n                            9th Floor, M.

As borders closed and people went into quarantine mode for almost two years, the fear remained consistent for a lot of popular tourist destinations as they wondered how they would recover following the global pandemic, and whether the industry would ever go back to the way it was before.\nWhile the same fears applied to the Maldives, a country where the economy largely depends on income from tourism, Maldives was one of the first destinations that opened its borders as early as July 2020. With this, visitors from all around the globe flooded the country, as the Maldives became a safe haven for anyone looking to get a glimpse of a more normal \u2018outside world\u2019. Even with this, people still remained skeptical about how the country\u2019s economy would recover from the downturn of the pandemic.\u00a0\nAnd now, almost three years after the pandemic, the fears are gone and the Maldivian tourism industry appears to be doing better. By the end of 2022, it became evident that the Maldivian tourism industry was picking up, better than ever following the pandemic as the country welcomed over 1.6 million tourists at the end of 2022. While this was a major accomplishment for the country, especially only a year after the lockdown was lifted for most nations, the arrivals really picked up for the Maldives in 2023.\u00a0\nIn the first few months of 2023, especially during January and February, the tourist arrivals for the Maldives were extremely positive, leaving the country\u2019s Tourism Ministry hopeful about reaching the 2 million milestone for the year 2023. In May 2023, however, there was a decline in the arrival rates, as the off-season hit the Maldives as the monsoon season is not popular among visitors travelling to the country. Even with this, the arrivals for this time period in 2022 were marked at 66,938 while this year the arrivals are at 62,816.\nThough May showed a decline in tourist arrivals, the total arrival numbers for the Maldives is proving to be positive as the annual total as of 10 June 2023 is at 846,674.\u00a0 This means the country is extremely close to hitting the million mark!\nAs of June 2023, the top arrival market for the Maldives remains very similar to last year with arrivals from India taking the top spot with 99,922 visitors, Russia following close with 99,356 visitors and the UK at a close third with 75,472 visitors as at 10 June 2023. China is at sixth place so far.\u00a0\nMaldives has a total 60,818 operational bed capacity as at 10 June 2023, with 68 percent of them in the resorts, and 24 percent in guesthouses.\u00a0\n\n                                    Eydhafushi is set to be transformed into a new urban hub with a housing project\n                                \n\n                                    Azerbaijan Airlines\u2019 inaugural flights link Azerbaijan and the Maldives\n                                \n\n                                    The Maldivian Government launches the Hiyaavahi Finance Scheme for affordable home construction projects\n                                \n\n                                    Noonu Atoll Maafaru Airport resumes international flights in time for peak tourist season\n                                \nMaldives Financial Review\n\n                            9th Floor, M.

      "Strategies for Mitigating Environmental Impacts of Tourism\nHave you ever gazed upon a pristine beach, an unspoiled forest, or a historic site brimming with ancient stories and wondered how these places can be preserved amidst the growing pressures of tourism? The answer lies in effective impact mitigation measures, strategies specially designed to balance the need for tourism development with the imperative of environmental preservation. Let\u2019s explore the innovative approaches that can help sustain the beauty and integrity of tourist destinations for generations to come.\nTackling the Challenges: Understanding Environmental Impacts of Tourism \ud83d\udd17\nBefore delving into mitigation strategies, it\u2019s crucial to comprehend the environmental impacts tourism can have. These range from natural resource depletion, pollution, and habitat destruction to wildlife disturbance and cultural erosion. Recognizing these impacts is the first step in formulating robust measures to counteract them.\nDepletion of Natural Resources \ud83d\udd17\nTourism often leads to increased consumption of water, energy, and land, putting a strain on these vital resources. In areas with limited availability, this can lead to significant ecological imbalances.\nPollution and Habitat Destruction \ud83d\udd17\nThe influx of tourists can result in increased waste, air, and water pollution. This not only affects the scenic value of a destination but also leads to the destruction of critical habitats for flora and fauna.\nWildlife Disturbance \ud83d\udd17\nClose encounters with wildlife may seem like an enriching experience, but they can disrupt natural behaviors and breeding patterns, threatening the survival of species.\nCultural Erosion \ud83d\udd17\nTourism can sometimes lead to the commercialization of culture, where traditions are modified to suit tourist expectations, risking the authenticity of local customs and practices.\nStrategies for Sustainable Tourism \ud83d\udd17\nHow can we mitigate these impacts and ensure that tourism contributes positively to environmental preservation? The following strategies offer a pathway to sustainable tourism development:\nTargeting Alternative Tourist Types \ud83d\udd17\nNot all tourists have the same environmental footprint. By promoting and developing facilities for eco-tourists, cultural enthusiasts, and adventure seekers who are more inclined to respect and preserve the environment, destinations can reduce their overall impact.\nEnhancing Resource Resistance \ud83d\udd17\nBuilding resilience: Strengthening the ability of natural and cultural sites to withstand tourist pressures is key. This can include measures such as using sustainable materials in construction, implementing water-saving techniques, and adopting renewable energy sources.\nEducation and Awareness \ud83d\udd17\nEmpowering stakeholders: Educating tourists, local communities, and industry stakeholders about the importance of environmental preservation creates a shared responsibility. Informative campaigns, guided tours with a focus on sustainability, and training programs for local businesses are effective tools.\nRegulating Tourist Numbers \ud83d\udd17\nLimits of acceptable change: By determining the carrying capacity of sites and setting limits on visitor numbers, destinations can prevent the overuse of resources and maintain the quality of the tourist experience.\nImplementing Effective Mitigation Measures \ud83d\udd17\nUnderstanding the necessity of impact mitigation is one thing; putting these measures into practice is another. Here\u2019s how stakeholders can operationalize these strategies:\nPolicy and Planning \ud83d\udd17\nGovernment and planning authorities must incorporate sustainability into tourism policies, ensuring that environmental considerations are at the forefront of development decisions.\nCommunity Involvement \ud83d\udd17\nLocal communities should be active participants in tourism planning and management, as they are often the custodians of the natural and cultural resources that attract tourists.\nMonitoring and Evaluation \ud83d\udd17\nContinuous monitoring of the environmental impacts of tourism helps in evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation measures and provides data for informed decision-making.\nStakeholder Collaboration \ud83d\udd17\nFrom tour operators to conservationists, all stakeholders must work collaboratively to promote and implement sustainable practices within the tourism industry.\nPromoting Responsible Tourism Practices \ud83d\udd17\nTo facilitate the adoption of impact mitigation measures, promoting responsible tourism practices among all stakeholders is vital. Here\u2019s what that entails:\nFor Tourists \ud83d\udd17\nEncouraging travelers to adopt eco-friendly habits, such as minimizing waste, conserving water, and respecting local customs, plays a significant part in reducing environmental impacts.\nFor Businesses \ud83d\udd17\nTourism businesses can lead by example, implementing green initiatives in their operations and educating their clientele on the importance of sustainability.\nFor Governments \ud83d\udd17\nCreating incentives for sustainable practices and enforcing environmental regulations ensures that the tourism industry aligns with broader conservation objectives.\nConclusion \ud83d\udd17\nImpact mitigation measures in tourism are not just strategies; they are necessary actions to ensure the longevity and integrity of our planet\u2019s precious destinations. By understanding and addressing the environmental impacts of tourism, promoting responsible tourism practices, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders, we can achieve a balance between the economic benefits of tourism and the preservation of natural and cultural resources.\nWhat do you think?

      "Hydrology and Big River Update\nAfter a wet and joyous 2023 water year, water managers and planners are feeling a little less optimistic about 2024. The good times from the previous period of plenty are now replaced with a feeling of foreboding, like the morning after a great party, as we face a below average forecast for 2024.\nLocally, there is good news to lessen the potential whiplash. Water supply conditions remain good with average to above average soil moisture conditions and healthy carryover storage projected for most of the reservoirs in the District. Also potentially hedging against a dry 2024, is the return of a strong El Ni\u00f1o, with near record warming of sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific. This is generally correlated with increased precipitation in the southwestern U.S, especially in the spring. According to NOAA Climate Prediction Center, \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o remains the major climate driver and is expected to be the primary influence on the mid-latitude circulation\u201d for the near term. Figure 1 reflects this with a slightly wetter near-term (Jan-March 2024) outlook.\nUnfortunately, the benefits of El Ni\u00f1o circulation patterns may be adversely influenced by the significant warming that is affecting the region and across the globe. Climate scientists have now confirmed that 2023 was officially the warmest year ever for the planet.\n\nAcross the Upper Basin and for inflows to Lakes Powell and Mead, the early water supply forecasts are not good and represent a significant departure from the heady days of 2023; the days of increasing or even stable reservoir levels may not persist into the near-term picture, without some changes.\nSince the last staff hydrology memo presented in October 2023, the once near-average seasonal inflow forecast volume for April to July of 2024 has decreased precipitously, losing more than 3 million acre-feet (\u201cmaf\u201d), according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center, due to excessively dry conditions. The current unregulated inflow forecast for Lake Powell is 4.80 maf or 75% of average and the unregulated inflow forecast for the entire water year for Lake Powell is 7.62 maf or 79% of average. Combined with a projected 7.48 MAF release from Glen Canyon dam, pursuant to the 2007 Interim guidelines, and consideration evaporation losses, annual inflow could be almost the same as annual outflow putting Lake Powell projected elevations to be unchanged at approximately the same elevation of 3668.5 feet AMSL at this same time next year, under this most probable (50% exceedance) inflow projection.\nFor Lake Mead, the most probable projection indicates that Level 1 shortages will likely persist in the Lower Basin in 2024, with Hoover Dam releases limited to about 8.4 million acre-feet to meet reduced downstream demands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Posts\t\t\t\t\t\nPhone: 970.945.8522 \nFax: 970.945.8799\nEmail: edinfo@crwcd.org\nColorado River Water Conservation District\n201 Centennial St., Suite 200\nGlenwood Springs, CO 81601\nInteractive Map\nFor accessibility inquiries or assistance, please contact:\nEmail: accessibility@crwcd.org\n",
      "Drought in the Colorado River Basin\nInsights using open data\nSince 2000, the Colorado River Basin (Basin) has been experiencing a historic, extended drought that has impacted regional water supply and other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and ecologic services. During this time, the Basin has experienced its lowest 16-year period of inflow in over 100 years of record keeping, and reservoir storage in the Colorado River system has declined from nearly full to about half of capacity. \nThis application was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation in support of the Department of the Interior\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Open Water Data Initiative (OWDI). This visualization is part of a multi-agency effort to showcase the usefulness of open data (i.e., data provided in a discoverable, sharable, and machine-readable format) by exploring the current 16-year drought and its effects on the Colorado River Basin. \nConcern is growing about the impacts of the ongoing drought and declining reservoir levels, such as decreasing water supply and the possibility of a first-ever shortage condition of drinking water for the Lower Basin; decreasing hydropower capacities at Lake Powell and Lake Mead; the potential for loss of hydroelectric generation at Lake Powell; reduced recreational opportunities; and changes to in-stream flows that support ecosystems.\nIn response to drought conditions, Federal agencies and stakeholders throughout the Basin have been working together to find creative ways to reduce the effects of the drought on the people and resources that rely on water from the Colorado River.\nScroll down to learn more about the importance of the Colorado River, the impacts of the current drought, and the ways in which the drought is being managed in the Basin.\nRead More >>\nThe Colorado River is a lifeline.\nWater from the Colorado River is essential for life in parts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. According to the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (2012), the Colorado River and its tributaries:\n Bureau of Reclamation, 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.   \nOne river, two parts.\nApproximately 1,400 miles long and flowing through seven U.S. States and into Mexico, the Colorado River drains roughly one-twelfth of the land area of the contiguous United States. The Colorado River Basin is divided into the Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry Colorado River Compact Point (Compact Point) located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona. The Lower Basin covers parts of Nevada, Arizona, California, southwestern Utah, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to parts of the states of Baja California and Sonora in northwestern Mexico.\n The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies approximately 90 percent of the water for the entire Basin. This water originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains. About 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow, which is surface water that percolates into groundwater aquifers and then resurfaces as streamflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). The Lower Basin is arid, with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  \n The Lower Basin depends upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its surrounding land habitable and productive. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the Basin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hydrologic boundary, including parts of southern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah. In addition, federally recognized Tribes hold a substantial amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries (approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of annual diversion rights).\nResources and facilities, such as dams and power plants, in the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the Law of the River and other project-specific operational guidelines. The Law of the River includes operating criteria, regulations, administrative decisions, Federal statutes, interstate compacts, court decisions and decrees, an international treaty, and contracts with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior (Secretary), and defines the responsibilities of the Secretary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water master role in the Lower Basin.\nRead More >>\nRumsey, C.A., et al. 2015. \"Regional scale estimates of baseflow and factors influencing baseflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin.\" Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 4: 91-107. \nLearn about the Colorado River Basin's network of reservoirs, water delivery infrastructure, and water delivery service areas.\nThe Colorado River is managed with a series of dams and canals that provide flood control, water conservation, and hydropower benefits.\nThe dams and canals in the Colorado River system provide storage for regional water supply, facilitate water deliveries, provide flood control benefits, improve navigation, and generate hydroelectric power. These facilities are operated in coordination with adjacent or nearby water delivery systems that also provide a variety of other economic, cultural, and ecologic benefits.\nIn the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed to control floods, improve navigation and regulate the river's flow, provide water storage and delivery, and generate electric energy. Davis Dam and Parker Dam were constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam. Near the southern end of the system, Imperial Dam serves as the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for the United States, with Morelos Dam diverting Colorado River water into Mexico.  \nWater is released from these facilities to satisfy delivery commitments to users in Nevada, California, Arizona and Mexico, and to generate hydropower with these water releases. Pumping facilities located on Lake Havasu behind Parker Dam divert water to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project.  From Imperial Dam's headworks, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam into Mexico. \nRead More >>\nThe diagram above depicts the major dams, reservoirs, and control structures of the Lower Colorado River.\nView real-time data and take a journey through major dams on the Lower Colorado River.\nWater supply varies over time.\nDue to year-to-year differences in precipitation and snowmelt, the natural water supply of the Basin is highly variable. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate. Since most of the Basin's water supply comes from the Upper Basin, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona, is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this stream gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and river diversions.\nIn the graphic above, the 10-year average natural flow at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average annual flow (approximately 14.8 million acre-feet [maf]). The most recent drought for the 2000-2015 period (indicated by the brown shaded area) was the driest 16-year period in the past 100 years and one of the driest 16-year periods in the past 1,200 years. The graphic also depicts how the early part of the 1900s, which corresponds to the period of reference used to set the apportionments for the Upper and Lower Basins in the 1922 Colorado River Compact, was an unusually wet period (indicated by the green shaded area). At the time the 1922 Colorado River Compact was signed, the average annual inflow at Lees Ferry during the pre-Compact period (1906-1921) was approximately 18.0 maf.\nUSGS observations of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry (USGS site 09380000) have been recorded since 1895. For more information and data on this site, visit the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System Lees Ferry stream gage website. Real-time gage height, discharge, water temperature, sediment, and water-quality properties can be accessed from the U.S. Geological Survey Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center website.\nThe Lees Ferry gage is distinct from the Lee Ferry Compact Point: Lees Ferry refers to the USGS-operated stream gage located near the town of Lees Ferry, Arizona; whereas Lee Ferry refers to the Colorado River Compact Point, as referenced in the 1922 Colorado River Compact. The Lee Ferry Compact Point is located 1 mile downstream of the Lees Ferry gage. \nHistorical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1,200 years, as estimated by Meko et al. (2007a). Because trees grow less during dry years and more during wet years, tree-ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree-ring core samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical natural flow. These estimates were validated using the observed natural flow record developed by the Bureau of Reclamation. \nExplore more about reconstructed natural flow based on tree-ring data.\n 1922 Colorado River Compact.\nBureau of Reclamation. 1922.

This period also ranks as the fifth driest 16-year period in the last 1,200 years (Meko et al., 2007a and 2007b).   \nWhile the current drought is severe and historic, the most extreme drought in the Colorado River Basin occurred in the mid-1100s (Meko et al. 2007a). The 1100s drought was characterized by a 25-year period of flows that were 15% lower than the long-term average of 14.8 maf and no higher-flow years (greater than 125% of average) for six decades. By comparison, the current drought is characterized by flows that are 16% lower than the long-term average with one year of higher flows (135% percent of average in 2011).\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor shows the extent and intensity of drought conditions in the Western U.S. from 2000 to 2015.

Medieval drought in the upper Colorado River Basin. Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, L10705.\nThe Colorado River Basin's abundant water storage capacity has made the Southwest more resilient to drought.\nThe basin-wide storage capacity of the Colorado River totals about 60 million acre-feet (maf), approximately four times the average annual inflow in the Upper Basin (14.8 maf). The Basin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead hold about 50 maf combined, which is approximately 83 percent of the total system storage capacity. This large storage capacity creates a buffer against year-to-year hydrologic variability and longer-term drought periods by allowing excess water to be stored during wet years and used during dry years. \nIt is this large amount of basin-wide storage capacity that has allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to meet water delivery requirements during the current drought period. It should be noted, however, that headwater reaches in the Upper Basin can experience localized shortages due to insufficient in-stream flows during dry years.\nThe volume of water that can be stored in the Colorado River system reservoirs (60 million acre-feet) is enough to cover the State of Utah in about 1 foot of water. Dimensions shown above are not to scale.\n Bureau of Reclamation. Colorado River Basin Supply and Demand Study, 2012. \nDevelopment in the West continues, leading to increased water demand in the Colorado River Basin.\nSince the early 1900s, water demand in the Colorado River Basin has increased while water supply has, on average, decreased. For the 16-year period preceding the signing of the 1922 Colorado River Compact, when the beneficial consumptive use of 7.5 million acre-feet (maf) per year was apportioned to both the Upper and Lower Basins, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 18.0 maf (1906-1921). When the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was executed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 maf (1906-1944). The current average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (1906-2015).  \nAs the average annual natural flow has decreased, the difference between water supply and water demand has narrowed and the Colorado River system has been operating on increasingly close margins. As a result of this decrease in natural flows and an increase in water use basin-wide, it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012).\nClimate projections indicate more extreme conditions are possible, with longer, more severe wet and dry periods. Cooperation and collaboration are key to finding sustainable solutions and addressing current and future water resources management challenges.\nRead More >>\nTrends in water supply and water use in the Colorado River Basin are shown above. When water use (red line) exceeds water supply (blue line) in a given year, the amount of water stored is reduced. During the past 20 years, average water supply and average water use have been about equal. Under these conditions, reservoirs are replenished more slowly. Water-supply and water-use data shown in the graphic above are estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation using water accounting information, U.S. Geological Survey stream gage data, and other sources.\nIn this graphic, water use is shown as \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsumptive use\u00e2\u0080\u009d (surface-water diversions and groundwater pumping minus measured and unmeasured return flows) as estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation in its annual water accounting reports. Other estimates of water use that account for withdrawals of surface and groundwater and incorporate water that is used and returned to the stream, are made by the USGS.\nBureau of Reclamation. 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.\nAccess current reservoir conditions in the Upper Basin and Lower Basin.\nBecause of reduced water supply during the current drought, the elevations of Lakes Mead and Powell have declined.\nAs the reservoir levels of Lake Mead and Lake Powell decline, other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and water quality, are also affected.\nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Powell can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps are based on U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June in 1999 and 2014. Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged together to generate cloud-free composite satellite images suitable for measurement and change comparison.\n\t\t \nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Mead can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps were prepared using the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite data as described in the Lake Powell caption above.   \nBetween 2001 and 2015, Lake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elevation dropped from 1,196 to 1,075 feet, a decline of 121 feet. Move the slider on the upper photo to see the decline in the reservoir elevation during this time. The decline in water elevation has exposed a white band of mineralized rock around the shoreline. The declining reservoir level has also exposed portions of Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four intake towers, two on the right side and two on the left side. These intake towers channel water from Lake Mead into penstocks that serve Hoover Dam's 17 hydroelectric generators. Water moves through the generators, creating electricity on the way, and is released back into the Colorado River below the dam. \nThe lower photos show the conditions of Lake Mead and the upstream face of Hoover Dam in 2001 at an elevation of 1,196 feet (left photo) and the conditions in June 2015 at an elevation of 1,075 feet (right photo). The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts. Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). The Bureau of Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with \u00e2\u0080\u009cwide-head\u00e2\u0080\u009d turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant. \nAt Lake Powell, the generating capacity of the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is put at risk by declining reservoir levels. Below an elevation of 3,490 feet, Glen Canyon Dam cannot generate power. Based on a Bureau of Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest that this elevation is projected to occur would be 2019 (there is about a 5 percent chance of this occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water-surface elevation declined to a maximum low elevation of 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, which was approximately 65 feet above the minimum power pool.\nRead More >>\nThe photo slider above shows Hemenway Harbor, located in the southwestern portion of Lake Mead, and the location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,152 feet in January 2003, and the new location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,078 feet in May 2015. The photos also depict the increased exposure of Lake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoreline and the emergence of the Boulder Islands, located on the right side of the photo, as the reservoir elevation has declined.\nLake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s declining reservoir elevation has affected marinas and boat launching facilities at Lake Mead National Recreation Area, requiring the relocation of marinas and the extension of boat ramps to keep recreational facilities open. To continue to provide boat access as reservoir levels have declined, the National Park Service, responsible for the Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2002 and was expected to about spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2007, the Overton Beach Marina became inaccessible by water, and facilities from Overton Beach had to be moved to two other marinas, Callville Bay and Temple Bar. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s to its current location in Hemenway Harbor.\nIn addition to impacting water supply, changing reservoir levels also influence the aquatic ecosystem. Water-level changes and natural disturbances, such as storm events and resulting local runoff, can re-suspend sediments. Because some Lake Mead sediments contain contaminants, re-suspension of sediment may be of concern to ecological health (Rosen et al., 2012).\nRead More >>\nIllia, T. 2010.

Monthly projections made by the Bureau of Reclamation through an operational model called the \"24-Month Study\" are used to set the operational conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.\nContinue with the visualization to learn more about Lake Mead's operational conditions, how operational conditions are determined, and the potential impacts of drought on water deliveries in the Lower Basin.\nThe graphic above shows Lake Mead's historical elevations (on a monthly basis) since 2000, projected elevations for 2016 and 2017, and annual operating conditions. \nAs Lake Mead's elevation declines, the Lower Basin comes closer to its first-ever shortage condition. Since the drought began in 2000, Lake Mead's elevation has dropped by nearly 140 feet, declining every year except in 2005 and 2011. The Bureau of Reclamation makes projections of Lake Mead elevations and summarizes them in the Colorado River Basin 24-Month Study reports. The 24-Month Study model simulates operations of 12 major reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin. The projections are used to support annual and monthly decisions about how to operate the system looking out 1 to 2 years. The annual operating conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell in the upcoming year are based on projected January 1 reservoir elevations from the August 24-Month Study consistent with the 2007 Record of Decision on Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (2007 Interim Guidelines  ). \nThe 24-Month Study utilizes forecasted Upper Basin inflow hydrology (provided by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center), projected reservoir operations, projected diversion and consumptive use schedules, and other factors, to generate a single scenario of potential reservoir conditions.\nThe 2007 Interim Guidelines, adopted in December 2007 and in effect through 2026, provide the approved procedure to determine operating conditions and annual releases from Lake Powell and Lake Mead throughout the full range of reservoir operations. The 2007 Interim Guidelines include criteria for implementing shortage and surplus conditions in the Lower Colorado River Basin. The January 1 projections and resulting annual operation for Lake Mead and Lake Powell are reported in the Annual Operating Plan for Colorado River Reservoirs (AOP) for the upcoming year. Current and previous years' AOPs can be found on the Bureau of Reclamation's website.\n\nRead More >>\nLake Mead\nThe Colorado River is one of the primary sources of water for irrigation and domestic use in Arizona, southern California, southern Nevada, and portions of northwestern Mexico.\nThe Bureau of Reclamation's Lower Colorado Region keeps records of diversions, return flows, and consumptive use of water delivered from the mainstream of the Colorado River below Lees Ferry to entitlement holders within the Lower Colorado River Basin. \nThe pictogram above depicts average consumptive use by select Lower Colorado River water entitlement holders for the 5-year period from 2010-2014. Each blue block represents a volume of 100,000 acre-feet and partially shaded blue blocks represent volumes less than 100,000 acre-feet. Hover over the bars to see the average consumptive use (2010-2014) by select Lower Colorado River entitlement holders (highlighted in green). \nThe pictogram above depicts the elevation range (from approximately 1,200 to 1,229 feet) and annual water deliveries in the Lower Basin when Lake Mead is operating in a Flood Control Surplus Condition. When in flood control, Lake Mead's operations are coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to the 1984 Field Working Agreement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Per the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, when Lake Mead is operating in flood control, an additional 200,000 acre-feet of water will be delivered to Mexico for a total annual delivery of 1.7 million acre-feet.

Activities related to drought response include a system conservation program and drought contingency planning efforts in both the Upper and Lower Basins. Additional ongoing activities are being conducted with stakeholders through the Basin Study Moving Forward process and with Native American Tribes through the Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study. Lastly, the implementation of Minute 319 and related binational discussions also underscore the importance of the partnership and continued collaboration between the United States and Mexico. \nPilot System Conservation Program\n In 2014, an $11 million funding agreement for a  Pilot System Conservation Program (PSCP) was executed among the Bureau of Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD), The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), Denver Water (DW), and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) (the Funding Partners). The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016. The purpose of the PSCP is to explore the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels. All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water. Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing.\nDrought Contingency Planning\nThe Bureau of Reclamation also works with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead. A step forward was a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a Pilot Drought Response Actions signed by the Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies in the Lower Basin States in December 2014. The MOU outlines a commitment by the parties to use best efforts to generate between 1.5 and 3.0 million acre-feet (maf) of additional water in Lake Mead through 2019. The Bureau of Reclamation, MWD, SNWA, and CAWCD have agreed to take first steps to generate 0.740 maf of the additional water by the end of 2017. The MOU is an important first step forward and collaboration continues on potential longer term options.\nIn the Upper Basin, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming are pursuing a plan with three major components: 1) extended operations of the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) reservoirs, 2) voluntary demand management (e.g., fallowing or deficit irrigation), and 3) augmentation (primarily weather modification, such as cloud seeding). The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the Upper Basin CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Upper Basin States are developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement. It is anticipated that these will be completed by the end of 2016.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned activities, Congress has authorized additional funding through the Bureau of Reclamation for drought-related activities to increase Colorado River system water in Lake Mead, Lake Powell, and other Colorado River system reservoirs for the benefit of the system. This authorization requires that a report evaluating the effectiveness of the water conservation pilot projects be submitted to Congress in 2018, including a recommendation on whether the activities undertaken by the pilot projects should be continued. \nThe Moving Forward Effort\nIn May 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation and Basin stakeholders initiated the Moving Forward effort to build on future considerations and next steps identified in the Colorado River Basin Study. The Moving Forward effort enhances the broad, inclusive stakeholder process demonstrated in the Basin Study with an ultimate goal of identifying actionable steps to address projected water supply and demand imbalances that have broad-based support and provide a wide range of benefits. The Moving Forward effort is being conducted in a phased approach. Phase 1 began with the formation of a Coordination Team and three multi-stakeholder workgroups that focus on water conservation, reuse and environmental and recreational flows. In May, 2015 the Phase 1 Report was published, which documents the activities and outcomes of the workgroups during this phase and includes opportunities for potential future action.  \nTribal Water Study\nBegun in late 2013, the Colorado River Basin Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study is a cooperative effort with the Ten Tribes Partnership, whose members hold a significant amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries. The study builds on the technical foundation of the Colorado River Basin Study by further assessing water supplies and demands for these Tribes and identifies tribal opportunities and challenges associated with the development of tribal water. This study is anticipated to be completed in 2016.\nBinational Partnership\nIn November 2012, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. Minute 319 is a 5-year agreement (2013-2017) that provides for a series of joint cooperative actions between the United States and Mexico, including surplus sharing during higher Lake Mead conditions, reduced water deliveries during lower Lake Mead conditions, flexibility with the Intentionally Created Mexican Apportionment mechanism, opportunities for improved and more efficient infrastructure, and water for the environment. In 2014, a pulse flow of approximately 105,000 acre-feet was delivered to Mexico from March 23 through May 18 to benefit the riparian ecosystem in the Colorado River Delta. Implementation of the pulse flow also involved a monitoring component conducted by scientists and experts from the United States and Mexico to determine the environmental benefits of the pulse flow and the overall performance of the pilot project. With the success of the binational implementation of this project, the United States and Mexico hope to develop a new binational agreement in the spirit of continued collaboration to meet future water resources management challenges ahead. \nRead More >>\nBureau of Reclamation System Conservation Pilot Program.

      "Phoenix and Maricopa County on track to count fewer heat deaths for first time in a decade\nMaricopa County's medical examiner isn't quite done counting heat-related deaths for 2024, but the Department of Public Health told The Arizona Republic this week the totals are likely to come in under that for 2023. It would be the first year in a decade when the number has not increased.\nIn 2023, 645 people died from factors related to environmental heat in Arizona's most populous county, with a majority of those cases determined to have been directly caused by heat. That staggering death toll, which drew international attention to metro Phoenix's record-breaking temperatures due to climate change and urban development, was a 52% increase over the previous year, which was a 25% jump compared to the year before that.\nLast year's heat mortality count was also nearly an eightfold increase over the 84 heat-related deaths in 2015.\n\"This is not yet absolute by any means, but about 75% of the cases that are under investigation are what we estimate will likely be confirmed,\" Dr. Nick Staab, a medical epidemiologist and assistant medical director for the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, told The Republic Tuesday. \"With our update today, that would be around 609 cases, which would be less than the 645 from last year.\"\nThe medical examiner's office changed protocols for flagging deaths under investigation as potentially heat-related in 2023 to address process oversights that may have resulted in undercounts for previous years. But \"nothing has changed for counts of confirmed heat-related deaths,\" chief medical examiner Dr. Jeff Johnston told The Republic on Wednesday, adding that \"comparisons of annual counts of heat-related deaths are reliable and should be comparable to other jurisdictions who are medically investigating such deaths.\"\nThe protocol change reflects a growing awareness nationwide of the deadly consequences of worsening extreme heat. In 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a guidance toolkit for disaster-related medical death investigations that included a form and checklist for heat wave disasters. As some of the hottest urban areas in the country, Maricopa and Pima Counties were already ahead of the curve on these efforts at that point, Johnston said.\nThe CDC still \"does not have any real-time surveillance protocols that we are aware of for such investigations,\" he said, but the agency has praised Maricopa County's heat surveillance efforts, which have helped guide practices in other regions dealing with dangerously rising temperatures, including Miami-Dade County, FL; Harris County, TX; King County, WA; the state of Louisiana; and most recently Los Angeles County.\nMore:In Arizona, a generation fears uncertainties in abortion access and climate action\nThe fact that an increased focus on considering environmental temperatures in death investigations may be offset by fewer heat-caused cases this year also suggests that local programs aimed at stemming health impacts to Arizonans from extreme heat might be working. If the 2024 heat death total bends the skyrocketing trend from recent years downward, as Staab expects, even with changes that might result in more deaths being attributed to heat over the past two years than in previous assessments, it will signify a needed shift many years in the making.\n\u201cThere has been some reporting that maybe we were ahead of last year\u2019s numbers and really we think we will end up very close to last year\u2019s numbers, and maybe just under,\" Staab said. \"We\u2019re at a point where we feel like what we\u2019re doing in public health is working because we\u2019ve all seen in the last couple of years this kind of persistent climb upwards. We really want to see that number significantly lower because, as we have always said, we do believe all these deaths are preventable.\"\nPhoenix cites 20% fewer heat-related illness emergency calls in 2024\nThough Phoenix officials also do not yet have a confirmed 2024 heat-related death count, they, too, cited measurable progress this week on addressing the human toll of extreme heat.\n\"When we look at the number of heat-related emergencies that our firefighters are dealing with, we saw a 20% reduction when compared to the same period last year,\" Phoenix's executive assistant fire chief Tim Kreis told reporters at a news briefing Thursday.\nEven with that decrease, firefighters still responded to 1,416 heat-related calls for service between May 1 and October 1, during which time fire and emergency management staff used ice-filled cooling bags to quickly reduce dangerously high body temperatures of patients more than 300 times.\nSo far in 2024, the county medical examiner has determined that 240 people died from heat-related causes within Phoenix city limits, 83% of whom were exposed to dangerous temperatures outdoors. In 2023, a total of 340 people succumbed to heat in Phoenix, with 79% of cases originating in outdoor settings.\nThe slight drop in likely totals for 2024 and shift to outdoor risks highlights both Phoenix's challenges with keeping its large unhoused population safe from extreme heat and its successes in making some headway indoors. Access to cooled spaces for unhoused people and programs to check on indoor residents who may be at risk of heat impacts, like elderly and low-income families who may not have or use air conditioning at home, seem to be helping.\nDave Hondula, who directs Phoenix\u2019s Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, told The Republic last year that he makes many of the calls to check on vulnerable residents signed up with the city's \"Cool Callers\" program during heat waves himself. He attributed this year's incremental gains to improved coordination between members of the county's regional Heat Relief Network. One stat he shared Thursday was that his office had distributed one million water bottles to network partners this summer to facilitate regional cooling hydration.\n\u201cAlthough we had a record number of heat records this summer, I\u2019m very confident there\u2019s been a significant and positive public health impact from this heat relief work,\" Hondula said Thursday. \"Lives were saved and lives were changed.\u201d\u00a0\nMore:In a heat wave, some people wait too long to turn on the AC. Smart data use could help\nMayor Kate Gallego also attributed progress on heat initiatives to collaborative action between Hondula's team and the city's Offices of Homeless Solutions, Public Health, Emergency Management and the Fire Department.\nThis year, these efforts included: expanding a network of more than sixty cooling centers and hydration stations; extending hours at certain respite centers to include overnight access; providing transitional shelter space cooled using solar-generated power; the phased opening of the new \"Phoenix Navigation Center\" homeless shelter that was controversial with nearby residents; and managing the \"Safe Outdoor Space\" campground with basic services.\nIn March, the Phoenix City Council passed an ordinance to shield city-contracted workers from extreme heat, in contrast with delayed action on worker protections by the state and nationwide. Throughout the summer, the city also distributed heat relief supplies and grant funding originating from $1.8 million in federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, $500,000 from the state and $1.6 million from the county, Gallego said on Thursday.\nMore:Arizona workers one step closer to extreme heat protections with proposed Biden rules\n'The weather is not working in our favor'\nAmid these indications of progress, speakers at Thursday's city news briefing and at the Maricopa County Department of Public Health underscored that more must be done to address the hundreds of preventable heat deaths that occur locally each year.\n\u201cAcross our state, we have to treat extreme heat as a public health hazard, just like other states and communities have to prepare for harsh weather such as blizzards, hurricanes, and flooding,\u201d Gallego said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need other levels of government to provide additional resources and support to this cause. Our summers are only growing hotter and more intense, and it\u2019s past due that we treat heat like the emergency it is.\u201d \u00a0\nOne way this must happen, scientists say, is through action to address the warming influences of climate change. Burning fossil fuels for energy releases molecules into the air known as greenhouse gases, the most common of which is carbon dioxide. There, they absorb heat from the sun and alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere, which scientists have consistently concluded leads directly to more chaotic and extreme storms, drought and heat waves.\nThe destruction wrought by the most major of these \"not-so-natural\" disasters has already cost the American economy more than $61 billion in 2024, a figure that doesn't include extreme heat events and may triple after the price tags of supercharged Hurricanes Helene and Milton are confirmed. Grocery bills are also spiking in response to crop losses caused by drought and rising temperatures.\nA climate action progress report recently published by Gallego's team tracks Phoenix's recent efforts to address this root cause. But the global problem is exacerbated by other leaders, like members of the Arizona Legislature who have not engaged with climate-based solutions to heat illness and inflation. The most obvious of those solutions, experts say, is to shift energy use to clean and renewable sources. In the past two years, Arizona's solar, battery storage and electric vehicle industries have leveraged nearly $12 billion in investments and more than 18,000 jobs facilitated by President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act toward this goal, though increases in energy demand threaten overall progress.\nMore:In its first climate plan report card, Phoenix claims some progress, with work still to do\nPolitics could also play a role in how Maricopa County's scientists are able to track and study the environmental causes of local heat-related deaths. Staab of the County's Public Health Department told The Republic that insight into heat health impacts has benefitted from the use of publicly available data from the National Weather Service.\n\u201cWith data sources expanding so much, our (epidemiologists) are looking at National Weather Service data and all sorts of stuff to bring into our analysis and that power communicating it out,\" Staab said.\nThat data source has been targeted by the Project 2025 agenda for a second Donald Trump administration. While Trump has distanced himself from this 900-page plan to dismantle many federal and scientific agencies and environmental protections, its creation by members of his prior administration leads many to believe he would enact many of its suggestions, complicating Arizona's efforts to study and address heat-caused deaths.\n\u201cThere is an obvious benefit to having a public, reliable National Weather Service that is funded collectively by taxpayer dollars,\" David Kieve, president of Environmental Defense Fund Action, told The Republic in August. \"The idea that you\u2019re going to privatize that and it will run better as a private business, that\u2019s not going to work. And it\u2019s not going to work for Arizonans at a time when we\u2019re seeing a rising number of extraordinarily hot days.\"\nMore:Climate was barely mentioned in the debate, but Harris and Trump showed wide differences\nRising average temperatures and increasingly frequent extreme heat waves are, Staab also noted, not the only contributors to deaths coded by the medical examiner as heat-related. Drug use, particularly meth, is a growing problem in Phoenix and can \"shut down the body's heat defense system,\" according to reporting by The Republic this summer.\n\u201cWe continue to see a lot of our heat-related deaths amongst those who are unsheltered and those who are using substances, whether that\u2019s drugs or alcohol,\" Staab said. \"As we move forward in our efforts to reach these individuals, we need to focus on partnering with community-based organizations working with those high-risk communities.\"\nAt Thursday's heat relief briefing, Rachel Milne, director of Phoenix's Office of Homeless Solutions, highlighted efforts the city has made to \"help individuals connect with resources beyond heat relief, like housing or shelter.\" Data from the Heat Relief Network showed that 92% of more than 35,000 visitors to cooling centers during summer 2024 reported they were experiencing homelessness. More than 1,000 of them then received direct onsite assistance from Community Bridges Inc, a partner organization working with Milne.\nRead our climate series:The latest from Joan Meiners at azcentral on climate change\nBut while the progress made in 2024 to reduce preventable heat deaths \u2014 through the smart use of data sources, the application of federal, state and county funding, the body bags of ice, the heat-aware changes to medical examining protocols and more \u2014 is promising and inspiring and likely saved lives, innumerable more water bottles, cooling centers and heat ordinances may be needed if climate change is not brought under control.\n\u201cThe weather is not working in our favor,\u201d Staab said.\nJoan Meiners is the climate news and storytelling reporter at The Arizona Republic and\u00a0azcentral.com.

Over the past 12 months, the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate in 5 months, matched the median estimate in 2 months, and fallen short of the median estimate in 5 months. It is interesting to note that actual CPI number has been below the estimate over the past four months (May 2024 through August 2024). Over the past 5 years (60 months), the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate 52% of the time, matched the median estimate 15% of the time, and fallen short of the median estimate 33% of the time.\nThe median estimate of 2.3% is based on 17 estimates collected by FactSet. These CPI estimates range from a low of 2.20% to a high of 2.40%, for a spread of 20 bps. This spread is smaller than the trailing 12-month average spread between the low and high estimate of 27 bps and smaller than the 5-year (60 month) average spread between the low and high estimate 49 bps.\nThe median estimate (year-over-year, not seasonally adjusted) for the consumer price index excluding food & energy (Core CPI) is 3.2%.\nTomorrow (October 10) the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the CPI and Core CPI numbers for September.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis blog post is for informational purposes only.

Over the past 12 months, the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate in 5 months, matched the median estimate in 2 months, and fallen short of the median estimate in 5 months. It is interesting to note that actual CPI number has been below the estimate over the past four months (May 2024 through August 2024). Over the past 5 years (60 months), the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate 52% of the time, matched the median estimate 15% of the time, and fallen short of the median estimate 33% of the time.\nThe median estimate of 2.3% is based on 17 estimates collected by FactSet. These CPI estimates range from a low of 2.20% to a high of 2.40%, for a spread of 20 bps. This spread is smaller than the trailing 12-month average spread between the low and high estimate of 27 bps and smaller than the 5-year (60 month) average spread between the low and high estimate 49 bps.\nThe median estimate (year-over-year, not seasonally adjusted) for the consumer price index excluding food & energy (Core CPI) is 3.2%.\nTomorrow (October 10) the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the CPI and Core CPI numbers for September.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis blog post is for informational purposes only.

Police find a homeless woman dead on the sidewalk,\u201d the news anchor said.  \nAt this, Howard dropped what he was doing and hurried closer to the TV. \n\u201cThe cause is believed to be from the extreme heat.\u201d \nHoward knew that was likely because a high-pressure system known as a heat dome had recently moved over South Texas. The meteorological phenomenon acts like a closed oven door, trapping a roiling mass of hot air below. The official temperature that day had reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41\u00b0C) \u2013 12 degrees higher than average for that date. The dead woman was later identified as 46-year-old Jessica Witzel.\nAlthough Howard didn\u2019t know her, Witzel\u2019s death hit him hard.\n\u201cIt was right here in San Antonio,\u201d he said. \u201cA specific person gives the numbers a name and a face.\u201d\nHoward is a numbers guy by profession. An associate professor of public health at the University of Texas at San Antonio \u2013 a 15-minute drive from where Witzel died \u2013 Howard specializes in using large data sets to understand acute and long-term health consequences from exposure to traumas of all sorts. \nHeat-related deaths were already uppermost on his mind that evening. He was the lead author of a study about to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cTrends of Heat-Related Deaths in the US, 1999\u20132023\u201d was the first scientific paper to document an abrupt, steep rise in heat-related deaths across the country, one that is likely linked to climate change.\nThe study found that between 1999 and 2023, the heat-related mortality rate \u2013 the number of deaths per 100,000 people \u2013 rose by 63%. But the data showed something even more disturbing: The trend is rapidly accelerating. \n\u201cThe death rate,\u201d Howard said, \u201chas risen 117% in the last seven years.\u201d\nSara Meerow is an urban heat expert at Arizona State University in Tempe, a city just to the east of Phoenix in Maricopa County. Last year, 645 heat-related deaths were recorded in the county. Heat deaths have long been considered a problem largely confined to the Phoenix metro area, Meerow said.  \nBut Howard\u2019s research \u201csuggests that increases in the number of heat-related deaths over the past few years in Phoenix, Arizona, are part of a national trend,\u201d she said.\nThe climate is changing, and our journalists are here to help you make sense of it. Sign up for our weekly email newsletter and never miss a story.\nMeerow, an associate professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at ASU, was herself the lead author of a journal article published only days before Howard\u2019s. Hers looked at what officials are doing \u2013 and failing to do \u2013 to reduce heat-related deaths in the U.S.\nAlthough heat kills more U.S. residents than any other form of extreme weather, Meerow pointed out that \u201ccompared with other hazards like flooding, heat is less visible and largely unregulated.\u201d\nFor example, Meerow noted in the paper, the federal government maps flood zones, builds levees, subsidizes flood insurance, and provides financial and other aid to people who have suffered a flooding disaster. But there are no similar measures to help U.S. residents likely to experience deadly heat waves.\nJessica Witzel\u2019s death is a tragically typical example of how officials at all levels of government are failing to protect Americans from extreme heat.\nWitzel was unhoused and had been diagnosed with severe mental disorders. Living on the street, without access to a cool shelter, people are far more likely to suffer heat-related illnesses, from temporary heat cramps to potentially lethal heat stroke. Mental disorders can interfere with a person\u2019s ability to recognize when their body temperature is rising to dangerous levels. In rural and urban America, there is a chronic shortage of shelter beds for unhoused people, air-conditioned spaces that are open to the public when needed, and mental health care for vulnerable populations that can\u2019t afford health insurance.\nRead: For unhoused people in America\u2019s hottest large city, heat waves are a merciless killer\nWitzel died at what could be considered ground zero in San Antonio\u2019s urban heat island, where the combination of vast stretches of concrete and lack of vegetation and shade sends already high temperatures skyrocketing. Waste heat from gas-powered vehicles is a significant contributor to urban heat islands, and Interstate 10 is less than 1,000 feet south of where Witzel was found. To the north, and even closer, is an enormous concrete parking lot servicing the city\u2019s 500-bus transit system.\nExactly how hot it was at the time and place Witzel was found isn\u2019t known, but Greg Harman has a pretty good idea. Harman is the founder of Deceleration, a nonprofit online journal in San Antonio that describes its beat as \u201cthe intersection of environment and justice.\u201d During the scorching San Antonio summers, Harman travels to different neighborhoods to document and write about the disparate impact of heat on residents based on location.\nThe day before Witzel died, Harman had used an extremely accurate tool to measure the temperature and humidity in downtown San Antonio. The official high that day was 108 degrees (42\u00b0C), but that reading was taken at the airport, several miles from the city\u2019s hotter urban core.\n\u201cDowntown, the air temperature was 119 degrees [48\u00b0C],\u201d Harman said. \u201cThe heat index, which combines heat and humidity to determine how hot it feels to the human body, was 129 degrees [54\u00b0C].\u201d\nWitzel\u2019s death also underscores what experts agree is a fundamental problem in working to reduce heat mortalities.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades that the official numbers of heat-related deaths are massive underestimates,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, professor of global health at the University of Washington. Without knowing the true size and other details of the problem, she added, it\u2019s hard to set priorities for action.\nEbi pointed to several factors that lead to these undercounts, beginning with the fact that there is no nationwide standard for reporting heat deaths. Bexar County, Texas, for example, which includes San Antonio, doesn\u2019t track deaths caused by heat, which means that Witzel is unlikely to be included in state or national counts of heat mortalities, regardless of what cause of death is listed on her death certificate.\nWhich points to another problem: Death certificates are not necessarily reliable indicators of heat deaths.\n\u201cExtreme heat can cause a heart attack,\u201d Ebi explained. \u201cIf somebody comes into an emergency room having a heart attack, the people working there may not know whether the person had been exposed to extreme heat.\u201d \nIf the patient dies, the cause of death is recorded simply as a heart attack.\nAnother reason a death certificate may not mention heat is that there\u2019s no state or federal standard for who can issue death certificates.\nRead: Climate change played a role in killing tens of thousands of people in 2023 \nIn Texas, large metropolitan areas are likely to have professional medical examiners. \u201cBut in smaller cities and in rural areas,\u201d Howard said, \u201cthe person filling out the death certificate might be a justice of the peace who has no medical training at all.\u201d\nThat may partly explain why metro Phoenix reports such a disproportionately large share of heat deaths (in addition to its being a sprawling, car-centric desert city).\n\u201cThe medical examiner\u2019s office in Phoenix has a rigorous protocol in place for determining heat-related deaths,\u201d Howard said. \nSimply put, if you\u2019re actively looking for heat-related deaths, you\u2019ll likely get a more accurate count than if you\u2019re not looking. Given the precipitous rise in heat deaths across the country documented in Howard\u2019s study, he believes getting a more accurate count is vital to taking action to save lives.\n\u201cGoing forward,\u201d Howard said, \u201cthere should be a much more concerted effort nationally around developing protocols and processes that are more standardized for assessing heat-related deaths.\u201d\nAt a vigil for Jessica Witzel held days after her death, one of her childhood friends put it succinctly. Standing under an umbrella against the intense Texas sunlight, Marisol Cortez, who also co-edits Deceleration, spoke to the small group of family and friends gathered near the spot where Witzel had died.\nShe directed these words to government officials.\n\u201cCount the bodies!\u201d Witzel\u2019s friend demanded.\nWe help millions of people understand climate change and what to do about it.

Police find a homeless woman dead on the sidewalk,\u201d the news anchor said.  \nAt this, Howard dropped what he was doing and hurried closer to the TV. \n\u201cThe cause is believed to be from the extreme heat.\u201d \nHoward knew that was likely because a high-pressure system known as a heat dome had recently moved over South Texas. The meteorological phenomenon acts like a closed oven door, trapping a roiling mass of hot air below. The official temperature that day had reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41\u00b0C) \u2013 12 degrees higher than average for that date. The dead woman was later identified as 46-year-old Jessica Witzel.\nAlthough Howard didn\u2019t know her, Witzel\u2019s death hit him hard.\n\u201cIt was right here in San Antonio,\u201d he said. \u201cA specific person gives the numbers a name and a face.\u201d\nHoward is a numbers guy by profession. An associate professor of public health at the University of Texas at San Antonio \u2013 a 15-minute drive from where Witzel died \u2013 Howard specializes in using large data sets to understand acute and long-term health consequences from exposure to traumas of all sorts. \nHeat-related deaths were already uppermost on his mind that evening. He was the lead author of a study about to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cTrends of Heat-Related Deaths in the US, 1999\u20132023\u201d was the first scientific paper to document an abrupt, steep rise in heat-related deaths across the country, one that is likely linked to climate change.\nThe study found that between 1999 and 2023, the heat-related mortality rate \u2013 the number of deaths per 100,000 people \u2013 rose by 63%. But the data showed something even more disturbing: The trend is rapidly accelerating. \n\u201cThe death rate,\u201d Howard said, \u201chas risen 117% in the last seven years.\u201d\nSara Meerow is an urban heat expert at Arizona State University in Tempe, a city just to the east of Phoenix in Maricopa County. Last year, 645 heat-related deaths were recorded in the county. Heat deaths have long been considered a problem largely confined to the Phoenix metro area, Meerow said.  \nBut Howard\u2019s research \u201csuggests that increases in the number of heat-related deaths over the past few years in Phoenix, Arizona, are part of a national trend,\u201d she said.\nThe climate is changing, and our journalists are here to help you make sense of it. Sign up for our weekly email newsletter and never miss a story.\nMeerow, an associate professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at ASU, was herself the lead author of a journal article published only days before Howard\u2019s. Hers looked at what officials are doing \u2013 and failing to do \u2013 to reduce heat-related deaths in the U.S.\nAlthough heat kills more U.S. residents than any other form of extreme weather, Meerow pointed out that \u201ccompared with other hazards like flooding, heat is less visible and largely unregulated.\u201d\nFor example, Meerow noted in the paper, the federal government maps flood zones, builds levees, subsidizes flood insurance, and provides financial and other aid to people who have suffered a flooding disaster. But there are no similar measures to help U.S. residents likely to experience deadly heat waves.\nJessica Witzel\u2019s death is a tragically typical example of how officials at all levels of government are failing to protect Americans from extreme heat.\nWitzel was unhoused and had been diagnosed with severe mental disorders. Living on the street, without access to a cool shelter, people are far more likely to suffer heat-related illnesses, from temporary heat cramps to potentially lethal heat stroke. Mental disorders can interfere with a person\u2019s ability to recognize when their body temperature is rising to dangerous levels. In rural and urban America, there is a chronic shortage of shelter beds for unhoused people, air-conditioned spaces that are open to the public when needed, and mental health care for vulnerable populations that can\u2019t afford health insurance.\nRead: For unhoused people in America\u2019s hottest large city, heat waves are a merciless killer\nWitzel died at what could be considered ground zero in San Antonio\u2019s urban heat island, where the combination of vast stretches of concrete and lack of vegetation and shade sends already high temperatures skyrocketing. Waste heat from gas-powered vehicles is a significant contributor to urban heat islands, and Interstate 10 is less than 1,000 feet south of where Witzel was found. To the north, and even closer, is an enormous concrete parking lot servicing the city\u2019s 500-bus transit system.\nExactly how hot it was at the time and place Witzel was found isn\u2019t known, but Greg Harman has a pretty good idea. Harman is the founder of Deceleration, a nonprofit online journal in San Antonio that describes its beat as \u201cthe intersection of environment and justice.\u201d During the scorching San Antonio summers, Harman travels to different neighborhoods to document and write about the disparate impact of heat on residents based on location.\nThe day before Witzel died, Harman had used an extremely accurate tool to measure the temperature and humidity in downtown San Antonio. The official high that day was 108 degrees (42\u00b0C), but that reading was taken at the airport, several miles from the city\u2019s hotter urban core.\n\u201cDowntown, the air temperature was 119 degrees [48\u00b0C],\u201d Harman said. \u201cThe heat index, which combines heat and humidity to determine how hot it feels to the human body, was 129 degrees [54\u00b0C].\u201d\nWitzel\u2019s death also underscores what experts agree is a fundamental problem in working to reduce heat mortalities.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades that the official numbers of heat-related deaths are massive underestimates,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, professor of global health at the University of Washington. Without knowing the true size and other details of the problem, she added, it\u2019s hard to set priorities for action.\nEbi pointed to several factors that lead to these undercounts, beginning with the fact that there is no nationwide standard for reporting heat deaths. Bexar County, Texas, for example, which includes San Antonio, doesn\u2019t track deaths caused by heat, which means that Witzel is unlikely to be included in state or national counts of heat mortalities, regardless of what cause of death is listed on her death certificate.\nWhich points to another problem: Death certificates are not necessarily reliable indicators of heat deaths.\n\u201cExtreme heat can cause a heart attack,\u201d Ebi explained. \u201cIf somebody comes into an emergency room having a heart attack, the people working there may not know whether the person had been exposed to extreme heat.\u201d \nIf the patient dies, the cause of death is recorded simply as a heart attack.\nAnother reason a death certificate may not mention heat is that there\u2019s no state or federal standard for who can issue death certificates.\nRead: Climate change played a role in killing tens of thousands of people in 2023 \nIn Texas, large metropolitan areas are likely to have professional medical examiners. \u201cBut in smaller cities and in rural areas,\u201d Howard said, \u201cthe person filling out the death certificate might be a justice of the peace who has no medical training at all.\u201d\nThat may partly explain why metro Phoenix reports such a disproportionately large share of heat deaths (in addition to its being a sprawling, car-centric desert city).\n\u201cThe medical examiner\u2019s office in Phoenix has a rigorous protocol in place for determining heat-related deaths,\u201d Howard said. \nSimply put, if you\u2019re actively looking for heat-related deaths, you\u2019ll likely get a more accurate count than if you\u2019re not looking. Given the precipitous rise in heat deaths across the country documented in Howard\u2019s study, he believes getting a more accurate count is vital to taking action to save lives.\n\u201cGoing forward,\u201d Howard said, \u201cthere should be a much more concerted effort nationally around developing protocols and processes that are more standardized for assessing heat-related deaths.\u201d\nAt a vigil for Jessica Witzel held days after her death, one of her childhood friends put it succinctly. Standing under an umbrella against the intense Texas sunlight, Marisol Cortez, who also co-edits Deceleration, spoke to the small group of family and friends gathered near the spot where Witzel had died.\nShe directed these words to government officials.\n\u201cCount the bodies!\u201d Witzel\u2019s friend demanded.\nWe help millions of people understand climate change and what to do about it.

See Guide to this Report for more on\nassessments of likelihood and confidence.\n6.0: Introduction\nTemperature is among the most important climatic elements used in\ndecision-making. For example, builders and insurers use temperature\ndata for planning and risk management while energy companies and\nregulators use temperature data to predict demand and set utility\nrates. Temperature is also a key indicator of climate change: recent\nincreases are apparent over the land, ocean, and troposphere, and\nsubstantial changes are expected for this century. This chapter\nsummarizes the major observed and projected changes in near-surface\nair temperature over the United States, emphasizing new data sets\nand model projections since the Third National Climate Assessment\n(NCA3). Changes are depicted using a spectrum of observations,\nincluding surface weather stations, moored ocean buoys, polar-orbiting\nsatellites, and temperature-sensitive proxies. Projections are based\non global models and downscaled products from CMIP5 (Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5) using a suite of Representative\nConcentration Pathways (RCPs; see Ch. 4: Projections for more on\nRCPs and future scenarios).\n6.1: Historical Changes\n6.1.1 Average Temperatures\nChanges in average temperature are described using a suite of\nobservational datasets. As in NCA3, changes in land temperature are\nassessed using the nClimGrid dataset.1\n,2\nAlong U.S. coastlines,\nchanges in sea surface temperatures are quantified using a new\nreconstruction3\nthat forms the ocean component of the NOAA Global Temperature\ndataset.4\nChanges in middle tropospheric temperature are examined using updated\nversions of multiple satellite datasets.5\n,6\n,7\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States has\nrisen since the start of the 20th century. In general, temperature\nincreased until about 1940, decreased until about 1970, and increased\nrapidly through 2016. Because the increase was not constant over\ntime, multiple methods were evaluated in this report (as in NCA3)\nto quantify the trend. All methods yielded rates of warming that\nwere significant at the 95% level. The lowest estimate of 1.2\u00b0F\n(0.7\u00b0C) was obtained by computing the difference between the average\nfor 1986\u20132016 (i.e., present-day) and the average for 1901\u20131960\n(i.e., the first half of the last century). The highest estimate\nof 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) was obtained by fitting a linear (least-squares)\nregression line through the period 1895\u20132016. Thus, the temperature\nincrease cited in this assessment is 1.2\u00b0\u20131.8\u00b0F (0.7\u00b0\u20131.0\u00b0C).\nThis increase is about 0.1\u00b0F (0.06\u00b0C) less than presented in NCA3,\nand it results from the use of slightly different periods in each\nreport. In particular, the decline in the lower bound stems from\nthe use of different time periods to represent present-day climate\n(NCA3 used 1991\u20132012, which was slightly warmer than the 1986\u20132016\nperiod used here). The decline in the upper bound stems mainly from\ntemperature differences late in the record (e.g., the last year of\ndata available for NCA3 was 2012, which was the warmest year on\nrecord for the contiguous United States).\nEach NCA region experienced a net warming through 2016 (Table 6.1).\nThe largest changes were in the western United States, where average\ntemperature increased by more than 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in Alaska, the\nNorthwest, the Southwest, and also in the Northern Great Plains.\nAs noted in NCA3, the Southeast had the least warming, driven by a\ncombination of natural variations and human influences.8\nIn most regions, average\nminimum temperature increased at a slightly higher rate than average\nmaximum temperature, with the Midwest having the largest discrepancy,\nand the Southwest and Northwest having the smallest. This differential\nrate of warming resulted in a continuing decrease in the diurnal\ntemperature range that is consistent with other parts of the globe.9\nAnnual average\nsea surface temperature also increased along all regional coastlines\n(see Figure 1.3), though changes were generally smaller than over\nland owing to the higher heat capacity of water. Increases were\nlargest in Alaska (greater than 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]) while increases\nwere smallest (less than 0.5\u00b0F [0.3\u00b0C]) in coastal areas of the\nSoutheast.\nMore than 95% of the land surface of the contiguous United States\nhad an increase in annual average temperature (Figure 6.1). In\ncontrast, only small (and somewhat dispersed) parts of the Southeast\nand Southern Great Plains experienced cooling. From a seasonal\nperspective, warming was greatest and most widespread in winter,\nwith increases of over 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in most areas. In summer,\nwarming was less extensive (mainly along the East Coast and in the\nwestern third of the Nation), while cooling was evident in parts\nof the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains.\nFigure 6.1\nObserved changes in annual, winter, and summer temperature (\u00b0F). Changes are the difference\nbetween the average for present-day (1986\u20132016) and the average for the first half of\nthe last century (1901\u20131960 for the contiguous United States, 1925\u20131960 for Alaska and Hawai\u2018i).\nEstimates are derived from the nClimDiv dataset.\n1\n,2\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nThere has been a rapid increase in the average temperature of the\ncontiguous United States over the past several decades. There is\ngeneral consistency on this point between the surface thermometer\nrecord from NOAA1\nand the middle tropospheric satellite records from Remote Sensing\nSystems (RSS),5\nNOAA\u2019s Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR),7\nand the University\nof Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).6\nIn particular, for the\nperiod 1979\u20132016, the rate of warming in the surface record was\n0.512\u00b0F (0.284\u00b0C) per decade, versus trends of 0.455\u00b0F (0.253\u00b0C),\n0.421\u00b0F (0.234\u00b0C), and 0.289\u00b0F (0.160 \u00b0C) per decade for RSS version\n4, STAR version 3, and UAH version 6, respectively (after accounting\nfor stratospheric influences). All trends are statistically significant\nat the 95% level. For the contiguous United States, the year 2016\nwas the second-warmest on record at the surface and in the middle\ntroposphere (2012 was the warmest year at the surface, and 2015 was\nthe warmest in the middle troposphere). Generally speaking, surface\nand satellite records do not have identical trends because they do\nnot represent the same physical quantity; surface measurements are\nmade using thermometers in shelters about 1.5 meters above the\nground whereas satellite measurements are mass-weighted averages\nof microwave emissions from deep atmospheric layers. The UAH record\nlikely has a lower trend because it differs from the other satellite\nproducts in the treatment of target temperatures from the NOAA-9\nsatellite as well as in the correction for diurnal drift.10\nRecent paleo-temperature evidence confirms the unusual character\nof wide-scale warming during the past few decades as determined\nfrom the instrumental record. The most important new paleoclimate\nstudy since NCA3 showed that for each of the seven continental\nregions, the reconstructed area-weighted average temperature for\n1971\u20132000 was higher than for any other time in nearly 1,400 years,11\nalthough with\nsignificant uncertainty around the central estimate that leads to\nthis conclusion. Recent (up to 2006) 30-year smoothed temperatures\nacross temperate North America (including most of the continental\nUnited States) are similarly reconstructed as the warmest over the\npast 1,500 years12\n(Figure 6.2). Unlike the PAGES 2k seven-continent result mentioned\nabove, this conclusion for North America is robust in relation to\nthe estimated uncertainty range. Reconstruction data since 1500 for\nwestern temperate North America show the same conclusion at the\nannual time scale for 1986\u20132005. This time period and the running\n20-year periods thereafter are warmer than all possible continuous\n20-year sequences in a 1,000-member statistical reconstruction\nensemble.13\n6.1.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.2\nPollen-based temperature reconstruction for temperate North America.\nThe blue curve depicts the pollen-based reconstruction of 30-year\naverages (as anomalies from 1904 to 1980) for the temperate region\n(30\u00b0\u201355\u00b0N, 75\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0W). The red curve shows the corresponding tree\nring-based decadal average reconstruction, which was smoothed and\nused to calibrate the lower-frequency pollen-based estimate. Light\n(medium) blue zones indicate 2 standard error (1 standard error)\nuncertainty estimations associated with each 30-year value. The\nblack curve shows comparably smoothed instrumental temperature\nvalues up to 1980. The dashed black line represents the average\ntemperature anomaly of comparably smoothed instrumental data for\nthe period 2000\u20132006. (Figure source: NOAA NCEI).\nShifts in temperature extremes are examined using a suite of\nsocietally relevant climate change indices14\n,15\nderived from long-term\nobservations of daily surface temperature.16\nThe coldest and warmest\ntemperatures of the year are of particular relevance given their\nwidespread use in engineering, agricultural, and other sectoral\napplications (for example, extreme annual design conditions by the\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning;\nplant hardiness zones by the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Cold\nwaves and heat waves (that is, extended periods of below or above\nnormal temperature) are likewise of great importance because of\ntheir numerous societal and environmental impacts, which span from\nhuman health to plant and animal phenology. Changes are considered\nfor a spectrum of event frequencies and intensities, ranging from\nthe typical annual extreme to the 1-in-10 year event (an extreme\nthat only has a 10% chance of occurrence in any given year). The\ndiscussion focuses on the contiguous United States; Alaska, Hawai\u2018i,\nand the Caribbean do not have a sufficient number of long-term\nstations for a century-scale analysis.\nCold extremes have become less severe over the past century. For\nexample, the coldest daily temperature of the year has increased\nat most locations in the contiguous United States (Figure 6.3). All\nregions experienced net increases (Table 6.2), with the largest\nrises in the Northern Great Plains and the Northwest (roughly 4.5\u00b0F\n[2.5\u00b0C]), and the smallest in the Southeast (about 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]).\nIn general, there were increases throughout the record, with a\nslight acceleration in recent decades (Figure 6.3). The temperature\nof extremely cold days (1-in-10 year events) generally exhibited\nthe same pattern of increases as the coldest daily temperature of\nthe year. Consistent with these increases, the number of cool nights\nper year (those with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile\nfor 1961\u20131990) declined in all regions, with much of the West having\ndecreases of roughly two weeks. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile for\n1961\u20131990) has fallen over the past century (Figure 6.4). The\nfrequency of intense cold waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) peaked\nin the 1980s and then reached record-low levels in the 2000s.17\nFigure 6.3\nObserved changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures (\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States.\nMaps (top) depict changes at stations; changes are the difference between the average for present-day (1986\u20132016)\nand the average for the first half of the last century (1901\u20131960). Time series (bottom) depict the area-weighted\naverage for the contiguous United States. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with minimal missing data\nin the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily dataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nFigure 6.4\nObserved changes in cold and heat waves in the contiguous United States. The top panel depicts changes\nin the frequency of cold waves; the middle panel depicts changes in the frequency of heat waves; and the\nbottom panel depicts changes in the intensity of heat waves. Cold and heat wave frequency indices are\ndefined in Zhang et al.,15\nand the heat wave\nintensity index is defined in Russo et al.14\nEstimates are\nderived from long-term stations with minimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in warm extremes are more nuanced than changes in cold\nextremes. For instance, the warmest daily temperature of the year\nincreased in some parts of the West over the past century (Figure\n6.3), but there were decreases in almost all locations east of the\nRocky Mountains. In fact, all eastern regions experienced a net\ndecrease (Table 6.2), most notably the Midwest (about 2.2\u00b0F [1.2\u00b0C])\nand the Southeast (roughly 1.5\u00b0F [0.8\u00b0C]). The decreases in the\neastern half of Nation, particularly in the Great Plains, are mainly\ntied to the unprecedented summer heat of the 1930s Dust Bowl era,\nwhich was exacerbated by land-surface feedbacks driven by springtime\nprecipitation deficits and land mismanagement.18\nHowever, anthropogenic\naerosol forcing may also have reduced summer temperatures in the\nNortheast and Southeast from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s,19\nand agricultural\nintensification may have suppressed the hottest extremes in the\nMidwest.20\nSince the mid-1960s, there has been only a very slight increase in\nthe warmest daily temperature of the year (amidst large interannual\nvariability). Heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile for 1961\u20131990) increased in frequency\nuntil the mid-1930s, became considerably less common through the\nmid-1960s, and increased in frequency again thereafter (Figure 6.4).\nAs with warm daily temperatures, heat wave magnitude reached a\nmaximum in the 1930s. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day,\n1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most\nregions except the Midwest and the Great Plains.17\n,21\nSince the early 1980s\n(Figure 6.4), there is suggestive evidence of a slight increase in\nthe intensity of heat waves nationwide14\nas well as an increase\nin the concurrence of droughts and heat waves.22\nFigure 6.5\nObserved changes in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures\nin the contiguous United States. Red bars indicate a year with more\ndaily record highs than daily record lows, while blue bars indicate\na year with more record lows than highs. The height of the bar\nindicates the ratio of record highs to lows (red) or of record lows\nto highs (blue). For example, a ratio of 2:1 for a blue bar means\nthat there were twice as many record daily lows as daily record\nhighs that year. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with\nminimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures are\nalso apparent. Very generally, the number of record lows has been\ndeclining since the late-1970s while the number of record highs has\nbeen rising.23\nBy extension, there has been an increase in the ratio of the\nnumber of record highs to record lows (Figure 6.5). Over the past\ntwo decades, the average of this ratio exceeds two (meaning that\ntwice as many high-temperature records have been set as low-temperature\nrecords). The number of new highs has surpassed the number of new\nlows in 15 of the last 20 years, with 2012 and 2016 being particularly\nextreme (ratios of seven and five, respectively).\n6.2: Detection and Attribution\n6.2.1\nAverage Temperatures\nWhile a confident attribution of global temperature increases to\nanthropogenic forcing has been made,24\ndetection and attribution\nassessment statements for smaller regions are generally much weaker.\nNevertheless, some detectable anthropogenic influences on average\ntemperature have been reported for North America and parts of the\nUnited States (e.g., Christidis et al. 2010;25\nBonfils et al. 2008;26\nPierce et al.\n200927\n).\nFigure 6.6 shows an example for linear trends for 1901\u20132015,\nindicating a detectable anthropogenic warming since 1901 over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States for\nthe CMIP5 multimodel ensemble\u2014a condition that was also met for\nmost of the individual models.28\nThe Southeast stands out\nas the only region with no \u201cdetectable\u201d warming since 1901; observed\ntrends there were inconsistent with CMIP5 All Forcing historical\nruns.28\nThe\ncause of this \u201cwarming hole,\u201d or lack of a long-term warming trend,\nremains uncertain, though it is likely a combination of natural and\nhuman causes. Some studies conclude that changes in anthropogenic\naerosols have played a crucial role (e.g., Leibensperger et al.\n2012a,b;29\n,30\nYu et al. 201431\n), whereas other studies infer a possible large role for atmospheric\ncirculation,32\ninternal climate variability (e.g., Meehl et al. 2012;8\nKnutson et al.\n2013a28\n), and\nchanges in land use (e.g., Goldstein et al. 2009;33\nXu et al. 201534\n). Notably, the\nSoutheast has been warming rapidly since the early 1960s.35\n,36\nIn summary, there\nis medium confidence for detectable anthropogenic warming over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States.\nFigure 6.6\nDetection and attribution assessment of trends in annual average\ntemperature (\u00b0F). Grid-box values indicate whether linear trends\nfor 1901\u20132015 are detectable (that is, distinct from natural\nvariability) and/or consistent with CMIP5 historical All-Forcing\nruns. If the grid-box trend is found to be both detectable and\neither consistent with or greater than the warming in the All-Forcing\nruns, then the grid box is assessed as having a detectable anthropogenic\ncontribution to warming over the period. Gray regions represent\ngrid boxes with data that are too sparse for detection and attribution.\n(Figure source: updated from Knutson et al. 2013;28\n\u00a9 American Meteorological\nSociety. Used with permission.)\n6.2.2\nTemperature Extremes\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC\u2019s) Fifth\nAssessment Report (AR5)24\nconcluded that it is very likely that human influence has\ncontributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of\ntemperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\nThe combined influence of anthropogenic and natural forcings was\nalso detectable (medium confidence) over large subregions of North\nAmerica (e.g., Zwiers et al. 2011;37\nMin et al. 201338\n). In general,\nhowever, results for the contiguous United States are not as\ncompelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of\nchanges in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme\ntemperature in the 1930s.17\nTable 6.3 summarizes\navailable attribution statements for recent extreme U.S. temperature\nevents. As an example, the recent record or near-record high March\u2013May\naverage temperatures occurring in 2012 over the eastern United\nStates were attributed in part to external (natural plus anthropogenic)\nforcing;39\nthe century-scale trend response of temperature to external forcing\nis typically a close approximation to the anthropogenic forcing\nresponse alone. Another study found that although the extreme March\n2012 warm anomalies over the United States were mostly due to natural\nvariability, anthropogenic warming contributed to the severity.40\nSuch statements\nreveal that both natural and anthropogenic factors influence the\nseverity of extreme temperature events. Nearly every modern analysis\nof current extreme hot and cold events reveals some degree of\nattributable human influence.\n6.3: Projected Changes\n6.3.1 Average Temperatures\nTemperature projections are based on global model results and\nassociated downscaled products from CMIP5 using a suite of\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In contrast to NCA3,\nmodel weighting is employed to refine projections of temperature\nfor each RCP (Ch. 4: Projections; Appendix B: Model Weighting).\nWeighting parameters are based on model independence and skill over\nNorth America for seasonal temperature and annual extremes. Unless\nstated otherwise, all changes presented here represent the weighted\nmultimodel mean. The weighting scheme helps refine confidence and\nlikelihood statements, but projections of U.S. surface air temperature\nremain very similar to those in NCA3. Generally speaking, extreme\ntemperatures are projected to increase even more than average\ntemperatures.41\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States is\nprojected to rise throughout the century. Increases for the period\n2021\u20132050 relative to 1976\u20132005 are projected to be about 2.5\u00b0F\n(1.4\u00b0C) for a lower scenario (RCP4.5) and 2.9\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0C) for the\nhigher scenario (RCP8.5); the similarity in warming reflects the\nsimilarity in greenhouse gas concentrations during this period\n(Figure 4.1). Notably, a 2.5\u00b0F (1.4\u00b0C) increase makes the near-term\naverage comparable to the hottest year in the historical record\n(2012). In other words, recent record-breaking years may be \u201ccommon\u201d\nin the next few decades. By late-century (2071\u20132100), the RCPs\ndiverge significantly, leading to different rates of warming:\napproximately 5.0\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 8.7\u00b0F (4.8\u00b0C) for RCP8.5.\nLikewise, there are different ranges of warming for each scenario:\n2.8\u00b0\u20137.3\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0\u20134.1\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 5.8\u00b0\u201311.9\u00b0F (3.2\u00b0\u20136.6\u00b0C) for\nRCP8.5. (The range is defined here as the difference between the\naverage increase in the three coolest models and the average increase\nin the three warmest models.) For both RCPs, slightly greater\nincreases are projected in summer than winter (except for Alaska),\nand average maximums will rise slightly faster than average minimums\n(except in the Southeast and Southern Great Plains).\nFigure 6.7\nProjected changes in annual average temperatures (\u00b0F). Changes are\nthe difference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065; top)\nor late-century (2070-2099, bottom) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005). Each map depicts the weighted multimodel mean. Increases\nare statistically significant in all areas (that is, more than 50%\nof the models show a statistically significant change, and more\nthan 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nStatistically significant warming is projected for all parts of the\nUnited States throughout the century (Figure 6.7). Consistent with\npolar amplification, warming rates (and spatial gradients) are\ngreater at higher latitudes. For example, warming is largest in\nAlaska (more than 12.0\u00b0F [6.7\u00b0C] in the northern half of the state\nby late-century under RCP8.5), driven in part by a decrease in snow\ncover and thus surface albedo. Similarly, northern regions of the\ncontiguous United States have slightly more warming than other\nregions (roughly 9.0\u00b0F [5.5\u00b0C] in the Northeast, Midwest, and\nNorthern Great Plains by late-century under RCP8.5; Table 6.4). The\nSoutheast has slightly less warming because of latent heat release\nfrom increases in evapotranspiration (as is already evident in the\nobserved record). Warming is smallest in Hawai\u2018i and the Caribbean\n(roughly 4.0\u00b0\u20136.0\u00b0F [2.2\u00b0\u20133.3\u00b0C] by late century under RCP8.5)\ndue to the moderating effects of surrounding oceans. From a\nsub-regional perspective, less warming is projected along the coasts\nof the contiguous United States, again due to maritime influences,\nalthough increases are still substantial. Warming at higher elevations\nmay be underestimated because the resolution of the CMIP5 models\ndoes not capture orography in detail.\nRCP4.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP8.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP4.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\nRCP8.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\n6.3.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.8\nProjected changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures\n(\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States. Changes are the\ndifference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the\naverage for near-present (1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario\n(RCP8.5). Maps in the top row depict the weighted multimodel mean\nwhereas maps on the bottom row depict the mean of the three warmest\nmodels (that is, the models with the largest temperature increase).\nMaps are derived from 32 climate model projections that were\nstatistically downscaled using the Localized Constructed Analogs\ntechnique.51\nIncreases are\nstatistically significant in all areas (that is\u00ad\u00ad,\nmore than 50% of the models show a statistically significant change,\nand more than 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nDaily extreme temperatures are projected to increase substantially\nin the contiguous United States, particularly under the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5). For instance, the coldest and warmest daily\ntemperatures of the year are expected to increase at least 5\u00b0F\n(2.8\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century,42\nrising to 10\u00b0F (5.5\u00b0C)\nor more by late-century.43\nIn general, there will\nbe larger increases in the coldest temperatures of the year,\nespecially in the northern half of the Nation, whereas the warmest\ntemperatures will exhibit somewhat more uniform changes geographically\n(Figure 6.8). By mid-century, the upper bound for projected changes\n(i.e., the average of the three warmest models) is about 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C)\ngreater than the weighted multimodel mean. On a regional basis,\nannual extremes (Table 6.5) are consistently projected to rise\nfaster than annual averages (Table 6.4). Future changes in \u201cvery\nrare\u201d extremes are also striking; by late century, current 1-in-20\nyear maximums are projected to occur every year, while current\n1-in-20 year minimums are not expected to occur at all.44\nThe frequency and intensity of cold waves is projected to decrease\nwhile the frequency and intensity of heat waves is projected to\nincrease throughout the century. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile) will\ndecrease the most in Alaska and the least in the Northeast while\nthe frequency of heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile) will increase in all regions, particularly\nthe Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska. By mid-century, decreases in\nthe frequency of cold waves are similar across RCPs whereas increases\nin the frequency of heat waves are about 50% greater in the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5) than the lower scenario (RCP4.5).45\nThe intensity of cold\nwaves is projected to decrease while the intensity of heat waves\nis projected to increase, dramatically so under RCP8.5. By mid-century,\nboth extreme cold waves and extreme heat waves (5-day, 1-in-10 year\nevents) are projected to have temperature increases of at least\n11.0\u00b0F (6.1\u00b0C) nationwide, with larger increases in northern regions\n(the Northeast, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, and Northwest; Table\n6.5).\nFigure 6.9\nProjected changes in the number of days per year with a maximum\ntemperature above 90\u00b0F and a minimum temperature below 32\u00b0F in the\ncontiguous United States. Changes are the difference between the\naverage for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario (RCP8.5). Maps in the top row\ndepict the weighted multimodel mean whereas maps on the bottom row\ndepict the mean of the three warmest models (that is, the models\nwith the largest temperature increase). Maps are derived from 32\nclimate model projections that were statistically downscaled using\nthe Localized Constructed Analogs technique.51\nChanges are statistically\nsignificant in all areas (that is, more than 50% of the models show\na statistically significant change, and more than 67% agree on the\nsign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC and NOAA NCEI).\nThere are large projected changes in the number of days exceeding\nkey temperature thresholds throughout the contiguous United States.\nFor instance, there are about 20\u201330 more days per year with a maximum\nover 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century under RCP8.5, with\nincreases of 40\u201350 days in much of the Southeast (Figure 6.9). The\nupper bound for projected changes is very roughly 10 days greater\nthan the weighted multimodel mean. Consistent with widespread\nwarming, there are 20\u201330 fewer days per year with a minimum temperature\nbelow freezing in the northern and eastern parts of the nation,\nwith decreases of more than 40\u201350 days in much the West. The upper\nbound for projected changes in freezing events is very roughly 10\u201320\ndays fewer than the weighted multimodel mean in many areas.\nReferences\nModal\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n1800 G Street, NW, Suite 9100, Washington, DC 20006 USA\nTel: +1 202.223.6262 | Fax: +1 202.223.3065\nContact Us \u2022\nCredits \u2022\nPrivacy Policy \u2022\nSite Map\nSome figures and images are copyright protected.\nPermission of the copyright owner must be obtained\nbefore making use of copyrighted material."

Police find a homeless woman dead on the sidewalk,\u201d the news anchor said.  \nAt this, Howard dropped what he was doing and hurried closer to the TV. \n\u201cThe cause is believed to be from the extreme heat.\u201d \nHoward knew that was likely because a high-pressure system known as a heat dome had recently moved over South Texas. The meteorological phenomenon acts like a closed oven door, trapping a roiling mass of hot air below. The official temperature that day had reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41\u00b0C) \u2013 12 degrees higher than average for that date. The dead woman was later identified as 46-year-old Jessica Witzel.\nAlthough Howard didn\u2019t know her, Witzel\u2019s death hit him hard.\n\u201cIt was right here in San Antonio,\u201d he said. \u201cA specific person gives the numbers a name and a face.\u201d\nHoward is a numbers guy by profession. An associate professor of public health at the University of Texas at San Antonio \u2013 a 15-minute drive from where Witzel died \u2013 Howard specializes in using large data sets to understand acute and long-term health consequences from exposure to traumas of all sorts. \nHeat-related deaths were already uppermost on his mind that evening. He was the lead author of a study about to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cTrends of Heat-Related Deaths in the US, 1999\u20132023\u201d was the first scientific paper to document an abrupt, steep rise in heat-related deaths across the country, one that is likely linked to climate change.\nThe study found that between 1999 and 2023, the heat-related mortality rate \u2013 the number of deaths per 100,000 people \u2013 rose by 63%. But the data showed something even more disturbing: The trend is rapidly accelerating. \n\u201cThe death rate,\u201d Howard said, \u201chas risen 117% in the last seven years.\u201d\nSara Meerow is an urban heat expert at Arizona State University in Tempe, a city just to the east of Phoenix in Maricopa County. Last year, 645 heat-related deaths were recorded in the county. Heat deaths have long been considered a problem largely confined to the Phoenix metro area, Meerow said.  \nBut Howard\u2019s research \u201csuggests that increases in the number of heat-related deaths over the past few years in Phoenix, Arizona, are part of a national trend,\u201d she said.\nThe climate is changing, and our journalists are here to help you make sense of it. Sign up for our weekly email newsletter and never miss a story.\nMeerow, an associate professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at ASU, was herself the lead author of a journal article published only days before Howard\u2019s. Hers looked at what officials are doing \u2013 and failing to do \u2013 to reduce heat-related deaths in the U.S.\nAlthough heat kills more U.S. residents than any other form of extreme weather, Meerow pointed out that \u201ccompared with other hazards like flooding, heat is less visible and largely unregulated.\u201d\nFor example, Meerow noted in the paper, the federal government maps flood zones, builds levees, subsidizes flood insurance, and provides financial and other aid to people who have suffered a flooding disaster. But there are no similar measures to help U.S. residents likely to experience deadly heat waves.\nJessica Witzel\u2019s death is a tragically typical example of how officials at all levels of government are failing to protect Americans from extreme heat.\nWitzel was unhoused and had been diagnosed with severe mental disorders. Living on the street, without access to a cool shelter, people are far more likely to suffer heat-related illnesses, from temporary heat cramps to potentially lethal heat stroke. Mental disorders can interfere with a person\u2019s ability to recognize when their body temperature is rising to dangerous levels. In rural and urban America, there is a chronic shortage of shelter beds for unhoused people, air-conditioned spaces that are open to the public when needed, and mental health care for vulnerable populations that can\u2019t afford health insurance.\nRead: For unhoused people in America\u2019s hottest large city, heat waves are a merciless killer\nWitzel died at what could be considered ground zero in San Antonio\u2019s urban heat island, where the combination of vast stretches of concrete and lack of vegetation and shade sends already high temperatures skyrocketing. Waste heat from gas-powered vehicles is a significant contributor to urban heat islands, and Interstate 10 is less than 1,000 feet south of where Witzel was found. To the north, and even closer, is an enormous concrete parking lot servicing the city\u2019s 500-bus transit system.\nExactly how hot it was at the time and place Witzel was found isn\u2019t known, but Greg Harman has a pretty good idea. Harman is the founder of Deceleration, a nonprofit online journal in San Antonio that describes its beat as \u201cthe intersection of environment and justice.\u201d During the scorching San Antonio summers, Harman travels to different neighborhoods to document and write about the disparate impact of heat on residents based on location.\nThe day before Witzel died, Harman had used an extremely accurate tool to measure the temperature and humidity in downtown San Antonio. The official high that day was 108 degrees (42\u00b0C), but that reading was taken at the airport, several miles from the city\u2019s hotter urban core.\n\u201cDowntown, the air temperature was 119 degrees [48\u00b0C],\u201d Harman said. \u201cThe heat index, which combines heat and humidity to determine how hot it feels to the human body, was 129 degrees [54\u00b0C].\u201d\nWitzel\u2019s death also underscores what experts agree is a fundamental problem in working to reduce heat mortalities.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades that the official numbers of heat-related deaths are massive underestimates,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, professor of global health at the University of Washington. Without knowing the true size and other details of the problem, she added, it\u2019s hard to set priorities for action.\nEbi pointed to several factors that lead to these undercounts, beginning with the fact that there is no nationwide standard for reporting heat deaths. Bexar County, Texas, for example, which includes San Antonio, doesn\u2019t track deaths caused by heat, which means that Witzel is unlikely to be included in state or national counts of heat mortalities, regardless of what cause of death is listed on her death certificate.\nWhich points to another problem: Death certificates are not necessarily reliable indicators of heat deaths.\n\u201cExtreme heat can cause a heart attack,\u201d Ebi explained. \u201cIf somebody comes into an emergency room having a heart attack, the people working there may not know whether the person had been exposed to extreme heat.\u201d \nIf the patient dies, the cause of death is recorded simply as a heart attack.\nAnother reason a death certificate may not mention heat is that there\u2019s no state or federal standard for who can issue death certificates.\nRead: Climate change played a role in killing tens of thousands of people in 2023 \nIn Texas, large metropolitan areas are likely to have professional medical examiners. \u201cBut in smaller cities and in rural areas,\u201d Howard said, \u201cthe person filling out the death certificate might be a justice of the peace who has no medical training at all.\u201d\nThat may partly explain why metro Phoenix reports such a disproportionately large share of heat deaths (in addition to its being a sprawling, car-centric desert city).\n\u201cThe medical examiner\u2019s office in Phoenix has a rigorous protocol in place for determining heat-related deaths,\u201d Howard said. \nSimply put, if you\u2019re actively looking for heat-related deaths, you\u2019ll likely get a more accurate count than if you\u2019re not looking. Given the precipitous rise in heat deaths across the country documented in Howard\u2019s study, he believes getting a more accurate count is vital to taking action to save lives.\n\u201cGoing forward,\u201d Howard said, \u201cthere should be a much more concerted effort nationally around developing protocols and processes that are more standardized for assessing heat-related deaths.\u201d\nAt a vigil for Jessica Witzel held days after her death, one of her childhood friends put it succinctly. Standing under an umbrella against the intense Texas sunlight, Marisol Cortez, who also co-edits Deceleration, spoke to the small group of family and friends gathered near the spot where Witzel had died.\nShe directed these words to government officials.\n\u201cCount the bodies!\u201d Witzel\u2019s friend demanded.\nWe help millions of people understand climate change and what to do about it.

      "Chapter 6: Temperature Changes in the United States\nKey Findings\nKey Finding 1\nAnnual average temperature over the contiguous United States\nhas increased by 1.2\u00b0F (0.7\u00b0C) for the period 1986\u20132016 relative\nto 1901\u20131960 and by 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) based on a linear regression for\nthe period 1895\u20132016 (very high confidence). Surface and satellite\ndata are consistent in their depiction of rapid warming since 1979\n(high confidence). Paleo-temperature evidence shows that recent\ndecades are the warmest of the past 1,500 years (medium confidence).\nKey Finding 2\nThere have been marked changes in temperature extremes across\nthe contiguous United States. The frequency of cold waves has\ndecreased since the early 1900s, and the frequency of heat waves\nhas increased since the mid-1960s. The Dust Bowl era of the 1930s\nremains the peak period for extreme heat. The number of high\ntemperature records set in the past two decades far exceeds the\nnumber of low temperature records.

See Guide to this Report for more on\nassessments of likelihood and confidence.\n6.0: Introduction\nTemperature is among the most important climatic elements used in\ndecision-making. For example, builders and insurers use temperature\ndata for planning and risk management while energy companies and\nregulators use temperature data to predict demand and set utility\nrates. Temperature is also a key indicator of climate change: recent\nincreases are apparent over the land, ocean, and troposphere, and\nsubstantial changes are expected for this century. This chapter\nsummarizes the major observed and projected changes in near-surface\nair temperature over the United States, emphasizing new data sets\nand model projections since the Third National Climate Assessment\n(NCA3). Changes are depicted using a spectrum of observations,\nincluding surface weather stations, moored ocean buoys, polar-orbiting\nsatellites, and temperature-sensitive proxies. Projections are based\non global models and downscaled products from CMIP5 (Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5) using a suite of Representative\nConcentration Pathways (RCPs; see Ch. 4: Projections for more on\nRCPs and future scenarios).\n6.1: Historical Changes\n6.1.1 Average Temperatures\nChanges in average temperature are described using a suite of\nobservational datasets. As in NCA3, changes in land temperature are\nassessed using the nClimGrid dataset.1\n,2\nAlong U.S. coastlines,\nchanges in sea surface temperatures are quantified using a new\nreconstruction3\nthat forms the ocean component of the NOAA Global Temperature\ndataset.4\nChanges in middle tropospheric temperature are examined using updated\nversions of multiple satellite datasets.5\n,6\n,7\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States has\nrisen since the start of the 20th century. In general, temperature\nincreased until about 1940, decreased until about 1970, and increased\nrapidly through 2016. Because the increase was not constant over\ntime, multiple methods were evaluated in this report (as in NCA3)\nto quantify the trend. All methods yielded rates of warming that\nwere significant at the 95% level. The lowest estimate of 1.2\u00b0F\n(0.7\u00b0C) was obtained by computing the difference between the average\nfor 1986\u20132016 (i.e., present-day) and the average for 1901\u20131960\n(i.e., the first half of the last century). The highest estimate\nof 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) was obtained by fitting a linear (least-squares)\nregression line through the period 1895\u20132016. Thus, the temperature\nincrease cited in this assessment is 1.2\u00b0\u20131.8\u00b0F (0.7\u00b0\u20131.0\u00b0C).\nThis increase is about 0.1\u00b0F (0.06\u00b0C) less than presented in NCA3,\nand it results from the use of slightly different periods in each\nreport. In particular, the decline in the lower bound stems from\nthe use of different time periods to represent present-day climate\n(NCA3 used 1991\u20132012, which was slightly warmer than the 1986\u20132016\nperiod used here). The decline in the upper bound stems mainly from\ntemperature differences late in the record (e.g., the last year of\ndata available for NCA3 was 2012, which was the warmest year on\nrecord for the contiguous United States).\nEach NCA region experienced a net warming through 2016 (Table 6.1).\nThe largest changes were in the western United States, where average\ntemperature increased by more than 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in Alaska, the\nNorthwest, the Southwest, and also in the Northern Great Plains.\nAs noted in NCA3, the Southeast had the least warming, driven by a\ncombination of natural variations and human influences.8\nIn most regions, average\nminimum temperature increased at a slightly higher rate than average\nmaximum temperature, with the Midwest having the largest discrepancy,\nand the Southwest and Northwest having the smallest. This differential\nrate of warming resulted in a continuing decrease in the diurnal\ntemperature range that is consistent with other parts of the globe.9\nAnnual average\nsea surface temperature also increased along all regional coastlines\n(see Figure 1.3), though changes were generally smaller than over\nland owing to the higher heat capacity of water. Increases were\nlargest in Alaska (greater than 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]) while increases\nwere smallest (less than 0.5\u00b0F [0.3\u00b0C]) in coastal areas of the\nSoutheast.\nMore than 95% of the land surface of the contiguous United States\nhad an increase in annual average temperature (Figure 6.1). In\ncontrast, only small (and somewhat dispersed) parts of the Southeast\nand Southern Great Plains experienced cooling. From a seasonal\nperspective, warming was greatest and most widespread in winter,\nwith increases of over 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in most areas. In summer,\nwarming was less extensive (mainly along the East Coast and in the\nwestern third of the Nation), while cooling was evident in parts\nof the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains.\nFigure 6.1\nObserved changes in annual, winter, and summer temperature (\u00b0F). Changes are the difference\nbetween the average for present-day (1986\u20132016) and the average for the first half of\nthe last century (1901\u20131960 for the contiguous United States, 1925\u20131960 for Alaska and Hawai\u2018i).\nEstimates are derived from the nClimDiv dataset.\n1\n,2\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nThere has been a rapid increase in the average temperature of the\ncontiguous United States over the past several decades. There is\ngeneral consistency on this point between the surface thermometer\nrecord from NOAA1\nand the middle tropospheric satellite records from Remote Sensing\nSystems (RSS),5\nNOAA\u2019s Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR),7\nand the University\nof Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).6\nIn particular, for the\nperiod 1979\u20132016, the rate of warming in the surface record was\n0.512\u00b0F (0.284\u00b0C) per decade, versus trends of 0.455\u00b0F (0.253\u00b0C),\n0.421\u00b0F (0.234\u00b0C), and 0.289\u00b0F (0.160 \u00b0C) per decade for RSS version\n4, STAR version 3, and UAH version 6, respectively (after accounting\nfor stratospheric influences). All trends are statistically significant\nat the 95% level. For the contiguous United States, the year 2016\nwas the second-warmest on record at the surface and in the middle\ntroposphere (2012 was the warmest year at the surface, and 2015 was\nthe warmest in the middle troposphere). Generally speaking, surface\nand satellite records do not have identical trends because they do\nnot represent the same physical quantity; surface measurements are\nmade using thermometers in shelters about 1.5 meters above the\nground whereas satellite measurements are mass-weighted averages\nof microwave emissions from deep atmospheric layers. The UAH record\nlikely has a lower trend because it differs from the other satellite\nproducts in the treatment of target temperatures from the NOAA-9\nsatellite as well as in the correction for diurnal drift.10\nRecent paleo-temperature evidence confirms the unusual character\nof wide-scale warming during the past few decades as determined\nfrom the instrumental record. The most important new paleoclimate\nstudy since NCA3 showed that for each of the seven continental\nregions, the reconstructed area-weighted average temperature for\n1971\u20132000 was higher than for any other time in nearly 1,400 years,11\nalthough with\nsignificant uncertainty around the central estimate that leads to\nthis conclusion. Recent (up to 2006) 30-year smoothed temperatures\nacross temperate North America (including most of the continental\nUnited States) are similarly reconstructed as the warmest over the\npast 1,500 years12\n(Figure 6.2). Unlike the PAGES 2k seven-continent result mentioned\nabove, this conclusion for North America is robust in relation to\nthe estimated uncertainty range. Reconstruction data since 1500 for\nwestern temperate North America show the same conclusion at the\nannual time scale for 1986\u20132005. This time period and the running\n20-year periods thereafter are warmer than all possible continuous\n20-year sequences in a 1,000-member statistical reconstruction\nensemble.13\n6.1.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.2\nPollen-based temperature reconstruction for temperate North America.\nThe blue curve depicts the pollen-based reconstruction of 30-year\naverages (as anomalies from 1904 to 1980) for the temperate region\n(30\u00b0\u201355\u00b0N, 75\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0W). The red curve shows the corresponding tree\nring-based decadal average reconstruction, which was smoothed and\nused to calibrate the lower-frequency pollen-based estimate. Light\n(medium) blue zones indicate 2 standard error (1 standard error)\nuncertainty estimations associated with each 30-year value. The\nblack curve shows comparably smoothed instrumental temperature\nvalues up to 1980. The dashed black line represents the average\ntemperature anomaly of comparably smoothed instrumental data for\nthe period 2000\u20132006. (Figure source: NOAA NCEI).\nShifts in temperature extremes are examined using a suite of\nsocietally relevant climate change indices14\n,15\nderived from long-term\nobservations of daily surface temperature.16\nThe coldest and warmest\ntemperatures of the year are of particular relevance given their\nwidespread use in engineering, agricultural, and other sectoral\napplications (for example, extreme annual design conditions by the\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning;\nplant hardiness zones by the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Cold\nwaves and heat waves (that is, extended periods of below or above\nnormal temperature) are likewise of great importance because of\ntheir numerous societal and environmental impacts, which span from\nhuman health to plant and animal phenology. Changes are considered\nfor a spectrum of event frequencies and intensities, ranging from\nthe typical annual extreme to the 1-in-10 year event (an extreme\nthat only has a 10% chance of occurrence in any given year). The\ndiscussion focuses on the contiguous United States; Alaska, Hawai\u2018i,\nand the Caribbean do not have a sufficient number of long-term\nstations for a century-scale analysis.\nCold extremes have become less severe over the past century. For\nexample, the coldest daily temperature of the year has increased\nat most locations in the contiguous United States (Figure 6.3). All\nregions experienced net increases (Table 6.2), with the largest\nrises in the Northern Great Plains and the Northwest (roughly 4.5\u00b0F\n[2.5\u00b0C]), and the smallest in the Southeast (about 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]).\nIn general, there were increases throughout the record, with a\nslight acceleration in recent decades (Figure 6.3). The temperature\nof extremely cold days (1-in-10 year events) generally exhibited\nthe same pattern of increases as the coldest daily temperature of\nthe year. Consistent with these increases, the number of cool nights\nper year (those with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile\nfor 1961\u20131990) declined in all regions, with much of the West having\ndecreases of roughly two weeks. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile for\n1961\u20131990) has fallen over the past century (Figure 6.4). The\nfrequency of intense cold waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) peaked\nin the 1980s and then reached record-low levels in the 2000s.17\nFigure 6.3\nObserved changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures (\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States.\nMaps (top) depict changes at stations; changes are the difference between the average for present-day (1986\u20132016)\nand the average for the first half of the last century (1901\u20131960). Time series (bottom) depict the area-weighted\naverage for the contiguous United States. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with minimal missing data\nin the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily dataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nFigure 6.4\nObserved changes in cold and heat waves in the contiguous United States. The top panel depicts changes\nin the frequency of cold waves; the middle panel depicts changes in the frequency of heat waves; and the\nbottom panel depicts changes in the intensity of heat waves. Cold and heat wave frequency indices are\ndefined in Zhang et al.,15\nand the heat wave\nintensity index is defined in Russo et al.14\nEstimates are\nderived from long-term stations with minimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in warm extremes are more nuanced than changes in cold\nextremes. For instance, the warmest daily temperature of the year\nincreased in some parts of the West over the past century (Figure\n6.3), but there were decreases in almost all locations east of the\nRocky Mountains. In fact, all eastern regions experienced a net\ndecrease (Table 6.2), most notably the Midwest (about 2.2\u00b0F [1.2\u00b0C])\nand the Southeast (roughly 1.5\u00b0F [0.8\u00b0C]). The decreases in the\neastern half of Nation, particularly in the Great Plains, are mainly\ntied to the unprecedented summer heat of the 1930s Dust Bowl era,\nwhich was exacerbated by land-surface feedbacks driven by springtime\nprecipitation deficits and land mismanagement.18\nHowever, anthropogenic\naerosol forcing may also have reduced summer temperatures in the\nNortheast and Southeast from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s,19\nand agricultural\nintensification may have suppressed the hottest extremes in the\nMidwest.20\nSince the mid-1960s, there has been only a very slight increase in\nthe warmest daily temperature of the year (amidst large interannual\nvariability). Heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile for 1961\u20131990) increased in frequency\nuntil the mid-1930s, became considerably less common through the\nmid-1960s, and increased in frequency again thereafter (Figure 6.4).\nAs with warm daily temperatures, heat wave magnitude reached a\nmaximum in the 1930s. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day,\n1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most\nregions except the Midwest and the Great Plains.17\n,21\nSince the early 1980s\n(Figure 6.4), there is suggestive evidence of a slight increase in\nthe intensity of heat waves nationwide14\nas well as an increase\nin the concurrence of droughts and heat waves.22\nFigure 6.5\nObserved changes in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures\nin the contiguous United States. Red bars indicate a year with more\ndaily record highs than daily record lows, while blue bars indicate\na year with more record lows than highs. The height of the bar\nindicates the ratio of record highs to lows (red) or of record lows\nto highs (blue). For example, a ratio of 2:1 for a blue bar means\nthat there were twice as many record daily lows as daily record\nhighs that year. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with\nminimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures are\nalso apparent. Very generally, the number of record lows has been\ndeclining since the late-1970s while the number of record highs has\nbeen rising.23\nBy extension, there has been an increase in the ratio of the\nnumber of record highs to record lows (Figure 6.5). Over the past\ntwo decades, the average of this ratio exceeds two (meaning that\ntwice as many high-temperature records have been set as low-temperature\nrecords). The number of new highs has surpassed the number of new\nlows in 15 of the last 20 years, with 2012 and 2016 being particularly\nextreme (ratios of seven and five, respectively).\n6.2: Detection and Attribution\n6.2.1\nAverage Temperatures\nWhile a confident attribution of global temperature increases to\nanthropogenic forcing has been made,24\ndetection and attribution\nassessment statements for smaller regions are generally much weaker.\nNevertheless, some detectable anthropogenic influences on average\ntemperature have been reported for North America and parts of the\nUnited States (e.g., Christidis et al. 2010;25\nBonfils et al. 2008;26\nPierce et al.\n200927\n).\nFigure 6.6 shows an example for linear trends for 1901\u20132015,\nindicating a detectable anthropogenic warming since 1901 over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States for\nthe CMIP5 multimodel ensemble\u2014a condition that was also met for\nmost of the individual models.28\nThe Southeast stands out\nas the only region with no \u201cdetectable\u201d warming since 1901; observed\ntrends there were inconsistent with CMIP5 All Forcing historical\nruns.28\nThe\ncause of this \u201cwarming hole,\u201d or lack of a long-term warming trend,\nremains uncertain, though it is likely a combination of natural and\nhuman causes. Some studies conclude that changes in anthropogenic\naerosols have played a crucial role (e.g., Leibensperger et al.\n2012a,b;29\n,30\nYu et al. 201431\n), whereas other studies infer a possible large role for atmospheric\ncirculation,32\ninternal climate variability (e.g., Meehl et al. 2012;8\nKnutson et al.\n2013a28\n), and\nchanges in land use (e.g., Goldstein et al. 2009;33\nXu et al. 201534\n). Notably, the\nSoutheast has been warming rapidly since the early 1960s.35\n,36\nIn summary, there\nis medium confidence for detectable anthropogenic warming over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States.\nFigure 6.6\nDetection and attribution assessment of trends in annual average\ntemperature (\u00b0F). Grid-box values indicate whether linear trends\nfor 1901\u20132015 are detectable (that is, distinct from natural\nvariability) and/or consistent with CMIP5 historical All-Forcing\nruns. If the grid-box trend is found to be both detectable and\neither consistent with or greater than the warming in the All-Forcing\nruns, then the grid box is assessed as having a detectable anthropogenic\ncontribution to warming over the period. Gray regions represent\ngrid boxes with data that are too sparse for detection and attribution.\n(Figure source: updated from Knutson et al. 2013;28\n\u00a9 American Meteorological\nSociety. Used with permission.)\n6.2.2\nTemperature Extremes\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC\u2019s) Fifth\nAssessment Report (AR5)24\nconcluded that it is very likely that human influence has\ncontributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of\ntemperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\nThe combined influence of anthropogenic and natural forcings was\nalso detectable (medium confidence) over large subregions of North\nAmerica (e.g., Zwiers et al. 2011;37\nMin et al. 201338\n). In general,\nhowever, results for the contiguous United States are not as\ncompelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of\nchanges in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme\ntemperature in the 1930s.17\nTable 6.3 summarizes\navailable attribution statements for recent extreme U.S. temperature\nevents. As an example, the recent record or near-record high March\u2013May\naverage temperatures occurring in 2012 over the eastern United\nStates were attributed in part to external (natural plus anthropogenic)\nforcing;39\nthe century-scale trend response of temperature to external forcing\nis typically a close approximation to the anthropogenic forcing\nresponse alone. Another study found that although the extreme March\n2012 warm anomalies over the United States were mostly due to natural\nvariability, anthropogenic warming contributed to the severity.40\nSuch statements\nreveal that both natural and anthropogenic factors influence the\nseverity of extreme temperature events. Nearly every modern analysis\nof current extreme hot and cold events reveals some degree of\nattributable human influence.\n6.3: Projected Changes\n6.3.1 Average Temperatures\nTemperature projections are based on global model results and\nassociated downscaled products from CMIP5 using a suite of\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In contrast to NCA3,\nmodel weighting is employed to refine projections of temperature\nfor each RCP (Ch. 4: Projections; Appendix B: Model Weighting).\nWeighting parameters are based on model independence and skill over\nNorth America for seasonal temperature and annual extremes. Unless\nstated otherwise, all changes presented here represent the weighted\nmultimodel mean. The weighting scheme helps refine confidence and\nlikelihood statements, but projections of U.S. surface air temperature\nremain very similar to those in NCA3. Generally speaking, extreme\ntemperatures are projected to increase even more than average\ntemperatures.41\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States is\nprojected to rise throughout the century. Increases for the period\n2021\u20132050 relative to 1976\u20132005 are projected to be about 2.5\u00b0F\n(1.4\u00b0C) for a lower scenario (RCP4.5) and 2.9\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0C) for the\nhigher scenario (RCP8.5); the similarity in warming reflects the\nsimilarity in greenhouse gas concentrations during this period\n(Figure 4.1). Notably, a 2.5\u00b0F (1.4\u00b0C) increase makes the near-term\naverage comparable to the hottest year in the historical record\n(2012). In other words, recent record-breaking years may be \u201ccommon\u201d\nin the next few decades. By late-century (2071\u20132100), the RCPs\ndiverge significantly, leading to different rates of warming:\napproximately 5.0\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 8.7\u00b0F (4.8\u00b0C) for RCP8.5.\nLikewise, there are different ranges of warming for each scenario:\n2.8\u00b0\u20137.3\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0\u20134.1\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 5.8\u00b0\u201311.9\u00b0F (3.2\u00b0\u20136.6\u00b0C) for\nRCP8.5. (The range is defined here as the difference between the\naverage increase in the three coolest models and the average increase\nin the three warmest models.) For both RCPs, slightly greater\nincreases are projected in summer than winter (except for Alaska),\nand average maximums will rise slightly faster than average minimums\n(except in the Southeast and Southern Great Plains).\nFigure 6.7\nProjected changes in annual average temperatures (\u00b0F). Changes are\nthe difference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065; top)\nor late-century (2070-2099, bottom) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005). Each map depicts the weighted multimodel mean. Increases\nare statistically significant in all areas (that is, more than 50%\nof the models show a statistically significant change, and more\nthan 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nStatistically significant warming is projected for all parts of the\nUnited States throughout the century (Figure 6.7). Consistent with\npolar amplification, warming rates (and spatial gradients) are\ngreater at higher latitudes. For example, warming is largest in\nAlaska (more than 12.0\u00b0F [6.7\u00b0C] in the northern half of the state\nby late-century under RCP8.5), driven in part by a decrease in snow\ncover and thus surface albedo. Similarly, northern regions of the\ncontiguous United States have slightly more warming than other\nregions (roughly 9.0\u00b0F [5.5\u00b0C] in the Northeast, Midwest, and\nNorthern Great Plains by late-century under RCP8.5; Table 6.4). The\nSoutheast has slightly less warming because of latent heat release\nfrom increases in evapotranspiration (as is already evident in the\nobserved record). Warming is smallest in Hawai\u2018i and the Caribbean\n(roughly 4.0\u00b0\u20136.0\u00b0F [2.2\u00b0\u20133.3\u00b0C] by late century under RCP8.5)\ndue to the moderating effects of surrounding oceans. From a\nsub-regional perspective, less warming is projected along the coasts\nof the contiguous United States, again due to maritime influences,\nalthough increases are still substantial. Warming at higher elevations\nmay be underestimated because the resolution of the CMIP5 models\ndoes not capture orography in detail.\nRCP4.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP8.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP4.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\nRCP8.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\n6.3.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.8\nProjected changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures\n(\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States. Changes are the\ndifference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the\naverage for near-present (1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario\n(RCP8.5). Maps in the top row depict the weighted multimodel mean\nwhereas maps on the bottom row depict the mean of the three warmest\nmodels (that is, the models with the largest temperature increase).\nMaps are derived from 32 climate model projections that were\nstatistically downscaled using the Localized Constructed Analogs\ntechnique.51\nIncreases are\nstatistically significant in all areas (that is\u00ad\u00ad,\nmore than 50% of the models show a statistically significant change,\nand more than 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nDaily extreme temperatures are projected to increase substantially\nin the contiguous United States, particularly under the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5). For instance, the coldest and warmest daily\ntemperatures of the year are expected to increase at least 5\u00b0F\n(2.8\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century,42\nrising to 10\u00b0F (5.5\u00b0C)\nor more by late-century.43\nIn general, there will\nbe larger increases in the coldest temperatures of the year,\nespecially in the northern half of the Nation, whereas the warmest\ntemperatures will exhibit somewhat more uniform changes geographically\n(Figure 6.8). By mid-century, the upper bound for projected changes\n(i.e., the average of the three warmest models) is about 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C)\ngreater than the weighted multimodel mean. On a regional basis,\nannual extremes (Table 6.5) are consistently projected to rise\nfaster than annual averages (Table 6.4). Future changes in \u201cvery\nrare\u201d extremes are also striking; by late century, current 1-in-20\nyear maximums are projected to occur every year, while current\n1-in-20 year minimums are not expected to occur at all.44\nThe frequency and intensity of cold waves is projected to decrease\nwhile the frequency and intensity of heat waves is projected to\nincrease throughout the century. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile) will\ndecrease the most in Alaska and the least in the Northeast while\nthe frequency of heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile) will increase in all regions, particularly\nthe Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska. By mid-century, decreases in\nthe frequency of cold waves are similar across RCPs whereas increases\nin the frequency of heat waves are about 50% greater in the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5) than the lower scenario (RCP4.5).45\nThe intensity of cold\nwaves is projected to decrease while the intensity of heat waves\nis projected to increase, dramatically so under RCP8.5. By mid-century,\nboth extreme cold waves and extreme heat waves (5-day, 1-in-10 year\nevents) are projected to have temperature increases of at least\n11.0\u00b0F (6.1\u00b0C) nationwide, with larger increases in northern regions\n(the Northeast, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, and Northwest; Table\n6.5).\nFigure 6.9\nProjected changes in the number of days per year with a maximum\ntemperature above 90\u00b0F and a minimum temperature below 32\u00b0F in the\ncontiguous United States. Changes are the difference between the\naverage for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario (RCP8.5). Maps in the top row\ndepict the weighted multimodel mean whereas maps on the bottom row\ndepict the mean of the three warmest models (that is, the models\nwith the largest temperature increase). Maps are derived from 32\nclimate model projections that were statistically downscaled using\nthe Localized Constructed Analogs technique.51\nChanges are statistically\nsignificant in all areas (that is, more than 50% of the models show\na statistically significant change, and more than 67% agree on the\nsign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC and NOAA NCEI).\nThere are large projected changes in the number of days exceeding\nkey temperature thresholds throughout the contiguous United States.\nFor instance, there are about 20\u201330 more days per year with a maximum\nover 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century under RCP8.5, with\nincreases of 40\u201350 days in much of the Southeast (Figure 6.9). The\nupper bound for projected changes is very roughly 10 days greater\nthan the weighted multimodel mean. Consistent with widespread\nwarming, there are 20\u201330 fewer days per year with a minimum temperature\nbelow freezing in the northern and eastern parts of the nation,\nwith decreases of more than 40\u201350 days in much the West. The upper\nbound for projected changes in freezing events is very roughly 10\u201320\ndays fewer than the weighted multimodel mean in many areas.\nReferences\nModal\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n1800 G Street, NW, Suite 9100, Washington, DC 20006 USA\nTel: +1 202.223.6262 | Fax: +1 202.223.3065\nContact Us \u2022\nCredits \u2022\nPrivacy Policy \u2022\nSite Map\nSome figures and images are copyright protected.\nPermission of the copyright owner must be obtained\nbefore making use of copyrighted material."

      "China's Respiratory Illness Concerns Explained\nA rise in respiratory illnesses in China, particularly among children, has made headlines over the past few weeks, with global health authorities trying to estimate the scale and severity of illness.\nOn November 13, 2023, China's National Health Commission reported an increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases in China, stressing the need for enhanced disease surveillance in healthcare and community settings, and strengthened health system capacity.\nWith some hospitals reporting large numbers of cases, and other nations making preparations should illnesses spread, Newsweek has summarized the story so far and what the relative risk within China and across the globe may be.\nWhat Illnesses Have Been Reported and What Are the Symptoms?\nChinese state media Global Times reported earlier this week that the country's National Health Commission said the cases were mainly influenza, alongside mycoplasma pneumonia, rhinovirus infections, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and other illnesses.\nExperts say China's stringent anti-COVID measures, which were dropped less than a year ago, left children's immune systems unprepared, resulting in the preponderance of younger patients. No major rise in deaths has been reported.\nScientists outside of China have attempted to assess the patterns of illness independently. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia, told the Science Media Centre on November 22 that the illness in children was a fever with no cough or other symptoms although, in some cases, pulmonary nodules had been seen on chest x-rays.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause,\" Hunter said.\n\"Pulmonary nodules in children are seen in pneumococcal pneumonia and cough may be absent. Influenza can catch patchy changes on chest X-ray, often due to secondary bacterial infections so [that] could also be in the frame.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause.\"\nHunter added that it did not sound like an epidemic due to a novel virus, adding that he would \"expect to see many more infections in adults\" in that case.\nNonetheless, some concerns have grown that older Chinese residents may come into contact with pathogens during family gatherings later in the year.\nThe pattern of China's outbreak suggests it began several months ago, Chinese health experts told various state media publications this week. They expect cases to peak in the next 2-3 weeks, but infections could last through next spring.\nHealth officials have urged the public to get vaccinated for relevant diseases.\nHow Many People Have Been Affected and Where?\nWhile there have been localized reports from hospitals across China, the total number of patients across the country isn't clear.\nChinese state media has reported that in Taizhou in East China's Zhejiang province, as of Friday, November 24, the positive rate of influenza virus in outpatient cases in the city had increased to 50 percent.\nThe Tianjin Children's Hospital, located in a major port city near the capital Beijing, reported on November 18 a single-day record of 13,171 young patients across its outpatient and emergency departments, according to a local newspaper. The geographical spread of cases, spanning over 400 miles from Beijing to Liaoning, suggested a wider outbreak that began in northern China.\nLast week, state-run CCTV news reported that in the capital of Beijing, hospitals had been operating at full capacity for over a month in response to this spike in infection. Beijing Children's Hospital revealed that its internal medicine department had seen more than 7,000 cases daily. Beijing Jingdu Children's Hospital highlighted a significant rise in mycoplasma pneumonia infections, placing immense pressure on medical resources, with 90 percent of the hospital's 300 beds occupied and long queues forming outside.\nOn November 21, Chinese media and ProMed, the alert system known for its role in bringing attention to the coronavirus outbreak in 2019, reported that there had been clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia among children in northern China, although it was unclear if this was related to the reported respiratory outbreaks.\nProMed first reported numerous children being admitted to hospitals with high fevers but without typical pneumonia symptoms.\nIn northern China, which appears to be experiencing the worst of the outbreak, respiratory infections have surged for five consecutive weeks, accounting for 6.2 percent of outpatient and emergency visits, at a rate 2.5 times the average of the past three years, Lo Yi-chun, the deputy director of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Sunday, citing World Health Organization (WHO) data.\nHealth authorities such as the WHO have repeatedly asked China for further epidemiological data.\nDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO's Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention, said on Thursday: \"We are following up with the situation in China and again, they have seen overall an increase in acute respiratory infections due to a number of different pathogens, including influenza, which is on the rise.\"\nShe continued, \"Mycoplasma pneumonia was on the rise for the last couple of months and now seems to be a little bit on the decline. We are following up through our clinical networks and working clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics which is a problem across the world.\"\nWhat's the Relative Risk to Other Parts of the World?\nThe Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Saturday that the island's ports and airports were all put on \"high alert.\" Notices were placed at these locations urging travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to seek medical attention if symptomatic, and disclose their travel history to healthcare providers.\nFang Chi-Tai, a professor at the Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at National Taiwan University, told Newsweek on Monday that Taiwan had heightened disease surveillance and recommends preventive measures such as mask-wearing as well as maintaining personal hygiene upon arrival in China.\nTaiwan's public health authority said individuals planning trips to China should consider receiving vaccines for COVID and influenza at the earliest opportunity.\nNearby nations such as India and Vietnam have said that while they are not seeing an uptick in cases, their health systems are preparing and have reached out to health authorities such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for advice.\nHowever, the relative risk according to experts appears to be low. Speaking to healthcare publication STAT, the WHO's Van Kerkhove reiterated the view that the spike in cases was due to an immunity gap in China, following the lifting of COVID restrictions, and was something most other countries had already dealt with.\n\"This is not an indication of a novel pathogen. This is expected,\" Kerkhove said.\n\"This is what most countries dealt with a year or two ago.\n\"We asked about comparisons prior to the pandemic. And the waves that they're seeing now, the peak is not as high as what they saw in 2018-2019.\"\nSpeaking to CNN, Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said the cases should not cause global concern.\n\"The spikes are \"not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries,\" according to WHO, she said.\n\"Importantly, no new pathogen has been detected. There has also been no unusual clinical presentation with children appearing much sicker than normal.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSeth Moulton Faces Protest in Hometown After Controversial Trans Remarks\n\nFox News Host Confronts Mike Johnson With GOP Demand for Matt Gaetz Report\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nWhat Will Trump's New Term Mean for A.I.?\nAbout the writer\n\n\n\nThe Debate\n\nTrump's War on the D.C.

      "China's Respiratory Illness Concerns Explained\nA rise in respiratory illnesses in China, particularly among children, has made headlines over the past few weeks, with global health authorities trying to estimate the scale and severity of illness.\nOn November 13, 2023, China's National Health Commission reported an increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases in China, stressing the need for enhanced disease surveillance in healthcare and community settings, and strengthened health system capacity.\nWith some hospitals reporting large numbers of cases, and other nations making preparations should illnesses spread, Newsweek has summarized the story so far and what the relative risk within China and across the globe may be.\nWhat Illnesses Have Been Reported and What Are the Symptoms?\nChinese state media Global Times reported earlier this week that the country's National Health Commission said the cases were mainly influenza, alongside mycoplasma pneumonia, rhinovirus infections, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and other illnesses.\nExperts say China's stringent anti-COVID measures, which were dropped less than a year ago, left children's immune systems unprepared, resulting in the preponderance of younger patients. No major rise in deaths has been reported.\nScientists outside of China have attempted to assess the patterns of illness independently. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia, told the Science Media Centre on November 22 that the illness in children was a fever with no cough or other symptoms although, in some cases, pulmonary nodules had been seen on chest x-rays.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause,\" Hunter said.\n\"Pulmonary nodules in children are seen in pneumococcal pneumonia and cough may be absent. Influenza can catch patchy changes on chest X-ray, often due to secondary bacterial infections so [that] could also be in the frame.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause.\"\nHunter added that it did not sound like an epidemic due to a novel virus, adding that he would \"expect to see many more infections in adults\" in that case.\nNonetheless, some concerns have grown that older Chinese residents may come into contact with pathogens during family gatherings later in the year.\nThe pattern of China's outbreak suggests it began several months ago, Chinese health experts told various state media publications this week. They expect cases to peak in the next 2-3 weeks, but infections could last through next spring.\nHealth officials have urged the public to get vaccinated for relevant diseases.\nHow Many People Have Been Affected and Where?\nWhile there have been localized reports from hospitals across China, the total number of patients across the country isn't clear.\nChinese state media has reported that in Taizhou in East China's Zhejiang province, as of Friday, November 24, the positive rate of influenza virus in outpatient cases in the city had increased to 50 percent.\nThe Tianjin Children's Hospital, located in a major port city near the capital Beijing, reported on November 18 a single-day record of 13,171 young patients across its outpatient and emergency departments, according to a local newspaper. The geographical spread of cases, spanning over 400 miles from Beijing to Liaoning, suggested a wider outbreak that began in northern China.\nLast week, state-run CCTV news reported that in the capital of Beijing, hospitals had been operating at full capacity for over a month in response to this spike in infection. Beijing Children's Hospital revealed that its internal medicine department had seen more than 7,000 cases daily. Beijing Jingdu Children's Hospital highlighted a significant rise in mycoplasma pneumonia infections, placing immense pressure on medical resources, with 90 percent of the hospital's 300 beds occupied and long queues forming outside.\nOn November 21, Chinese media and ProMed, the alert system known for its role in bringing attention to the coronavirus outbreak in 2019, reported that there had been clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia among children in northern China, although it was unclear if this was related to the reported respiratory outbreaks.\nProMed first reported numerous children being admitted to hospitals with high fevers but without typical pneumonia symptoms.\nIn northern China, which appears to be experiencing the worst of the outbreak, respiratory infections have surged for five consecutive weeks, accounting for 6.2 percent of outpatient and emergency visits, at a rate 2.5 times the average of the past three years, Lo Yi-chun, the deputy director of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Sunday, citing World Health Organization (WHO) data.\nHealth authorities such as the WHO have repeatedly asked China for further epidemiological data.\nDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO's Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention, said on Thursday: \"We are following up with the situation in China and again, they have seen overall an increase in acute respiratory infections due to a number of different pathogens, including influenza, which is on the rise.\"\nShe continued, \"Mycoplasma pneumonia was on the rise for the last couple of months and now seems to be a little bit on the decline. We are following up through our clinical networks and working clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics which is a problem across the world.\"\nWhat's the Relative Risk to Other Parts of the World?\nThe Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Saturday that the island's ports and airports were all put on \"high alert.\" Notices were placed at these locations urging travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to seek medical attention if symptomatic, and disclose their travel history to healthcare providers.\nFang Chi-Tai, a professor at the Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at National Taiwan University, told Newsweek on Monday that Taiwan had heightened disease surveillance and recommends preventive measures such as mask-wearing as well as maintaining personal hygiene upon arrival in China.\nTaiwan's public health authority said individuals planning trips to China should consider receiving vaccines for COVID and influenza at the earliest opportunity.\nNearby nations such as India and Vietnam have said that while they are not seeing an uptick in cases, their health systems are preparing and have reached out to health authorities such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for advice.\nHowever, the relative risk according to experts appears to be low. Speaking to healthcare publication STAT, the WHO's Van Kerkhove reiterated the view that the spike in cases was due to an immunity gap in China, following the lifting of COVID restrictions, and was something most other countries had already dealt with.\n\"This is not an indication of a novel pathogen. This is expected,\" Kerkhove said.\n\"This is what most countries dealt with a year or two ago.\n\"We asked about comparisons prior to the pandemic. And the waves that they're seeing now, the peak is not as high as what they saw in 2018-2019.\"\nSpeaking to CNN, Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said the cases should not cause global concern.\n\"The spikes are \"not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries,\" according to WHO, she said.\n\"Importantly, no new pathogen has been detected. There has also been no unusual clinical presentation with children appearing much sicker than normal.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSeth Moulton Faces Protest in Hometown After Controversial Trans Remarks\n\nFox News Host Confronts Mike Johnson With GOP Demand for Matt Gaetz Report\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nWhat Will Trump's New Term Mean for A.I.?\nAbout the writer\n\n\n\nThe Debate\n\nTrump's War on the D.C.

      "China's Respiratory Illness Concerns Explained\nA rise in respiratory illnesses in China, particularly among children, has made headlines over the past few weeks, with global health authorities trying to estimate the scale and severity of illness.\nOn November 13, 2023, China's National Health Commission reported an increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases in China, stressing the need for enhanced disease surveillance in healthcare and community settings, and strengthened health system capacity.\nWith some hospitals reporting large numbers of cases, and other nations making preparations should illnesses spread, Newsweek has summarized the story so far and what the relative risk within China and across the globe may be.\nWhat Illnesses Have Been Reported and What Are the Symptoms?\nChinese state media Global Times reported earlier this week that the country's National Health Commission said the cases were mainly influenza, alongside mycoplasma pneumonia, rhinovirus infections, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and other illnesses.\nExperts say China's stringent anti-COVID measures, which were dropped less than a year ago, left children's immune systems unprepared, resulting in the preponderance of younger patients. No major rise in deaths has been reported.\nScientists outside of China have attempted to assess the patterns of illness independently. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia, told the Science Media Centre on November 22 that the illness in children was a fever with no cough or other symptoms although, in some cases, pulmonary nodules had been seen on chest x-rays.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause,\" Hunter said.\n\"Pulmonary nodules in children are seen in pneumococcal pneumonia and cough may be absent. Influenza can catch patchy changes on chest X-ray, often due to secondary bacterial infections so [that] could also be in the frame.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause.\"\nHunter added that it did not sound like an epidemic due to a novel virus, adding that he would \"expect to see many more infections in adults\" in that case.\nNonetheless, some concerns have grown that older Chinese residents may come into contact with pathogens during family gatherings later in the year.\nThe pattern of China's outbreak suggests it began several months ago, Chinese health experts told various state media publications this week. They expect cases to peak in the next 2-3 weeks, but infections could last through next spring.\nHealth officials have urged the public to get vaccinated for relevant diseases.\nHow Many People Have Been Affected and Where?\nWhile there have been localized reports from hospitals across China, the total number of patients across the country isn't clear.\nChinese state media has reported that in Taizhou in East China's Zhejiang province, as of Friday, November 24, the positive rate of influenza virus in outpatient cases in the city had increased to 50 percent.\nThe Tianjin Children's Hospital, located in a major port city near the capital Beijing, reported on November 18 a single-day record of 13,171 young patients across its outpatient and emergency departments, according to a local newspaper. The geographical spread of cases, spanning over 400 miles from Beijing to Liaoning, suggested a wider outbreak that began in northern China.\nLast week, state-run CCTV news reported that in the capital of Beijing, hospitals had been operating at full capacity for over a month in response to this spike in infection. Beijing Children's Hospital revealed that its internal medicine department had seen more than 7,000 cases daily. Beijing Jingdu Children's Hospital highlighted a significant rise in mycoplasma pneumonia infections, placing immense pressure on medical resources, with 90 percent of the hospital's 300 beds occupied and long queues forming outside.\nOn November 21, Chinese media and ProMed, the alert system known for its role in bringing attention to the coronavirus outbreak in 2019, reported that there had been clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia among children in northern China, although it was unclear if this was related to the reported respiratory outbreaks.\nProMed first reported numerous children being admitted to hospitals with high fevers but without typical pneumonia symptoms.\nIn northern China, which appears to be experiencing the worst of the outbreak, respiratory infections have surged for five consecutive weeks, accounting for 6.2 percent of outpatient and emergency visits, at a rate 2.5 times the average of the past three years, Lo Yi-chun, the deputy director of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Sunday, citing World Health Organization (WHO) data.\nHealth authorities such as the WHO have repeatedly asked China for further epidemiological data.\nDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO's Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention, said on Thursday: \"We are following up with the situation in China and again, they have seen overall an increase in acute respiratory infections due to a number of different pathogens, including influenza, which is on the rise.\"\nShe continued, \"Mycoplasma pneumonia was on the rise for the last couple of months and now seems to be a little bit on the decline. We are following up through our clinical networks and working clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics which is a problem across the world.\"\nWhat's the Relative Risk to Other Parts of the World?\nThe Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Saturday that the island's ports and airports were all put on \"high alert.\" Notices were placed at these locations urging travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to seek medical attention if symptomatic, and disclose their travel history to healthcare providers.\nFang Chi-Tai, a professor at the Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at National Taiwan University, told Newsweek on Monday that Taiwan had heightened disease surveillance and recommends preventive measures such as mask-wearing as well as maintaining personal hygiene upon arrival in China.\nTaiwan's public health authority said individuals planning trips to China should consider receiving vaccines for COVID and influenza at the earliest opportunity.\nNearby nations such as India and Vietnam have said that while they are not seeing an uptick in cases, their health systems are preparing and have reached out to health authorities such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for advice.\nHowever, the relative risk according to experts appears to be low. Speaking to healthcare publication STAT, the WHO's Van Kerkhove reiterated the view that the spike in cases was due to an immunity gap in China, following the lifting of COVID restrictions, and was something most other countries had already dealt with.\n\"This is not an indication of a novel pathogen. This is expected,\" Kerkhove said.\n\"This is what most countries dealt with a year or two ago.\n\"We asked about comparisons prior to the pandemic. And the waves that they're seeing now, the peak is not as high as what they saw in 2018-2019.\"\nSpeaking to CNN, Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said the cases should not cause global concern.\n\"The spikes are \"not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries,\" according to WHO, she said.\n\"Importantly, no new pathogen has been detected. There has also been no unusual clinical presentation with children appearing much sicker than normal.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSeth Moulton Faces Protest in Hometown After Controversial Trans Remarks\n\nFox News Host Confronts Mike Johnson With GOP Demand for Matt Gaetz Report\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nWhat Will Trump's New Term Mean for A.I.?\nAbout the writer\n\n\n\nThe Debate\n\nTrump's War on the D.C.

      "PERSONAL STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION ON RESPIRATORY HEALTH: ADVICE FOR PROVIDERS, PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC Carlsten C, Salvi S, Wong GWK, et al. Eur Respir J 2020; 55: INTRODUCTION The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes air pollution and climate change as a global threat to human health. Figure 1 summarizes the health burden of air pollution. There is a need to empower the public with strategies to minimize the effects of air pollution on respiratory health. It is recommended that healthcare professionals (HCPs) should help vulnerable patients protect themselves from the effects of air pollution by suggesting impact-reducing strategies that are backed by scientific evidence.\nOBJECTIVE AND METHODOLOGY To provide recommendations to assist providers and public health officials when advising patients and the public regarding personal-level strategies to mitigate risk imposed by air pollution. A literature search was performed to identify peer-reviewed scientific evidence that addressed the effectiveness of personal-level interventions to reduce exposure to air pollution, as well as the role therein of Effect Modifiers such as diet and lifestyle. SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTION The key elements in mitigating air pollution exposure and protecting respiratory health are summarized in figure 2. The population at high risk which include susceptible individuals such as those with chronic pulmonary conditions, at extremes of age and pregnant women, may benefit more from the suggested mitigation strategies.\nFigure 1: Health burden of air pollution Figure 2: Key elements in mitigating exposure and protecting respiratory health Mitigation strategies for Ambient exposure Mitigation strategies for Household exposure Effect modifiers: Interventions to modify individual risk factors Face masks Active transport Low air pollution routes Vehicle settings Plan exercise Local air forecast Clean fuel and stoves Ventilate homes Air cleaners Treat & manage respiratory conditions Reduce obesity, promote physical avtivity, smoking cessation and avoidance of second-hand smoke Healthy balanced diet \u22489 million annual deaths from global air pollution >99% of deaths due to household air pollution 90% of deaths due to ambient air pollution (low and middle-income contries) 25% of premature deaths associated with air pollution are respiratory in nature EVIDENCE-BASED* RECOMMENDATIONS TO MINIMIZE PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION Mitigation strategy Recommendation and evidence Use facemasks under appropriate circumstances(Evidence grade C) Evidence that N95 facemask use has an impact on cardiopulmonary health is limited. Close fitting N-95 masks (defined as filtering >95% of 0.3 \u00b5m particles under test conditions) are recommended when exposure to ambient air pollution exceeds recommended levels.\nManufacturers\u2019 guidance on correct mask usage, maintenance and fit, including a user seal check should be strictly followed. People with chronic respiratory, cardiac or other conditions that make breathing difficult should use an N95 facemask under strict medical supervision.\nCloth masks are far inferior to N-95 masks.\nShift from motorized to active transport (like cycling and walking) whenever possible (evidence grade C) The benefits of physical activity with active transport appears to outweigh the risks associated with the increased inhaled dose of air pollutants and a mortality benefit of physical activity even in high air pollution environments.\nInfrastructure should be designed to prioritize active transportation and make age-appropriate accommodations.\nChoose travel routes that minimize near-road air pollution exposure (evidence grade C) Provide information on how to minimize exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) by: Prioritizing low air pollution routes, integrated with cycling and walking plans, avoid major intersections, and higher-emission sides of a given road.\nMobile phone applications can help plan the travel routes.\nAn initiative funded by GSK Consumer Healthcare Summary-article-D3.indd 1 Summary-article-D3.indd 1 07-10-2020 22:30:01 07-10-2020 22:30:01 * Level-of-evidence score is based on the grading used in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) report A = Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta analyses with rich body of data, B = (RCTs) and meta analyses with limited body of data, C = Nonrandomized trials and observational studies, D= Panel consensus judgment Optimize driving style and vehicle settings (evidence grade D) Maintain optimum vehicle filtration/ventilation and, when in conditions of high air pollution, drive with windows closed and keep the air on internal circulation (reduces in-vehicle particle concentrations by up to 75%).\nModerate outdoor physical activity when and where air pollution levels are high (evidence grade C) High risk individuals (those susceptible to cardiopulmonary disease) can reduce their exposure to air pollutants by staying indoors on high pollution days and limiting outdoor physical activity near sources of air pollution. Advise to decrease or stop exercising if concerning symptoms such as coughing, chest tightness or wheezing are noticed.\nMonitor air pollution levels (evidence grade D) Conflicting data exists on efficacy of Air Quality Index alerts and wearable technology in increasing air pollution-protective behavior.\nPatients, especially those with underlying susceptibility, should be aware of air quality alerts and learn to implement appropriate protective behavior on high air pollution days.\nMitigation strategy Recommendation and evidence EVIDENCE-BASED* RECOMMENDATIONS TO MINIMIZE PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION Use clean fuels (evidence grade C), optimize household ventilation (evidence grade C) and adopt efficient cookstoves where possible (evidence grade D) Replacing biomass fuels with cleaner cooking fuels (LPG or electricity) combined with improved kitchen ventilation reduces the risk of acute respiratory infection, reduces respiratory symptoms and shortens the hospital stays versus persistent solid fuel users.\nImproved ventilation in cooking areas with cross-ventilation (opening windows or doors), chimneys or exhaust fans significantly improves respiratory health.\nUse portable air cleaners as an indoor environmental intervention (evidence grade C) Portable air cleaners in homes improve outcomes and HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters also improve symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis.\nAir-cleaning technologies that may emit harmful byproducts should be avoided and air cleaners should be placed where the most vulnerable occupants spend most of their time.\nMitigation strategy Recommendation and evidence EFFECT MODIFIER\u2019S: INTERVENTIONS TO MODIFY INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS TO PROTECT RESPIRATORY HEALTH Treat and manage respiratory conditions (evidence grade D) Maximize control of airway disease through optimized care (e.g. symptom and airflow monitoring, medications, and vaccinations).\nPromote primary, secondary and tertiary interventions to attenuate the burden of cardiopulmonary disease associated with air pollution exposure. Includes reducing obesity, promoting physical activity, smoking cessation and avoidance of second-hand smoke.\nModify diet and supplement with antioxidants or anti-inflammatory agents (evidence grade D) A healthy, balanced diet (rich in antioxidants, fiber, protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids) is associated with reductions in the risk of chronic lung diseases known to be compounded by air pollution.\nDo not recommend taking any dietary supplements as none has been shown convincingly to have such benefits.\nStrategy Recommendation and evidence SUMMARY The negative impact of air pollution on respiratory health is well documented.\nMitigation strategies (as tabulated in the article) need to be tailored to the individual dependent on their levels of air pollution exposure, susceptibilities to air pollution exposure, health literacy, financial resources and support networks.\nEvidence-based, practical recommendations should serve as a useful reference for advising patients and the public on individual-level interventions to reduce exposure to air pollution and mitigate the associated respiratory health risks.\nPM-GL-NOBRA-20-00004 Access the full article for more information on https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/55/6/1902056.\nSummary-article-D3.indd 2 Summary-article-D3.indd 2 07-10-2020 22:30:02 07-10-2020 22:30:02"

      "China's Respiratory Illness Concerns Explained\nA rise in respiratory illnesses in China, particularly among children, has made headlines over the past few weeks, with global health authorities trying to estimate the scale and severity of illness.\nOn November 13, 2023, China's National Health Commission reported an increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases in China, stressing the need for enhanced disease surveillance in healthcare and community settings, and strengthened health system capacity.\nWith some hospitals reporting large numbers of cases, and other nations making preparations should illnesses spread, Newsweek has summarized the story so far and what the relative risk within China and across the globe may be.\nWhat Illnesses Have Been Reported and What Are the Symptoms?\nChinese state media Global Times reported earlier this week that the country's National Health Commission said the cases were mainly influenza, alongside mycoplasma pneumonia, rhinovirus infections, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and other illnesses.\nExperts say China's stringent anti-COVID measures, which were dropped less than a year ago, left children's immune systems unprepared, resulting in the preponderance of younger patients. No major rise in deaths has been reported.\nScientists outside of China have attempted to assess the patterns of illness independently. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia, told the Science Media Centre on November 22 that the illness in children was a fever with no cough or other symptoms although, in some cases, pulmonary nodules had been seen on chest x-rays.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause,\" Hunter said.\n\"Pulmonary nodules in children are seen in pneumococcal pneumonia and cough may be absent. Influenza can catch patchy changes on chest X-ray, often due to secondary bacterial infections so [that] could also be in the frame.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause.\"\nHunter added that it did not sound like an epidemic due to a novel virus, adding that he would \"expect to see many more infections in adults\" in that case.\nNonetheless, some concerns have grown that older Chinese residents may come into contact with pathogens during family gatherings later in the year.\nThe pattern of China's outbreak suggests it began several months ago, Chinese health experts told various state media publications this week. They expect cases to peak in the next 2-3 weeks, but infections could last through next spring.\nHealth officials have urged the public to get vaccinated for relevant diseases.\nHow Many People Have Been Affected and Where?\nWhile there have been localized reports from hospitals across China, the total number of patients across the country isn't clear.\nChinese state media has reported that in Taizhou in East China's Zhejiang province, as of Friday, November 24, the positive rate of influenza virus in outpatient cases in the city had increased to 50 percent.\nThe Tianjin Children's Hospital, located in a major port city near the capital Beijing, reported on November 18 a single-day record of 13,171 young patients across its outpatient and emergency departments, according to a local newspaper. The geographical spread of cases, spanning over 400 miles from Beijing to Liaoning, suggested a wider outbreak that began in northern China.\nLast week, state-run CCTV news reported that in the capital of Beijing, hospitals had been operating at full capacity for over a month in response to this spike in infection. Beijing Children's Hospital revealed that its internal medicine department had seen more than 7,000 cases daily. Beijing Jingdu Children's Hospital highlighted a significant rise in mycoplasma pneumonia infections, placing immense pressure on medical resources, with 90 percent of the hospital's 300 beds occupied and long queues forming outside.\nOn November 21, Chinese media and ProMed, the alert system known for its role in bringing attention to the coronavirus outbreak in 2019, reported that there had been clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia among children in northern China, although it was unclear if this was related to the reported respiratory outbreaks.\nProMed first reported numerous children being admitted to hospitals with high fevers but without typical pneumonia symptoms.\nIn northern China, which appears to be experiencing the worst of the outbreak, respiratory infections have surged for five consecutive weeks, accounting for 6.2 percent of outpatient and emergency visits, at a rate 2.5 times the average of the past three years, Lo Yi-chun, the deputy director of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Sunday, citing World Health Organization (WHO) data.\nHealth authorities such as the WHO have repeatedly asked China for further epidemiological data.\nDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO's Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention, said on Thursday: \"We are following up with the situation in China and again, they have seen overall an increase in acute respiratory infections due to a number of different pathogens, including influenza, which is on the rise.\"\nShe continued, \"Mycoplasma pneumonia was on the rise for the last couple of months and now seems to be a little bit on the decline. We are following up through our clinical networks and working clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics which is a problem across the world.\"\nWhat's the Relative Risk to Other Parts of the World?\nThe Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Saturday that the island's ports and airports were all put on \"high alert.\" Notices were placed at these locations urging travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to seek medical attention if symptomatic, and disclose their travel history to healthcare providers.\nFang Chi-Tai, a professor at the Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at National Taiwan University, told Newsweek on Monday that Taiwan had heightened disease surveillance and recommends preventive measures such as mask-wearing as well as maintaining personal hygiene upon arrival in China.\nTaiwan's public health authority said individuals planning trips to China should consider receiving vaccines for COVID and influenza at the earliest opportunity.\nNearby nations such as India and Vietnam have said that while they are not seeing an uptick in cases, their health systems are preparing and have reached out to health authorities such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for advice.\nHowever, the relative risk according to experts appears to be low. Speaking to healthcare publication STAT, the WHO's Van Kerkhove reiterated the view that the spike in cases was due to an immunity gap in China, following the lifting of COVID restrictions, and was something most other countries had already dealt with.\n\"This is not an indication of a novel pathogen. This is expected,\" Kerkhove said.\n\"This is what most countries dealt with a year or two ago.\n\"We asked about comparisons prior to the pandemic. And the waves that they're seeing now, the peak is not as high as what they saw in 2018-2019.\"\nSpeaking to CNN, Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said the cases should not cause global concern.\n\"The spikes are \"not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries,\" according to WHO, she said.\n\"Importantly, no new pathogen has been detected. There has also been no unusual clinical presentation with children appearing much sicker than normal.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSeth Moulton Faces Protest in Hometown After Controversial Trans Remarks\n\nFox News Host Confronts Mike Johnson With GOP Demand for Matt Gaetz Report\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nWhat Will Trump's New Term Mean for A.I.?\nAbout the writer\n\n\n\nThe Debate\n\nTrump's War on the D.C.

      "PERSONAL STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION ON RESPIRATORY HEALTH: ADVICE FOR PROVIDERS, PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC Carlsten C, Salvi S, Wong GWK, et al. Eur Respir J 2020; 55: INTRODUCTION The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes air pollution and climate change as a global threat to human health. Figure 1 summarizes the health burden of air pollution. There is a need to empower the public with strategies to minimize the effects of air pollution on respiratory health. It is recommended that healthcare professionals (HCPs) should help vulnerable patients protect themselves from the effects of air pollution by suggesting impact-reducing strategies that are backed by scientific evidence.\nOBJECTIVE AND METHODOLOGY To provide recommendations to assist providers and public health officials when advising patients and the public regarding personal-level strategies to mitigate risk imposed by air pollution. A literature search was performed to identify peer-reviewed scientific evidence that addressed the effectiveness of personal-level interventions to reduce exposure to air pollution, as well as the role therein of Effect Modifiers such as diet and lifestyle. SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTION The key elements in mitigating air pollution exposure and protecting respiratory health are summarized in figure 2. The population at high risk which include susceptible individuals such as those with chronic pulmonary conditions, at extremes of age and pregnant women, may benefit more from the suggested mitigation strategies.\nFigure 1: Health burden of air pollution Figure 2: Key elements in mitigating exposure and protecting respiratory health Mitigation strategies for Ambient exposure Mitigation strategies for Household exposure Effect modifiers: Interventions to modify individual risk factors Face masks Active transport Low air pollution routes Vehicle settings Plan exercise Local air forecast Clean fuel and stoves Ventilate homes Air cleaners Treat & manage respiratory conditions Reduce obesity, promote physical avtivity, smoking cessation and avoidance of second-hand smoke Healthy balanced diet \u22489 million annual deaths from global air pollution >99% of deaths due to household air pollution 90% of deaths due to ambient air pollution (low and middle-income contries) 25% of premature deaths associated with air pollution are respiratory in nature EVIDENCE-BASED* RECOMMENDATIONS TO MINIMIZE PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION Mitigation strategy Recommendation and evidence Use facemasks under appropriate circumstances(Evidence grade C) Evidence that N95 facemask use has an impact on cardiopulmonary health is limited. Close fitting N-95 masks (defined as filtering >95% of 0.3 \u00b5m particles under test conditions) are recommended when exposure to ambient air pollution exceeds recommended levels.\nManufacturers\u2019 guidance on correct mask usage, maintenance and fit, including a user seal check should be strictly followed. People with chronic respiratory, cardiac or other conditions that make breathing difficult should use an N95 facemask under strict medical supervision.\nCloth masks are far inferior to N-95 masks.\nShift from motorized to active transport (like cycling and walking) whenever possible (evidence grade C) The benefits of physical activity with active transport appears to outweigh the risks associated with the increased inhaled dose of air pollutants and a mortality benefit of physical activity even in high air pollution environments.\nInfrastructure should be designed to prioritize active transportation and make age-appropriate accommodations.\nChoose travel routes that minimize near-road air pollution exposure (evidence grade C) Provide information on how to minimize exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) by: Prioritizing low air pollution routes, integrated with cycling and walking plans, avoid major intersections, and higher-emission sides of a given road.\nMobile phone applications can help plan the travel routes.\nAn initiative funded by GSK Consumer Healthcare Summary-article-D3.indd 1 Summary-article-D3.indd 1 07-10-2020 22:30:01 07-10-2020 22:30:01 * Level-of-evidence score is based on the grading used in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) report A = Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta analyses with rich body of data, B = (RCTs) and meta analyses with limited body of data, C = Nonrandomized trials and observational studies, D= Panel consensus judgment Optimize driving style and vehicle settings (evidence grade D) Maintain optimum vehicle filtration/ventilation and, when in conditions of high air pollution, drive with windows closed and keep the air on internal circulation (reduces in-vehicle particle concentrations by up to 75%).\nModerate outdoor physical activity when and where air pollution levels are high (evidence grade C) High risk individuals (those susceptible to cardiopulmonary disease) can reduce their exposure to air pollutants by staying indoors on high pollution days and limiting outdoor physical activity near sources of air pollution. Advise to decrease or stop exercising if concerning symptoms such as coughing, chest tightness or wheezing are noticed.\nMonitor air pollution levels (evidence grade D) Conflicting data exists on efficacy of Air Quality Index alerts and wearable technology in increasing air pollution-protective behavior.\nPatients, especially those with underlying susceptibility, should be aware of air quality alerts and learn to implement appropriate protective behavior on high air pollution days.\nMitigation strategy Recommendation and evidence EVIDENCE-BASED* RECOMMENDATIONS TO MINIMIZE PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION Use clean fuels (evidence grade C), optimize household ventilation (evidence grade C) and adopt efficient cookstoves where possible (evidence grade D) Replacing biomass fuels with cleaner cooking fuels (LPG or electricity) combined with improved kitchen ventilation reduces the risk of acute respiratory infection, reduces respiratory symptoms and shortens the hospital stays versus persistent solid fuel users.\nImproved ventilation in cooking areas with cross-ventilation (opening windows or doors), chimneys or exhaust fans significantly improves respiratory health.\nUse portable air cleaners as an indoor environmental intervention (evidence grade C) Portable air cleaners in homes improve outcomes and HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters also improve symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis.\nAir-cleaning technologies that may emit harmful byproducts should be avoided and air cleaners should be placed where the most vulnerable occupants spend most of their time.\nMitigation strategy Recommendation and evidence EFFECT MODIFIER\u2019S: INTERVENTIONS TO MODIFY INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS TO PROTECT RESPIRATORY HEALTH Treat and manage respiratory conditions (evidence grade D) Maximize control of airway disease through optimized care (e.g. symptom and airflow monitoring, medications, and vaccinations).\nPromote primary, secondary and tertiary interventions to attenuate the burden of cardiopulmonary disease associated with air pollution exposure. Includes reducing obesity, promoting physical activity, smoking cessation and avoidance of second-hand smoke.\nModify diet and supplement with antioxidants or anti-inflammatory agents (evidence grade D) A healthy, balanced diet (rich in antioxidants, fiber, protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids) is associated with reductions in the risk of chronic lung diseases known to be compounded by air pollution.\nDo not recommend taking any dietary supplements as none has been shown convincingly to have such benefits.\nStrategy Recommendation and evidence SUMMARY The negative impact of air pollution on respiratory health is well documented.\nMitigation strategies (as tabulated in the article) need to be tailored to the individual dependent on their levels of air pollution exposure, susceptibilities to air pollution exposure, health literacy, financial resources and support networks.\nEvidence-based, practical recommendations should serve as a useful reference for advising patients and the public on individual-level interventions to reduce exposure to air pollution and mitigate the associated respiratory health risks.\nPM-GL-NOBRA-20-00004 Access the full article for more information on https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/55/6/1902056.\nSummary-article-D3.indd 2 Summary-article-D3.indd 2 07-10-2020 22:30:02 07-10-2020 22:30:02"

It identifies and explores the biggest trends in energy demand and supply, as well as what they mean for energy security, emissions and economic development.\nThis year\u2019s Outlook comes against a backdrop of escalating risks in the Middle East and heightened geopolitical tensions globally, and explores a range of energy security issues that decision makers face as they proceed with clean energy transitions. With rising investment of clean technologies and rapid growth in electricity demand, the WEO 2024 examines how far the world has come on its journey towards a safer and more sustainable energy system, and what more needs to be done to reach its climate goals.\nReflecting today\u2019s uncertainties, our three main scenarios are complemented with sensitivity cases for renewables, electric mobility, liquefied natural gas and how heatwaves, efficiency policies and the rise of artificial intelligence might affect the outlook for electricity.\nEnglish \nLanguage\n\nEnglish\nPolski\n\nPublished October 2024\nLicence CC BY 4.0 (report); CC BY NC SA 4.0 (Annex A)\nPress release\nLaunch live stream\nShare Cite\nOnline table of contents\n\n###### 1.0 Executive Summary Read online\n###### 2.0 Overview and key findings Read online\n###### 3.0 Context and scenario design Read online\n###### 4.0 Pathways for the energy mix Read online\n###### 5.0 Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook Read online\n###### 6.0 Security, affordability and sustainability Read online\n###### 7.0 Regional insights Read online\n###### 8.0 Regional dashboards Read online\n\nGlobal Energy and Climate Model\nThe Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model key input dataset includes selected key input data for all three modelled scenarios (STEPS, APS, NZE).

consumption! From 2001 to 2020, Texans have been burning through kilowatt-hours like theyre going out of style. With an average monthly electricity usage that could power a small city, its no wonder Texas is known for doing everything big \u2013 including its Kwh consumption. Lets take a closer look at how the Lone Star States energy habits have been lighting up the charts over the years.\nCommercial Electricity Usage\nInterpretation\nIt seems like Texas commercial establishments have been on a bit of a rollercoaster ride with their electricity consumption over the years. From the impressive 92,869 kWh per year back in 2014 to the relatively modest 6,817 kWh per month in 2003, it's clear that the Lone Star state knows how to keep things interesting when it comes to energy usage. Whether they're turning up the AC in the scorching Texas heat or keeping the lights on late into the night, one thing's for sure: Everything is bigger in Texas, including their electricity bills!\nResidential Electricity Usage\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in Texas, the only thing consuming more energy than the residents is the record of their electricity usage statistics! With a rollercoaster of numbers over the years, it's clear that Texans have a knack for keeping the lights on. Whether it's BBQ grills sizzling or AC units chilling, the Lone Star State sure knows how to power up. Maybe it's time to consider 'Switch Off Saturdays' or 'Watt Watching Wednesdays' to keep those numbers in check, but hey, at least they're consistent in one thing - consistently electrifying!\nTexas Electricity Consumption\nInterpretation\nIn a state where everything is bigger, it seems even our energy consumption doesn't hold back. With an average electricity usage of 12,216 kWh per capita in 2006, Texans prove that when it comes to power consumption, we don't just talk the talk, we kilowatt the kilowatt. So, if you ever thought everything was grand in Texas, just take a look at our electric bills for a shocking reality check.\nReferences\neia.gov\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

consumption! From 2001 to 2020, Texans have been burning through kilowatt-hours like theyre going out of style. With an average monthly electricity usage that could power a small city, its no wonder Texas is known for doing everything big \u2013 including its Kwh consumption. Lets take a closer look at how the Lone Star States energy habits have been lighting up the charts over the years.\nCommercial Electricity Usage\nInterpretation\nIt seems like Texas commercial establishments have been on a bit of a rollercoaster ride with their electricity consumption over the years. From the impressive 92,869 kWh per year back in 2014 to the relatively modest 6,817 kWh per month in 2003, it's clear that the Lone Star state knows how to keep things interesting when it comes to energy usage. Whether they're turning up the AC in the scorching Texas heat or keeping the lights on late into the night, one thing's for sure: Everything is bigger in Texas, including their electricity bills!\nResidential Electricity Usage\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in Texas, the only thing consuming more energy than the residents is the record of their electricity usage statistics! With a rollercoaster of numbers over the years, it's clear that Texans have a knack for keeping the lights on. Whether it's BBQ grills sizzling or AC units chilling, the Lone Star State sure knows how to power up. Maybe it's time to consider 'Switch Off Saturdays' or 'Watt Watching Wednesdays' to keep those numbers in check, but hey, at least they're consistent in one thing - consistently electrifying!\nTexas Electricity Consumption\nInterpretation\nIn a state where everything is bigger, it seems even our energy consumption doesn't hold back. With an average electricity usage of 12,216 kWh per capita in 2006, Texans prove that when it comes to power consumption, we don't just talk the talk, we kilowatt the kilowatt. So, if you ever thought everything was grand in Texas, just take a look at our electric bills for a shocking reality check.\nReferences\neia.gov\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\u00a0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals\u2014expanding some and shrinking others.\u00a0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget\u2014how much sunlight\u00a0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat\u2014over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\u00a0temperature readings\u00a0to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\u00a0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\u00a0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The \"coolest\" month was November, which was 1.35 \u02daF (0.75 \u02daC) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)\u2013the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86\u00b0C (1.55\u00b0F) above the 20th century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F). This value is 0.13\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02\u00b0C (0.04\u00b0F) higher than the last year's (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014\u20132022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's\u00a02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\u00a0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\u00a00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\u00a0Celsius)\u00a0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 \u00b0F (0.18 \u00b0C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities\u2014burning fossil fuels and clearing forests\u2014add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (\"representative concentration pathways,\" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns. (right)\u00a0 Projected temperature increase relative to the 1901-1960 average depending on which RCP we eventually follow. Image by Katharine Hayhoe, from the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nAccording to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,\u00a0 models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.\nReferences\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2023).

The average temperature for October 2024 was recorded at around 11 degrees Celsius, compared to 11.9 degrees a year before. In the broader context of climate change, average monthly temperatures are indicative of where the national climate is headed and whether attempts to control global warming are successful.\u00a0\nSummer and winter\nAverage summer temperature in Germany fluctuated in recent years, generally between 18 to 19 degrees Celsius. The seasons remain generally warm, and while there may not be as many hot and sunny days as in other parts of Europe, heat waves have occurred. In fact, 2023 saw 11.5 days with a temperature of at least 30 degrees, though this was a decrease compared to the year before. Meanwhile, average winter temperatures also fluctuated, but were higher in recent years, rising over four degrees on average in 2024. Figures remained in the above zero range since 2011. Numbers therefore suggest that German winters are becoming warmer, even if individual regions experiencing colder sub-zero snaps or even more snowfall may disagree.\u00a0\nRain, rain, go away\nAverage monthly precipitation varied depending on the season, though sometimes figures from different times of the year were comparable. In 2024, the average monthly precipitation was highest in May and September, although rainfalls might increase in October and November with the beginning of the cold season. In the past, torrential rains have led to catastrophic flooding in Germany, with one of the most devastating being the flood of July 2021. Germany is not immune to the weather changing between two extremes, e.g. very warm spring months mostly without rain, when rain might be wished for, and then increased precipitation in other months where dry weather might be better, for example during planting and harvest seasons. Climate change remains on the agenda in all its far-reaching ways.\u00a0\n\n                        Average monthly temperature in Germany from October 2023 to October 2024 \n                    \n                            (in Celsius)\n                        \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nOctober 2024\nGermany\nOctober 2023 to October 2024\nFigures for the months preceding October 2024 were retrieved from previous report editions of the German Meteorological Service.According to the source, figures are preliminary.

      "First half of 2024: Renewable electricity generation continues to rise significantly  | Umweltbundesamt\nFirst half of 2024: Renewable electricity generation continues to rise significantly \nHeating and transport sectors remain almost unchanged \nCurrent figures from the German Environment Agency (UBA) for the first half of 2024 show that electricity generation from renewable energies increased by nine per cent compared to the same period last year. However, capacity expansion must be further accelerated to meet climate and energy targets. In the heating sector, mild weather led to lower demand for heating. In the mobility sector, the use of renewable electricity in transport increased slightly.\n\"It is a success that the renewable share of electricity continues to grow. At the same time, the growth figures make it clear that considerable efforts are still required. In the photovoltaic sector alone, we need an increase of around 50 per cent in order to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Sources Act,\u201d says Dirk Messner, President of the German Environment Agency. \u201cPlanning reliability and careful further development of the subsidy mechanisms are important for success. In addition, distribution grid areas in which a particularly large number of renewable energy systems are connected should not be burdened further by rising grid fees.\u201d\nRenewables account for around 57 per cent of gross electricity econsumption\u2060 \u00a0 \nApproximately 147 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity were generated from renewable sources, representing an increase of about nine percent compared to the same period in the previous year (135 TWh). Two factors played a decisive role in this. Firstly, windy winter months and the addition of new plants led to a 10 per cent increase in wind power generation. In addition, the large increase in output in the photovoltaic (PV) sector led to an increase of 13 per cent compared to the same period of the previous year, despite the lack of sunshine. In the hydropower sector, rainy \u2060weather\u2060 led to an increase of 12 per cent. Over the entire first half of 2024, wind power generation accounted for the largest share of renewable electricity generation at around 51 per cent. Photovoltaics followed with 24 per cent, electricity generation from\u2060 biomass with around 15 per cent and hydropower with around 8 per cent of renewable electricity. As demand for electricity in the current year was roughly the same as in the previous year, the share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption rose significantly in the first half of 2024. According to calculations by the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat), the share was already around 57 per cent. A projection for the entirety of 2024 is not possible at this stage, as renewable electricity generation depends on weather conditions and the development of electricity consumption throughout the rest of the year. The increase in output in the first half of 2024 was once again heavily dominated by the expansion of PV. \u00a0For example, net additions in the first two quarters totalled 7.5 gigawatts (GW), while the addition of onshore wind energy systems only reached 0.9 GW. Around 0.4 GW of net new capacity was added to the installed capacity of offshore wind energy plants in the second quarter. With total installed capacity exceeding 88 GW, the 2024 expansion target for PV of 84 GW, as set by the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), has been achieved six months ahead of schedule. The installed capacity of onshore wind turbines currently stands at just under 62 GW, which means that the target of 69 GW set by the EEG in 2024 is unlikely to be reached\nDecline in renewable heat production \nTotal heat production from renewable sources amounted to 111 TWh in the first half of 2024. Compared to the first half of 2023, the heat provided from renewable sources fell by seven per cent overall. The main reason for this was warmer weather than in the same period of the previous year, which reduced the overall demand for heat. This decline was mitigated by an increase in the number of heat pumps. As a result of this dynamic growth in heat pumps, particularly as a result of installations in the second half of 2023, around 3.5 per cent more heat was generated from near-surface geothermal energy and environmental heat compared to the same period last year.\nHowever according to the latest reports from industry associations, sales of heat pumps have fallen sharply by around 50 per cent compared to the previous year. In order to achieve the German government\u2019s target of 500,000 installed heat pumps per year, this trend needs to be reversed. Three quarters of renewable heat still comes from biomass, around 6 per cent from biogenic waste and around 4 per cent from solar thermal systems.\nSlight increase in the transport sector \nIn the first half of the year, around 21.9 TWh from renewable sources was used in the transport sector. This is an increase of 3 per cent compared to the first half of 2023. Based on current information, the total amount of biofuels used was at the same level as in the first half of the previous year. In contrast, the use of renewable electricity in the transport sector increased by 16 per cent, as not only did the renewable share in the electricity sector grow, but so did the number of electrically powered vehicles. The amount of renewable electricity used in the transport sector corresponds to just under three per cent of the green electricity used in Germany. Around 70 per cent of this is used in rail transport and today around 30 per cent in road transport.\nFurther information: \nThe Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat) analyses the use of renewable energies on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and\u2060 Climate Action\u2060 (BMWK) and continuously compiles reports on the development of renewable energies on the basis of currently available data. In addition to annual publications, AGEE-Stat also regularly publishes monthly and quarterly reports. In the current quarterly report, you will find further graphics on the current development of renewable energies in 2024. The AGEE-Stat head office is located at the German Environment Agency in Dessau.\nLinks\nPress\nContact\nInternational Spokesman\nPress Officer\nPress Assistants\nHelpful hints about our website?\nHow can we improve our website?\nThe Umweltbundesamt\nFor our environment\nThe UBA\u2019s motto, For our environment (\u201cF\u00fcr Mensch und Umwelt\u201d), sums up our mission pretty well, we feel.

The average temperature for October 2024 was recorded at around 11 degrees Celsius, compared to 11.9 degrees a year before. In the broader context of climate change, average monthly temperatures are indicative of where the national climate is headed and whether attempts to control global warming are successful.\u00a0\nSummer and winter\nAverage summer temperature in Germany fluctuated in recent years, generally between 18 to 19 degrees Celsius. The seasons remain generally warm, and while there may not be as many hot and sunny days as in other parts of Europe, heat waves have occurred. In fact, 2023 saw 11.5 days with a temperature of at least 30 degrees, though this was a decrease compared to the year before. Meanwhile, average winter temperatures also fluctuated, but were higher in recent years, rising over four degrees on average in 2024. Figures remained in the above zero range since 2011. Numbers therefore suggest that German winters are becoming warmer, even if individual regions experiencing colder sub-zero snaps or even more snowfall may disagree.\u00a0\nRain, rain, go away\nAverage monthly precipitation varied depending on the season, though sometimes figures from different times of the year were comparable. In 2024, the average monthly precipitation was highest in May and September, although rainfalls might increase in October and November with the beginning of the cold season. In the past, torrential rains have led to catastrophic flooding in Germany, with one of the most devastating being the flood of July 2021. Germany is not immune to the weather changing between two extremes, e.g. very warm spring months mostly without rain, when rain might be wished for, and then increased precipitation in other months where dry weather might be better, for example during planting and harvest seasons. Climate change remains on the agenda in all its far-reaching ways.\u00a0\n\n                        Average monthly temperature in Germany from October 2023 to October 2024 \n                    \n                            (in Celsius)\n                        \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nOctober 2024\nGermany\nOctober 2023 to October 2024\nFigures for the months preceding October 2024 were retrieved from previous report editions of the German Meteorological Service.According to the source, figures are preliminary.

      "First half of 2024: Renewable electricity generation continues to rise significantly  | Umweltbundesamt\nFirst half of 2024: Renewable electricity generation continues to rise significantly \nHeating and transport sectors remain almost unchanged \nCurrent figures from the German Environment Agency (UBA) for the first half of 2024 show that electricity generation from renewable energies increased by nine per cent compared to the same period last year. However, capacity expansion must be further accelerated to meet climate and energy targets. In the heating sector, mild weather led to lower demand for heating. In the mobility sector, the use of renewable electricity in transport increased slightly.\n\"It is a success that the renewable share of electricity continues to grow. At the same time, the growth figures make it clear that considerable efforts are still required. In the photovoltaic sector alone, we need an increase of around 50 per cent in order to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Sources Act,\u201d says Dirk Messner, President of the German Environment Agency. \u201cPlanning reliability and careful further development of the subsidy mechanisms are important for success. In addition, distribution grid areas in which a particularly large number of renewable energy systems are connected should not be burdened further by rising grid fees.\u201d\nRenewables account for around 57 per cent of gross electricity econsumption\u2060 \u00a0 \nApproximately 147 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity were generated from renewable sources, representing an increase of about nine percent compared to the same period in the previous year (135 TWh). Two factors played a decisive role in this. Firstly, windy winter months and the addition of new plants led to a 10 per cent increase in wind power generation. In addition, the large increase in output in the photovoltaic (PV) sector led to an increase of 13 per cent compared to the same period of the previous year, despite the lack of sunshine. In the hydropower sector, rainy \u2060weather\u2060 led to an increase of 12 per cent. Over the entire first half of 2024, wind power generation accounted for the largest share of renewable electricity generation at around 51 per cent. Photovoltaics followed with 24 per cent, electricity generation from\u2060 biomass with around 15 per cent and hydropower with around 8 per cent of renewable electricity. As demand for electricity in the current year was roughly the same as in the previous year, the share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption rose significantly in the first half of 2024. According to calculations by the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat), the share was already around 57 per cent. A projection for the entirety of 2024 is not possible at this stage, as renewable electricity generation depends on weather conditions and the development of electricity consumption throughout the rest of the year. The increase in output in the first half of 2024 was once again heavily dominated by the expansion of PV. \u00a0For example, net additions in the first two quarters totalled 7.5 gigawatts (GW), while the addition of onshore wind energy systems only reached 0.9 GW. Around 0.4 GW of net new capacity was added to the installed capacity of offshore wind energy plants in the second quarter. With total installed capacity exceeding 88 GW, the 2024 expansion target for PV of 84 GW, as set by the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), has been achieved six months ahead of schedule. The installed capacity of onshore wind turbines currently stands at just under 62 GW, which means that the target of 69 GW set by the EEG in 2024 is unlikely to be reached\nDecline in renewable heat production \nTotal heat production from renewable sources amounted to 111 TWh in the first half of 2024. Compared to the first half of 2023, the heat provided from renewable sources fell by seven per cent overall. The main reason for this was warmer weather than in the same period of the previous year, which reduced the overall demand for heat. This decline was mitigated by an increase in the number of heat pumps. As a result of this dynamic growth in heat pumps, particularly as a result of installations in the second half of 2023, around 3.5 per cent more heat was generated from near-surface geothermal energy and environmental heat compared to the same period last year.\nHowever according to the latest reports from industry associations, sales of heat pumps have fallen sharply by around 50 per cent compared to the previous year. In order to achieve the German government\u2019s target of 500,000 installed heat pumps per year, this trend needs to be reversed. Three quarters of renewable heat still comes from biomass, around 6 per cent from biogenic waste and around 4 per cent from solar thermal systems.\nSlight increase in the transport sector \nIn the first half of the year, around 21.9 TWh from renewable sources was used in the transport sector. This is an increase of 3 per cent compared to the first half of 2023. Based on current information, the total amount of biofuels used was at the same level as in the first half of the previous year. In contrast, the use of renewable electricity in the transport sector increased by 16 per cent, as not only did the renewable share in the electricity sector grow, but so did the number of electrically powered vehicles. The amount of renewable electricity used in the transport sector corresponds to just under three per cent of the green electricity used in Germany. Around 70 per cent of this is used in rail transport and today around 30 per cent in road transport.\nFurther information: \nThe Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat) analyses the use of renewable energies on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and\u2060 Climate Action\u2060 (BMWK) and continuously compiles reports on the development of renewable energies on the basis of currently available data. In addition to annual publications, AGEE-Stat also regularly publishes monthly and quarterly reports. In the current quarterly report, you will find further graphics on the current development of renewable energies in 2024. The AGEE-Stat head office is located at the German Environment Agency in Dessau.\nLinks\nPress\nContact\nInternational Spokesman\nPress Officer\nPress Assistants\nHelpful hints about our website?\nHow can we improve our website?\nThe Umweltbundesamt\nFor our environment\nThe UBA\u2019s motto, For our environment (\u201cF\u00fcr Mensch und Umwelt\u201d), sums up our mission pretty well, we feel.

      "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of March 2024 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $16.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 593 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $11.1 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $995 million has been announced for clean water and water infrastructure. Florida received $2.1 billion to connect everyone in the state to reliable high-speed internet and, as of today, more than 1,708,000 Florida households are already saving on their monthly internet bill due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve the lives of Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $8.5 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $7.7 billion in highway formula funding and $158 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges to date. o $117.1 million through the RAISE program to date. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $207 million through the INFRA program to date. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet over 272,962 homes and small businesses in Florida do not have access to high-speed internet infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to everyone in America. The Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to extend this program through 2024. Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will lose their internet connection and the economic opportunities that come with it. See ACP enrollment for every state and territory here. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received $2.1 billion for high-speed internet. Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide access to high-speed internet to everyone in Florida. Florida also received $2.8 million in funding to expand middle-mile infrastructure in the state. In addition, about 1,708,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in water infrastructure in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $995 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $995 million available to date to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $229.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation and 19% of transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $1.3 billion to improve public transportation options across the state. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Announced funding to date will double the number of clean transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Schools in Florida have been awarded $45 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. Communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $113.7 million has been announced in Florida to date to build out a network of EV chargers in the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy about $150 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $392.4 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power. This includes: o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; o $162.8 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received approximately $1 billion for airports. Ports and Waterways: Our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received roughly $128.3 million for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $24.9 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience, including $51.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $123 million has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites. Approximately $25 million has been allocated to Florida for capping orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June\u2013August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8\u00b0F, 2.5\u00b0F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.The January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\u00a0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\u00a0\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

      "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of March 2024 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $16.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 593 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $11.1 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $995 million has been announced for clean water and water infrastructure. Florida received $2.1 billion to connect everyone in the state to reliable high-speed internet and, as of today, more than 1,708,000 Florida households are already saving on their monthly internet bill due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve the lives of Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $8.5 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $7.7 billion in highway formula funding and $158 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges to date. o $117.1 million through the RAISE program to date. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $207 million through the INFRA program to date. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet over 272,962 homes and small businesses in Florida do not have access to high-speed internet infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to everyone in America. The Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to extend this program through 2024. Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will lose their internet connection and the economic opportunities that come with it. See ACP enrollment for every state and territory here. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received $2.1 billion for high-speed internet. Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide access to high-speed internet to everyone in Florida. Florida also received $2.8 million in funding to expand middle-mile infrastructure in the state. In addition, about 1,708,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in water infrastructure in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $995 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $995 million available to date to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $229.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation and 19% of transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $1.3 billion to improve public transportation options across the state. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Announced funding to date will double the number of clean transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Schools in Florida have been awarded $45 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. Communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $113.7 million has been announced in Florida to date to build out a network of EV chargers in the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy about $150 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $392.4 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power. This includes: o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; o $162.8 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received approximately $1 billion for airports. Ports and Waterways: Our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received roughly $128.3 million for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $24.9 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience, including $51.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $123 million has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June\u2013August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8\u00b0F, 2.5\u00b0F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.The January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\u00a0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\u00a0\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June\u2013August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8\u00b0F, 2.5\u00b0F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.The January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\u00a0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\u00a0\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

      "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of July 2023 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $10.5 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 359 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $6.9 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $800 million has been announced for clean water. As of today, more than 1,389,000 households across the state are receiving affordable high-speed internet due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve lives for Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $5.4 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $5.1 billion in highway formula funding and $105.3 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges in 2022 and 2023. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $117.1 million through the RAISE program and $27 million through the INFRA program in 2022 and 2023. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet nearly 22% of Floridians do not have an internet subscription. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to every American. Additionally, experts estimate that as many as 3,283,000 households in Florida are eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which cuts internet bills by up to $30 per month, or $75 for households on Tribal lands, and provides a one-time $100 discount off a connected device. The Biden-Harris Administration is providing further cost savings by working with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. \u25cf Progress to date: To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. In addition, about 1,389,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, with more signing up every day. Households can check their eligibility, sign up, and find fully covered internet plans at GetInternet.gov. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $800 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $800 million available in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $146.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 more likely to commute via public transportation and 20% transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has been allocated $529.4 million to improve public transportation options across the state in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This year alone, funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help double the number of clean public transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, schools in Florida have been awarded $11.8 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. In addition, communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $71.5 million in 2022 and 2023 to build out a network of EV chargers across the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy more than $70 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $168.5 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power in 2022 and 2023. This includes: Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; and o $31.5 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Additional grid funding will be made available in the coming months. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received approximately $658.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for airports. Ports and Waterways: Like airports, our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received roughly $143.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $43.2 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $1.4 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience in 2022 and 2023 including $32.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $120.4 million has been allocated to cleaning up brownfield sites in Florida.

Middle Mile Project Spotlight WANRack-mm-FL2 The Department of Commerce awarded $2.8 million to WANRack to build 44.8 miles of open access middle mile infrastructure from north of Lakeland, FL going through Pasco and Zephyrhills/Dade City and then continuing north on Route 98 into Hernando County. The Middle Mile Grant Program plays a critical role in providing quality, affordable high-speed Internet and connecting unserved regions to the Internet backbone. See here for more information about Enabling Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure Program award recipients. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Brownfields Cleanup Project Spotlight South Florida Regional Planning Council The Environmental Protection Agency awarded the South Florida Regional Planning Council $1 million to accelerate cleanup efforts at contaminated sites in Central Miami. Until 1985, Central Miami was physically separated from the predominantly white area east of 12th Avenue by an 8-foot-high concrete wall, and was nearly destroyed by a fire after riots broke out in 1979. Priority sites in Central Miami include the 2-acre former Orkin Site, the 20-acre Poinciana Industrial Center assemblage property, and the 4.3-acre Northside Transit-Oriented Development property. See here for a full list of Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) recipients. PHMSA Project Spotlight City of Milton Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization Grant The Department of Transportation awarded $10 million to the City of Milton to replace 4.38 miles of cast iron natural gas lines and 7.91 miles of steel gas mains. The project will help improve public safety, protect public health, and reduce methane emissions from natural gas distribution pipes in underserved communities. See here for more information on Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) projects. Roads and Bridges Project Spotlight I-4 West Central Florida Truck Parking Facility The $15 million grant from the Department of Transportation will help build a new truck parking facility with about 120 spaces, electric charging stations, and pedestrian infrastructure to access nearby amenities. This corridor between Tampa and Orlando carries an average of 18,000 trucks daily, but currently lacks sufficient parking. The facility will be connected to Florida\u2019s Department of Transportation Truck Parking Availability System in order to help drivers identify available parking locations more quickly. By providing reliable parking capacity, the project improves safety for tired drivers and makes supply chain movement more efficient. See here for more information on awarded grants through the INFRA program. Superfund Cleanup Project Spotlight Southern Solvents, Inc. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 The Environmental Protection Agency has announced $5 million in funding for the cleanup at the Southern Solvents, Inc. site. The funds will be used to remove and treat tetrachloroethylene (also known as PCE or PERC) and trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination in the soil and groundwater. This funding will allow EPA to restore and protect a valuable drinking water resource in the Tampa, Florida area. The cleanup will restore the site and prevent the contaminants from migrating to other areas. See here for more information on EPA Superfund cleanup work. SMART Project Spotlight A MicroFreight Approach for Safer Streets The Department of Transportation has awarded over $1.9 million to the Miami-Dade County to introduce a platform of integrated data sensors, and digital infrastructures systems to enable and scale safe, zero-emission last-mile freight and goods deliveries in Miami-Dade County.

      "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of July 2023 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $10.5 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 359 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $6.9 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $800 million has been announced for clean water. As of today, more than 1,389,000 households across the state are receiving affordable high-speed internet due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve lives for Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $5.4 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $5.1 billion in highway formula funding and $105.3 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges in 2022 and 2023. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $117.1 million through the RAISE program and $27 million through the INFRA program in 2022 and 2023. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet nearly 22% of Floridians do not have an internet subscription. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to every American. Additionally, experts estimate that as many as 3,283,000 households in Florida are eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which cuts internet bills by up to $30 per month, or $75 for households on Tribal lands, and provides a one-time $100 discount off a connected device. The Biden-Harris Administration is providing further cost savings by working with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. \u25cf Progress to date: To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. In addition, about 1,389,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, with more signing up every day.

Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $800 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $800 million available in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $146.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 more likely to commute via public transportation and 20% transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has been allocated $529.4 million to improve public transportation options across the state in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This year alone, funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help double the number of clean public transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, schools in Florida have been awarded $11.8 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. In addition, communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $71.5 million in 2022 and 2023 to build out a network of EV chargers across the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy more than $70 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $168.5 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power in 2022 and 2023. This includes: Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; and o $31.5 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Additional grid funding will be made available in the coming months. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received approximately $658.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for airports. Ports and Waterways: Like airports, our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received roughly $143.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $43.2 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $1.4 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience in 2022 and 2023 including $32.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $120.4 million has been allocated to cleaning up brownfield sites in Florida.

Florida Project Spotlights Low- and No-Emission Project Spotlight City Of Tallahassee The Department of Transportation awarded $20.3 million to the City of Tallahassee's StarMetro system to buy battery-electric buses and support charging infrastructure. This funding will also develop a workforce training program for the city's mechanics and operators to maintain the fleet. The project will help reduce emissions and improve service and reliability for riders in and around Tallahassee. See here for a full list of FY23 Bus and Low- and No-Emission Grant projects. Middle Mile Project Spotlight WANRack-mm-FL2 The Department of Commerce awarded $2.8 million to WANRack to build 44.8 miles of open access middle mile infrastructure from north of Lakeland, FL going through Pasco and Zephyrhills/Dade City and then continuing north on Route 98 into Hernando County. The Middle Mile Grant Program plays a critical role in providing quality, affordable high-speed Internet and connecting unserved regions to the Internet backbone. See here for more information about Enabling Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure Program award recipients. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Brownfields Cleanup Project Spotlight South Florida Regional Planning Council The Environmental Protection Agency awarded the South Florida Regional Planning Council $1 million to accelerate cleanup efforts at contaminated sites in Central Miami. Until 1985, Central Miami was physically separated from the predominantly white area east of 12th Avenue by an 8-foot-high concrete wall, and was nearly destroyed by a fire after riots broke out in 1979. Priority sites in Central Miami include the 2-acre former Orkin Site, the 20-acre Poinciana Industrial Center assemblage property, and the 4.3-acre Northside Transit-Oriented Development property. See here for a full list of Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) recipients. PHMSA Project Spotlight City of Milton Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization Grant The Department of Transportation awarded $10 million to the City of Milton to replace 4.38 miles of cast iron natural gas lines and 7.91 miles of steel gas mains. The project will help improve public safety, protect public health, and reduce methane emissions from natural gas distribution pipes in underserved communities. See here for more information on Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) projects. Roads and Bridges Project Spotlight I-4 West Central Florida Truck Parking Facility The $15 million grant from the Department of Transportation will help build a new truck parking facility with about 120 spaces, electric charging stations, and pedestrian infrastructure to access nearby amenities. This corridor between Tampa and Orlando carries an average of 18,000 trucks daily, but currently lacks sufficient parking. The facility will be connected to Florida\u2019s Department of Transportation Truck Parking Availability System in order to help drivers identify available parking locations more quickly. By providing reliable parking capacity, the project improves safety for tired drivers and makes supply chain movement more efficient. See here for more information on awarded grants through the INFRA program. Superfund Cleanup Project Spotlight Southern Solvents, Inc. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 The Environmental Protection Agency has announced $5 million in funding for the cleanup at the Southern Solvents, Inc. site. The funds will be used to remove and treat tetrachloroethylene (also known as PCE or PERC) and trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination in the soil and groundwater. This funding will allow EPA to restore and protect a valuable drinking water resource in the Tampa, Florida area. The cleanup will restore the site and prevent the contaminants from migrating to other areas. See here for more information on EPA Superfund cleanup work. SMART Project Spotlight A MicroFreight Approach for Safer Streets The Department of Transportation has awarded over $1.9 million to the Miami-Dade County to introduce a platform of integrated data sensors, and digital infrastructures systems to enable and scale safe, zero-emission last-mile freight and goods deliveries in Miami-Dade County. See here for more information on the Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation (SMART) Grants Program. Reconnecting Communities Project Spotlight Uniting Neighborhoods and Infrastructure for Transportation Equity: Ashley Drive The City of Tampa will receive a $5.3 million Capital grant from the Department of Transportation to reconnect the Downtown Tampa area and its riverfront. The project will lower the current interchange ramp to street level, increasing mobility through new bicycle and pedestrian routes. The area will be safer and more accessible with new installation of new signals and improved active transportation facilities. See here for a full list of announced Reconnecting Communities Awards.",

Bastick, director (and Excel MVP) with SumProduct Pty Ltd, highlights some of the common issues and scenarios in financial modelling / Excel spreadsheeting.\u00a0 This time he looks at how to create formulae which consider historical, actual and forecast data simultaneously.\nMany accountants and analysts have to analyse trends using past and current performance in order to create informed forecasts for the future. \u00a0This requires three distinct datasets:\n\nHistorical information: data that has now been gathered that actually happened.\u00a0 This is often recorded in Management Information Systems, general ledgers, tax returns, etc.\u00a0 This data tends to have one thing in common: it\u2019s a matter of fact\nActual data: whilst historical information summarises past data that has been locked down, \u201cactuals\u201d may be slightly more fluid in that data may be available for the first nine months of the year (say) combined with three months\u2019 projections, based upon predicted orders, work schedules, hours of operation and so on\nForecast projections: these numbers are usually based upon calculations and correlations with the historical / actual data.\u00a0 The first two datasets may be distinct and independent, but typically, there is a relationship with at least one of the other types and forecast projections.\n\nYou may or may not agree with my above summation.\u00a0 That\u2019s not really the point here.\u00a0 They key takeaway here is that when we undertake financial modelling, we often have more than one situation that occurs over the time periods, e.g.\n\nThe problem with data set out like this is two-fold:\n\nLess experienced modellers will use three types of data entry for the three segments, which may be a combination of formulae and / or hard code.\u00a0 The concern is someone else will come along and copy one formula across the entire row which will not be appropriate for the other data categories\nMore experienced modellers acknowledge one consistent formula must be used across the row \u2013 but then try and do all calculations in the one cell and construct a formula that typically starts \\=IF(IF(\u2026 etc.\n\nNeither is optimal, but the second option is nearer the truth.\u00a0 The problem with \\=IF(IF(\u2026 is it intimidates end users who try to follow it, with a succession of nested calculations.\u00a0 Excel 2016\u2019s IFS function is even worse as people have to understand both the concept of nesting and the prevailing syntax. \u00a0Stepping out seems way simpler.\nI am going to take start with an example with three scenarios:\n\nHistorical: in my example, these will be inputs, but they could link to another file (say)\nActual: in my example, again, these will be inputs, but this could be a calculation based on actual data for the period to date and then extrapolated (say)\nForecast: in my example, this will be a formula.\n\nYou could have five situations, two linked, one hard coded and two formulaic \u2013 the idea would remain the same.\u00a0 The first thing is to collate all necessary inputs:\n\nMy plan here is to use the first row of data for historical periods, the second row for the actual period, and then use the growth rate on the previous period for forecasts.\u00a0 Clearly, only one value would be used in each year (column).\nNext, I created a selector for which year was the actual year:\n\nThe input cell (Actual, in yellow) drives the other two dates, as Historical would have to be all periods up to the year before and Forecast from the following year.\u00a0 With more situations, there would have to be more inputs, but the general idea would remain similar.\nI can now create a \u201cflag\u201d system (1 for on / yes, 0 for off / no) to denote which situation relates to which period:\n\nThe Historical flags (row 37 of the image above) are 1 for years 2015, 2016 and 2017 using the formula\n\\=(G$36<\\=$G25)*1\nin cell G37, for example.\u00a0 This checks that the years in question is less than the value in cell G25, which is 2017.\u00a0 Similarly, the Actual formula is\n\\=(G$36=$G26)*1\nand the Forecast formula is\n\\=(G$36>\\=$G27)*1\nwhich means all formulae are simple.\nA check has been put in row 41 to ensure there is a \u20181\u2019 (but only one \u20181\u2019) in each column (year) too:\n\\=(SUM(G37:G39)<>1)*1\nFinally, the Choice (row 43) uses the MATCH function (see >Are Things LOOKing Up for INDEX and MATCH?\u00a0for more information) to determine where the 1 in each column is, i.e. 1 if it is in the first row, 2 if it is in the second, etc.\n\\=MATCH(1,G$37:G$39,0)\nMATCH(lookup_value,lookup_array,[match_type]) returns the relative position of an item in an array that (approximately) matches a specified value.\u00a0 It is not case sensitive.\nThe third argument, match_type, does not have to be entered, but for most situations, I strongly recommend that it is specified.\u00a0 It allows one of three values:\n\nmatch_type 1 [default if omitted]: finds the largest value less than or equal to the lookup_value \u2013 but the lookup_array must be in strict ascending order, limiting flexibility;\nmatch_type 0: probably the most useful setting, MATCH will find the position of the first value that matches lookup_value exactly.\u00a0 The lookup_array can have data in any order and even allows duplicates; and\nmatch type -1: finds the smallest value greater than or equal to the lookup_value \u2013 but the lookup_array must be in strict descending order, again limiting flexibility.\n\nWhen using MATCH, if there is no (approximate) match, #N/A is returned (this may also occur if data is not correctly sorted depending upon match_type).\nFor example:\n\nIn the figure above, MATCH(\u201cd\u201d,F12:F22,0) gives a value of 6, being the relative position of the first \u2018d\u2019 in the range.\u00a0 Note that having match_type 0 here is important.\u00a0 The data contains duplicates and is not sorted alphanumerically.\u00a0 Consequently, match_types 1 and -1 would give the wrong answer: 7 and #N/A respectively.\nReturning to the 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s section (the latter displayed as dashes in the graphic), these values have also been used to drive conditional formatting in the original input section too, viz.\n\nTo create grey cells, I have simply highlighted the entire range and use conditional formatting (in the \u2018Styles\u2019 section of the \u2018Home\u2019 tab of the Ribbon, ALT + O + D) as follows:\n\nWe are pretty much done now.\u00a0 All that is needed is a formula for the output:\n\nThe formula\n\\=CHOOSE(G$43,G$13,G$14,F53*(1+G$15))\nin cell G53 uses the value in row 13 if the choice is 1 (historical selected), in row 14 if the choice is 2 (actual) and multiplies the previous period by 1 plus the growth rate in row 15 if the choice is 3 (forecast) using the CHOOSE function.\nThe CHOOSE function employs the following syntax to operate:\nCHOOSE(index_number, value1, [value2])\nAs a reminder, the CHOOSE function has the following arguments:\n\nindex_number: this is required and is used to specify which value argument is to be selected. \u00a0The index_number must be a number between 1 and 254, or a formula or reference to a cell containing a number between 1 and 254.\nif index_number is 1, CHOOSE returns value1; if it is 2, CHOOSE returns value2; and so on\nif index_number is less than 1 or greater than the number of the last value in the list, CHOOSE returns the #VALUE! error value\nif index_number is a fraction, it is truncated to the lowest integer before being used.\n\n\nvalue1, value2, ...: value 1 is required, but subsequent values are optional. \u00a0There may be between 1 and 254 value arguments from which CHOOSE selects a value or an action to perform based on index_number. \u00a0The arguments can be numbers, cell references, defined names, formulas, functions, or text.\n\nYou can find out more about CHOOSE at Do You Choose to Use CHOOSE?.\nThe great thing about this method is regardless of whether end users know about conditional formatting, INDEX or CHOOSE, the actual final calculation is easy to follow on paper, viz.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what financial modelling is all about!

Projections indicate that millions, perhaps 1/7 of the population, might face displacement as per the World Bank's estimations,\" Saber H Chowdhury, minister for environment, forest and climate change, was quoted as saying in the report.\nSea level rise is projected to lead to a 6-9 percent decline in the country's rice production. Increasingly saline waters are also projected to disrupt fisheries, which will disproportionately affect poor coastal communities, for whom fish is an important source of protein.\nSaline water can also infiltrate groundwater and surface water sources, affecting drinking water supplies and human health.\n\"Sea level around South Asia will continue to rise over the 21st century, increasing flooding in low-lying Bangladesh. This will devastate vital food crops, forcing more people to leave their homes,\" says professor AKM Saiful Islam, director of the Institute of Water and Flood Management (IWFM) of Buet and a lead author of the report.\nThe accelerating impacts of climate change in Bangladesh highlights an urgent need to scale up international action against climate change.\nBangladesh repeatedly experiences extreme climate events like heatwaves and tropical cyclones, the report adds.\nIn 2019 and 2000, the country experienced 185 extreme weather events, making it the seventh most vulnerable to climate change in the world.\nGovernment adaptation policy and local initiatives have saved many lives and, so far, averted the worst impacts of climate change, the report says.\nBangladesh is recognised as a global leader in adaptation and resilience. In 2005, Bangladesh was one of the first least developed countries to develop a national adaptation programme of action.\nBy the end of the century, even under a very low emissions scenario, Bangladesh could see a further 0.8\u00b0C of warming compared with 1981\u20132010, and heavier rainfall could increase peak river flow by 16 percent relative to 1971\u20132000.\nIn the last few decades, the number of people who have died during cyclones has fallen from six digits (300,000+ from Cyclone Bhola in 1970) to double digits (35 from Cyclone Sitrang in 2022), largely due to the success of the country's Cyclone Preparedness Programme.\nIn the last few decades, the government has invested in saline-tolerant rice varieties, floating agriculture in regions that suffer flooding, and water-saving technologies in drought-prone areas to help safeguard food security in the face of increasingly extreme weather.\nRelated News\n\nGlobal loss and damage initiative launched in Dhaka \n\nA window of opportunity to phase out fossil fuels \n\nSea-level rise in Bangladesh: Faster than global average  \n\nWhat will happen when the 'Doomsday Glacier' disintegrates? \n\nClimate loss and damage are clearly visible in southwest Bangladesh \n\u2018\u09af\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09cd\u09b2\u09ac\u09c7\u09b0 \u0995\u09a5\u09be \u09ac\u09b2\u099b\u09c7\u09a8, \u09a4\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0989\u099a\u09bf\u09ce \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09cd\u09b2\u09ac\u09c0 \u09a6\u09b2 \u09a4\u09c8\u09b0\u09bf \u0995\u09b0\u09be\u2019\n\u2018\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09bf\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u099a\u09a8 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be \u098f\u09ae\u09a8 \u0995\u09cb\u09a8\u09cb \u09b6\u0999\u09cd\u0995\u09be \u09a8\u09c7\u0987, \u0985\u09a8\u09c7\u0995 \u09ac\u09bf\u09b2\u09ae\u09cd\u09ac\u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09ac\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be\u2019\n\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09c0 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c7\u09df\u09be\u09a6 \u09b8\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09cb\u099a\u09cd\u099a \u09ea \u09ac\u099b\u09b0 \u09b9\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be \u09a4\u09be\u09b0\u0993 \u0995\u09ae: \u0986\u09b2\u099c\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u09b0\u09be\u0995\u09c7 \u09a1. \u0987\u0989\u09a8\u09c2\u09b8\n",
      "\nAccessibility links\nFrom bridges and ports to a new regional hub\nBangladesh\u2019s evolving infrastructure\nSouth Asia\u2019s \"Land of Rivers\" has long faced infrastructure challenges, but from tunnels and bridges to a new deep-sea port, engineering is transforming Bangladesh.\nKnown as the \u201cLand of Rivers\u201d, Bangladesh owes its distinctive tasselled coastline to the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the world\u2019s largest river delta. A vast network of lakes and waterways criss-crosses the country\u2019s flat, low-lying terrain, meaning that most intercity journeys require negotiating one or more rivers. Couple the riverine landscape with risks including earthquakes and climate change, and it\u2019s easy to see how infrastructure bottlenecks have long inhibited Bangladesh\u2019s development.\nBut a new wave of investment is beginning to help overcome these issues. Bangladesh\u2019s longest bridge, the record-breaking Padma Bridge, extends for more than 6km (4 miles) across the turbulent Padma River. A four-lane highway and single-track railway connect 21 districts in southwest Bangladesh with the capital Dhaka, meaning\u00a0cargos of fresh produce that would sometimes rot while\u00a0in long ferry queues can reach their destination faster.\n\nThe nation\u2019s first road tunnel, Bangabandhu Tunnel, runs for more than 3km (2 miles) under the Karnaphuli river, uniting Chattogram port with Anwara opposite, and connecting two major economic corridors \u2013 the Dhaka-Chattogram and Chattogram-Cox\u2019s Bazar highways. It will also strengthen the Asian Highway Network, a road system spanning 32 countries.\nExpanding ports, expanding exports\nPorts are essential to Bangladesh\u2019s trade, but the two riverside seaports it inherited at independence, Chattogram and Mongla, are too shallow and lack the container handling capacity to keep up with the growth of trade and the ever-increasing scale of container ships.\nAs of 2020, Bangladesh\u2019s ports handled about 6,500 billion taka ($60 billion) in exports, with ship arrivals increasing at the rate of 11% per year. A dredging programme means the Payra seaport can now handle ships with a draft of up to 10.5m (35ft), which could be as long as 225m (740ft) and as wide as 30m (100ft). That said, many container ships still have to dock in India or Sri Lanka and collect or unload goods from Bangladesh using lighter vessels. This significantly adds to the cost of doing business, as well as slowing turnaround times due to the shortage of lighters.\n\nScheduled for completion at the end of 2026, the new Matarbari deep-sea port is set to transform Bangladesh\u2019s maritime infrastructure. It will be 18m (60ft) deep, with four container berths, plus room for further expansion.\n\u201cWe expect the port will handle around 10 million tons of cargo annually in the initial phase, increasing to 40 million tons in the long term,\u201d explains project director Mohammed Zafar Alam. \u201cThis will significantly reduce transportation costs and increase trade efficiency for Bangladesh.\u201d\nAlam estimates the port could increase Bangladesh\u2019s GDP by more than 1%, alongside decreasing import costs by 15% and export costs by 10%. For larger container ships, he expects to see 35 to 62 ships visit a year, potentially increasing to as many as 250.\nDeveloping the electric vehicle sector\nElectric vehicles (EVs) face specific reputational challenges in Bangladesh. On the streets of Dhaka, home-made electric rickshaws are a danger to life and limb: bicycle frames and, perhaps most importantly, brakes are not designed to sustain the speeds batteries deliver.\nBut the nation\u2019s improved road and bridge infrastructure is setting the scene for a new wave of EVs, which are more sustainable than the fossil-fuel vehicles that contribute about 15% of Dhaka\u2019s air pollution. The country\u2019s first EV manufacturing plant is under development in Chattogram.\n\u201cWell-maintained roads and bridges reduce travel times, increase accessibility and instil confidence among consumers regarding the reliability of EVs for long-distance travel,\u201d explains Hafizur Rahman Khan, chairman of Bangladesh\u2019s Runner Automobiles Plc. \u201cThis improved infrastructure also addresses concerns regarding range anxiety, a common barrier to EV adoption, by offering a network of routes with convenient charging facilities along the way.\u201d\n\nRunner Automobiles manufactures two- and three-wheeled fossil fuel-powered vehicles but has begun distributing electric two-wheelers and has a joint venture distributing electric cars. \u201cBangladesh's expanding middle-income demographic, experiencing increased affluence, is increasingly inclined towards personal transportation solutions,\u201d Khan notes. \u201cThis growing consumer base seeks convenient and cost-effective mobility options.\u201d\nWith Bangladesh on track to graduate from the UN\u2019s Least Developed Countries list in 2026, new infrastructure is helping open up the country\u2019s domestic and international trade. With 150 bridges opened on a single day in October 2023, it\u2019s possible the \u201cLand of Rivers\u201d could one day become the \u201cLand of Bridges\u201d.\n\nRise of the Bengal Tiger\nBangladesh invites businesses to be a part of its inspiring journey towards a prosperous future. Now, it\u2019s your time to invest in the mission of Smart Bangladesh.\nExplore the BBC\n"

      "\nAccessibility links\nFrom bridges and ports to a new regional hub\nBangladesh\u2019s evolving infrastructure\nSouth Asia\u2019s \"Land of Rivers\" has long faced infrastructure challenges, but from tunnels and bridges to a new deep-sea port, engineering is transforming Bangladesh.\nKnown as the \u201cLand of Rivers\u201d, Bangladesh owes its distinctive tasselled coastline to the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the world\u2019s largest river delta. A vast network of lakes and waterways criss-crosses the country\u2019s flat, low-lying terrain, meaning that most intercity journeys require negotiating one or more rivers. Couple the riverine landscape with risks including earthquakes and climate change, and it\u2019s easy to see how infrastructure bottlenecks have long inhibited Bangladesh\u2019s development.\nBut a new wave of investment is beginning to help overcome these issues. Bangladesh\u2019s longest bridge, the record-breaking Padma Bridge, extends for more than 6km (4 miles) across the turbulent Padma River. A four-lane highway and single-track railway connect 21 districts in southwest Bangladesh with the capital Dhaka, meaning\u00a0cargos of fresh produce that would sometimes rot while\u00a0in long ferry queues can reach their destination faster.\n\nThe nation\u2019s first road tunnel, Bangabandhu Tunnel, runs for more than 3km (2 miles) under the Karnaphuli river, uniting Chattogram port with Anwara opposite, and connecting two major economic corridors \u2013 the Dhaka-Chattogram and Chattogram-Cox\u2019s Bazar highways. It will also strengthen the Asian Highway Network, a road system spanning 32 countries.\nExpanding ports, expanding exports\nPorts are essential to Bangladesh\u2019s trade, but the two riverside seaports it inherited at independence, Chattogram and Mongla, are too shallow and lack the container handling capacity to keep up with the growth of trade and the ever-increasing scale of container ships.\nAs of 2020, Bangladesh\u2019s ports handled about 6,500 billion taka ($60 billion) in exports, with ship arrivals increasing at the rate of 11% per year. A dredging programme means the Payra seaport can now handle ships with a draft of up to 10.5m (35ft), which could be as long as 225m (740ft) and as wide as 30m (100ft). That said, many container ships still have to dock in India or Sri Lanka and collect or unload goods from Bangladesh using lighter vessels. This significantly adds to the cost of doing business, as well as slowing turnaround times due to the shortage of lighters.\n\nScheduled for completion at the end of 2026, the new Matarbari deep-sea port is set to transform Bangladesh\u2019s maritime infrastructure. It will be 18m (60ft) deep, with four container berths, plus room for further expansion.\n\u201cWe expect the port will handle around 10 million tons of cargo annually in the initial phase, increasing to 40 million tons in the long term,\u201d explains project director Mohammed Zafar Alam. \u201cThis will significantly reduce transportation costs and increase trade efficiency for Bangladesh.\u201d\nAlam estimates the port could increase Bangladesh\u2019s GDP by more than 1%, alongside decreasing import costs by 15% and export costs by 10%. For larger container ships, he expects to see 35 to 62 ships visit a year, potentially increasing to as many as 250.\nDeveloping the electric vehicle sector\nElectric vehicles (EVs) face specific reputational challenges in Bangladesh. On the streets of Dhaka, home-made electric rickshaws are a danger to life and limb: bicycle frames and, perhaps most importantly, brakes are not designed to sustain the speeds batteries deliver.\nBut the nation\u2019s improved road and bridge infrastructure is setting the scene for a new wave of EVs, which are more sustainable than the fossil-fuel vehicles that contribute about 15% of Dhaka\u2019s air pollution. The country\u2019s first EV manufacturing plant is under development in Chattogram.\n\u201cWell-maintained roads and bridges reduce travel times, increase accessibility and instil confidence among consumers regarding the reliability of EVs for long-distance travel,\u201d explains Hafizur Rahman Khan, chairman of Bangladesh\u2019s Runner Automobiles Plc. \u201cThis improved infrastructure also addresses concerns regarding range anxiety, a common barrier to EV adoption, by offering a network of routes with convenient charging facilities along the way.\u201d\n\nRunner Automobiles manufactures two- and three-wheeled fossil fuel-powered vehicles but has begun distributing electric two-wheelers and has a joint venture distributing electric cars. \u201cBangladesh's expanding middle-income demographic, experiencing increased affluence, is increasingly inclined towards personal transportation solutions,\u201d Khan notes. \u201cThis growing consumer base seeks convenient and cost-effective mobility options.\u201d\nWith Bangladesh on track to graduate from the UN\u2019s Least Developed Countries list in 2026, new infrastructure is helping open up the country\u2019s domestic and international trade. With 150 bridges opened on a single day in October 2023, it\u2019s possible the \u201cLand of Rivers\u201d could one day become the \u201cLand of Bridges\u201d.\n\nRise of the Bengal Tiger\nBangladesh invites businesses to be a part of its inspiring journey towards a prosperous future. Now, it\u2019s your time to invest in the mission of Smart Bangladesh.\nExplore the BBC\n",

Here we model a range of sea-level rise scenarios to assess the responses of water tables across the diverse topography and climates of the California coast. With 1\u2009m of sea-level rise, areas flooded from below are predicted to expand ~50\u2013130\u2009m inland, and low-lying coastal communities such as those around San Francisco Bay are most at risk. Coastal topography is a controlling factor; long-term rising water tables will intercept low-elevation drainage features, allowing for groundwater discharge that damps the extent of shoaling in ~70% (68.9\u201382.2%) of California\u2019s coastal water tables. Ignoring these topography-limited responses increases flooded-area forecasts by ~20% and substantially underestimates saltwater intrusion. All scenarios estimate that areas with shallow coastal water tables will shrink as they are inundated by overland flooding or are topographically limited from rising inland.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\n\n        Access Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n      \n\n        Get Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n      \n\n$29.99 /\u00a030\u00a0days\n\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA global analysis of subsidence, relative sea-level change and coastal flood exposure\n                                        \n\n\nThe coastal transition zone is an underexplored frontier in hydrology and geoscience\n                                        \n\n\nThe projected exposure and response of a natural barrier island system to climate-driven coastal hazards\n                                        \n\nData availability\nDerived model outputs that were merged across overlapping model boundaries and compiled to county boundaries are available to download at https://doi.org/10.5066/P9H5PBXP.

      "\nAccessibility links\nFrom bridges and ports to a new regional hub\nBangladesh\u2019s evolving infrastructure\nSouth Asia\u2019s \"Land of Rivers\" has long faced infrastructure challenges, but from tunnels and bridges to a new deep-sea port, engineering is transforming Bangladesh.\nKnown as the \u201cLand of Rivers\u201d, Bangladesh owes its distinctive tasselled coastline to the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the world\u2019s largest river delta. A vast network of lakes and waterways criss-crosses the country\u2019s flat, low-lying terrain, meaning that most intercity journeys require negotiating one or more rivers. Couple the riverine landscape with risks including earthquakes and climate change, and it\u2019s easy to see how infrastructure bottlenecks have long inhibited Bangladesh\u2019s development.\nBut a new wave of investment is beginning to help overcome these issues. Bangladesh\u2019s longest bridge, the record-breaking Padma Bridge, extends for more than 6km (4 miles) across the turbulent Padma River. A four-lane highway and single-track railway connect 21 districts in southwest Bangladesh with the capital Dhaka, meaning\u00a0cargos of fresh produce that would sometimes rot while\u00a0in long ferry queues can reach their destination faster.\n\nThe nation\u2019s first road tunnel, Bangabandhu Tunnel, runs for more than 3km (2 miles) under the Karnaphuli river, uniting Chattogram port with Anwara opposite, and connecting two major economic corridors \u2013 the Dhaka-Chattogram and Chattogram-Cox\u2019s Bazar highways. It will also strengthen the Asian Highway Network, a road system spanning 32 countries.\nExpanding ports, expanding exports\nPorts are essential to Bangladesh\u2019s trade, but the two riverside seaports it inherited at independence, Chattogram and Mongla, are too shallow and lack the container handling capacity to keep up with the growth of trade and the ever-increasing scale of container ships.\nAs of 2020, Bangladesh\u2019s ports handled about 6,500 billion taka ($60 billion) in exports, with ship arrivals increasing at the rate of 11% per year. A dredging programme means the Payra seaport can now handle ships with a draft of up to 10.5m (35ft), which could be as long as 225m (740ft) and as wide as 30m (100ft). That said, many container ships still have to dock in India or Sri Lanka and collect or unload goods from Bangladesh using lighter vessels. This significantly adds to the cost of doing business, as well as slowing turnaround times due to the shortage of lighters.\n\nScheduled for completion at the end of 2026, the new Matarbari deep-sea port is set to transform Bangladesh\u2019s maritime infrastructure. It will be 18m (60ft) deep, with four container berths, plus room for further expansion.\n\u201cWe expect the port will handle around 10 million tons of cargo annually in the initial phase, increasing to 40 million tons in the long term,\u201d explains project director Mohammed Zafar Alam. \u201cThis will significantly reduce transportation costs and increase trade efficiency for Bangladesh.\u201d\nAlam estimates the port could increase Bangladesh\u2019s GDP by more than 1%, alongside decreasing import costs by 15% and export costs by 10%. For larger container ships, he expects to see 35 to 62 ships visit a year, potentially increasing to as many as 250.\nDeveloping the electric vehicle sector\nElectric vehicles (EVs) face specific reputational challenges in Bangladesh. On the streets of Dhaka, home-made electric rickshaws are a danger to life and limb: bicycle frames and, perhaps most importantly, brakes are not designed to sustain the speeds batteries deliver.\nBut the nation\u2019s improved road and bridge infrastructure is setting the scene for a new wave of EVs, which are more sustainable than the fossil-fuel vehicles that contribute about 15% of Dhaka\u2019s air pollution. The country\u2019s first EV manufacturing plant is under development in Chattogram.\n\u201cWell-maintained roads and bridges reduce travel times, increase accessibility and instil confidence among consumers regarding the reliability of EVs for long-distance travel,\u201d explains Hafizur Rahman Khan, chairman of Bangladesh\u2019s Runner Automobiles Plc. \u201cThis improved infrastructure also addresses concerns regarding range anxiety, a common barrier to EV adoption, by offering a network of routes with convenient charging facilities along the way.\u201d\n\nRunner Automobiles manufactures two- and three-wheeled fossil fuel-powered vehicles but has begun distributing electric two-wheelers and has a joint venture distributing electric cars. \u201cBangladesh's expanding middle-income demographic, experiencing increased affluence, is increasingly inclined towards personal transportation solutions,\u201d Khan notes. \u201cThis growing consumer base seeks convenient and cost-effective mobility options.\u201d\nWith Bangladesh on track to graduate from the UN\u2019s Least Developed Countries list in 2026, new infrastructure is helping open up the country\u2019s domestic and international trade. With 150 bridges opened on a single day in October 2023, it\u2019s possible the \u201cLand of Rivers\u201d could one day become the \u201cLand of Bridges\u201d.\n\nRise of the Bengal Tiger\nBangladesh invites businesses to be a part of its inspiring journey towards a prosperous future. Now, it\u2019s your time to invest in the mission of Smart Bangladesh.\nExplore the BBC\n",

Here we model a range of sea-level rise scenarios to assess the responses of water tables across the diverse topography and climates of the California coast. With 1\u2009m of sea-level rise, areas flooded from below are predicted to expand ~50\u2013130\u2009m inland, and low-lying coastal communities such as those around San Francisco Bay are most at risk. Coastal topography is a controlling factor; long-term rising water tables will intercept low-elevation drainage features, allowing for groundwater discharge that damps the extent of shoaling in ~70% (68.9\u201382.2%) of California\u2019s coastal water tables. Ignoring these topography-limited responses increases flooded-area forecasts by ~20% and substantially underestimates saltwater intrusion. All scenarios estimate that areas with shallow coastal water tables will shrink as they are inundated by overland flooding or are topographically limited from rising inland.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\n\n        Access Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n      \n\n        Get Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n      \n\n$29.99 /\u00a030\u00a0days\n\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA global analysis of subsidence, relative sea-level change and coastal flood exposure\n                                        \n\n\nThe coastal transition zone is an underexplored frontier in hydrology and geoscience\n                                        \n\n\nThe projected exposure and response of a natural barrier island system to climate-driven coastal hazards\n                                        \n\nData availability\nDerived model outputs that were merged across overlapping model boundaries and compiled to county boundaries are available to download at https://doi.org/10.5066/P9H5PBXP.

In the North Sea, fish have been comprehensively monitored throughout this period and resulting data provide a unique record of changes in distribution and abundance in response to climate change2,3. We use these data to demonstrate the remarkable power of generalized additive models (GAMs), trained on data earlier in the time series, to reliably predict trends in distribution and abundance in later years. Then, challenging process-based models that predict substantial and ongoing poleward shifts of cold-water species4,5, we find that GAMs coupled with climate projections predict future distributions of demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by availability of habitat of suitable depth. This will lead to pronounced changes in community structure, species interactions and commercial fisheries, unless individual acclimation or population-level evolutionary adaptations enable fish to tolerate warmer conditions or move to previously uninhabitable locations.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nShifting fish distributions in warming sub-Arctic oceans\n                                        \n\n\nFuture trends of marine fish biomass distributions from the North Sea to the Barents Sea\n                                        \n\n\nMarine fish traits follow fast-slow continuum across oceans\n                                        \n\nReferences\nSherman, K. & Hempel, G.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

Smallegange2, Anieke van Leeuwen1 1NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Department of Coastal Systems, and Utrecht University, 1797 SZ Texel, The Netherlands 2Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, 1012 WX Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABSTRACT: Distinct areas of seabed, called seascapes, are known to shape benthic habitats and communities, yet little is known about the extent to which they affect the dynamics of marine fish populations. We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2.

(2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. In (a) grey gurnard and (b) Atlantic herring, a few time-lagged exchanges occur from southern to northern seascapes, whereas in (c) drago -net, exchanges went from northern to southern and eastern to western seascapes. Other details as in Fig. 3 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed rounding areas following accumulation of biomass in the driving seascape. The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

In the North Sea, fish have been comprehensively monitored throughout this period and resulting data provide a unique record of changes in distribution and abundance in response to climate change2,3. We use these data to demonstrate the remarkable power of generalized additive models (GAMs), trained on data earlier in the time series, to reliably predict trends in distribution and abundance in later years. Then, challenging process-based models that predict substantial and ongoing poleward shifts of cold-water species4,5, we find that GAMs coupled with climate projections predict future distributions of demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by availability of habitat of suitable depth. This will lead to pronounced changes in community structure, species interactions and commercial fisheries, unless individual acclimation or population-level evolutionary adaptations enable fish to tolerate warmer conditions or move to previously uninhabitable locations.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nShifting fish distributions in warming sub-Arctic oceans\n                                        \n\n\nFuture trends of marine fish biomass distributions from the North Sea to the Barents Sea\n                                        \n\n\nMarine fish traits follow fast-slow continuum across oceans\n                                        \n\nReferences\nSherman, K. & Hempel, G.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

Smallegange2, Anieke van Leeuwen1 1NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Department of Coastal Systems, and Utrecht University, 1797 SZ Texel, The Netherlands 2Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, 1012 WX Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABSTRACT: Distinct areas of seabed, called seascapes, are known to shape benthic habitats and communities, yet little is known about the extent to which they affect the dynamics of marine fish populations. We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

Fish species, records and length to weight conversion used in the study. All length\u2212weight (L\u2212W) relationships were taken directly from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019). Slight differences in the number of filtered (unique) hauls between spe-cies originate from small differences in the raw North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey CPUE-length-per-hour datasets pulled from the ICES/DATRAS online database (ICES 2019) for each species (mean \u00b1 SD:13 667.2 \u00b1 104.9 filtered hauls, range 13 430\u221213 760 filtered hauls) Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 dependencies in fish biomass density between sea-scapes. If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2.

Common drivers and in direct ef-fects can yield spurious associations that are accounted for in our approach. The dots in panel b represent observed biomass density values, the blue line is a fitted trend with 95% confidence bounds indicated in gray shading. Figure adapted from Runge et al. (2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. In (a) grey gurnard and (b) Atlantic herring, a few time-lagged exchanges occur from southern to northern seascapes, whereas in (c) drago -net, exchanges went from northern to southern and eastern to western seascapes. Other details as in Fig. 3 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed rounding areas following accumulation of biomass in the driving seascape. The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

Fish species, records and length to weight conversion used in the study. All length\u2212weight (L\u2212W) relationships were taken directly from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019). Slight differences in the number of filtered (unique) hauls between spe-cies originate from small differences in the raw North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey CPUE-length-per-hour datasets pulled from the ICES/DATRAS online database (ICES 2019) for each species (mean \u00b1 SD:13 667.2 \u00b1 104.9 filtered hauls, range 13 430\u221213 760 filtered hauls) Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 dependencies in fish biomass density between sea-scapes. If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2. (a) Each of the 10 seascapes (green circles) has (b) an associated time series of fish biomass density, e.g. S1\u2212S4, of which we estimate the underlying causal dependency structure in (c) a causal association network. Common drivers and in direct ef-fects can yield spurious associations that are accounted for in our approach. The dots in panel b represent observed biomass density values, the blue line is a fitted trend with 95% confidence bounds indicated in gray shading. Figure adapted from Runge et al. (2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea. The relationship was expressed as 134 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9 S10 S1 P, E A L, Cl P L, M Cl G, A, L S2 E G, L S P S3 A, Cl E S, Cl S4 E P, S L G S5 S6 L L, A, Cl E, A, Cl S7 M, Cl S8 S9 S10 Table 2.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. In (a) grey gurnard and (b) Atlantic herring, a few time-lagged exchanges occur from southern to northern seascapes, whereas in (c) drago -net, exchanges went from northern to southern and eastern to western seascapes. Other details as in Fig. 3 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed rounding areas following accumulation of biomass in the driving seascape. The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

What is budget trend analysis and why is it important?\nbudget trend analysis is a method of examining the past and future performance of a budget by comparing actual results with planned or projected ones. It can help identify the causes and effects of changes in the budget over time, as well as the opportunities and challenges for improvement. Budget trend analysis is important for several reasons, such as:\n1. It can help monitor and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of budget allocation and spending. By analyzing the trends of revenues and expenditures, one can assess whether the budget is aligned with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization or project, and whether the resources are used optimally and appropriately.\n2. It can help forecast and plan for future budget needs and adjustments. By analyzing the trends of external and internal factors that affect the budget, such as inflation, market demand, customer behavior, competitor actions, regulatory changes, etc., one can anticipate the potential impacts and risks on the budget, and prepare contingency plans or corrective actions accordingly.\n3. It can help communicate and justify the budget decisions and results to stakeholders. By analyzing the trends of key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmarks, such as return on investment (ROI), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), variance analysis, etc., one can demonstrate the value and impact of the budget, and explain the reasons and rationale behind the budget choices and outcomes.\nFor example, suppose a company wants to analyze its budget trend for the past three years and project its budget for the next year. It can use the following steps:\n- Collect and organize the historical and projected data of the budget, such as revenues, expenses, profits, etc., for each year, quarter, month, or other period of interest.\n- Calculate and compare the percentage changes, growth rates, averages, ratios, and other metrics of the budget data, and identify the patterns and variations of the budget over time.\n- analyze the causes and effects of the budget changes, and evaluate the performance and progress of the budget against the planned or expected targets and standards.\n- identify the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and challenges and solutions of the budget, and formulate recommendations and action plans for improvement.\n- Present and report the budget trend analysis results and findings, using charts, graphs, tables, and other visual aids, and highlight the key insights and implications for the budget decision-making and management.\n2. How to collect and prepare historical and projected data for budget trend analysis?\nOne of the most important steps in budget trend analysis is to collect and prepare the data that will be used to identify and explain the budget patterns and changes over time. The data sources and methods for this task may vary depending on the scope, purpose, and context of the analysis. However, some general principles and best practices can be followed to ensure the quality and reliability of the data. In this section, we will discuss how to select, obtain, and process historical and projected data for budget trend analysis. We will also provide some examples of data sources and methods that can be used for different types of budget analysis.\nThe following are some of the main aspects to consider when collecting and preparing data for budget trend analysis:\n1. Data selection: The first step is to determine what kind of data is needed for the analysis. This depends on the level of detail, the time period, and the budget categories that are of interest. For example, if the analysis aims to compare the budget allocations of different departments or programs, then the data should include the breakdown of the budget by these categories. If the analysis focuses on the changes in the budget over time, then the data should cover a sufficiently long time period to capture the trends and fluctuations. Some possible data sources for budget data are:\n- Official budget documents: These are the official records of the budget approved by the government or the legislature. They usually provide the most comprehensive and authoritative information on the budget, but they may not be easily accessible or updated.\n- Budget databases: These are online platforms that store and display budget data in a user-friendly format. They may offer more flexibility and functionality than budget documents, such as allowing users to download, filter, and visualize the data. However, they may not have the same level of detail or accuracy as budget documents.\n- Budget reports: These are publications that analyze and summarize the budget data and provide additional information and insights. They may be produced by the government, civil society organizations, or research institutions. They can be useful for understanding the context and rationale behind the budget decisions, but they may not have the same level of objectivity or completeness as budget documents or databases.\n2. Data acquisition: The next step is to obtain the data from the selected sources. This may involve different methods depending on the availability and format of the data. For example, if the data is available online, then it can be downloaded or scraped from the website. If the data is in a PDF or an image file, then it may need to be converted or extracted using optical character recognition (OCR) or other tools. If the data is not available online, then it may need to be requested from the data provider or obtained from other sources. Some possible methods for data acquisition are:\n- Downloading: This is the simplest and fastest method for obtaining data that is available online in a downloadable format, such as Excel, CSV, or JSON. It involves saving the data file to the local computer or a cloud storage service.\n- Scraping: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but not in a downloadable format, such as HTML, XML, or JavaScript. It involves writing a script or using a tool that can extract the data from the web page and save it in a structured format.\n- Converting: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but in a non-machine-readable format, such as PDF or image. It involves using a tool that can convert the data into a machine-readable format, such as Excel, CSV, or JSON.\n- Extracting: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but in a partially machine-readable format, such as PDF or image with tables or charts. It involves using a tool that can extract the data from the tables or charts and save it in a structured format.\n- Requesting: This is a method for obtaining data that is not available online or in a machine-readable format, such as paper documents or proprietary formats. It involves contacting the data provider and requesting the data in a suitable format.\n- Obtaining: This is a method for obtaining data that is not available from the original source or in a suitable format, such as unofficial or alternative sources. It involves finding and accessing the data from other sources, such as third-party websites, media reports, or personal contacts.\n3. Data processing: The final step is to prepare the data for the analysis. This may involve different tasks depending on the quality and consistency of the data. For example, if the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated, then it may need to be verified, corrected, or updated. If the data is inconsistent, incompatible, or incomparable, then it may need to be harmonized, standardized, or normalized. If the data is too complex, large, or noisy, then it may need to be simplified, aggregated, or filtered. Some possible tasks for data processing are:\n- Verifying: This is a task for ensuring the validity and reliability of the data. It involves checking the data for errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies, and comparing the data with other sources or references.\n- Correcting: This is a task for improving the accuracy and completeness of the data. It involves fixing the errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies in the data, and filling the gaps or missing values in the data.\n- Updating: This is a task for enhancing the timeliness and relevance of the data. It involves adding the latest or most recent data to the existing data, and removing the outdated or obsolete data from the existing data.\n- Harmonizing: This is a task for ensuring the compatibility and comparability of the data. It involves aligning the data with a common definition, classification, or format, and resolving the differences or discrepancies in the data.\n- Standardizing: This is a task for ensuring the consistency and uniformity of the data. It involves applying a common rule, method, or procedure to the data, and converting the data into a common unit, scale, or measure.\n- Normalizing: This is a task for ensuring the fairness and equity of the data. It involves adjusting the data for the effects of external factors, such as inflation, population, or geography, and expressing the data in relative terms, such as percentages, ratios, or indexes.\n- Simplifying: This is a task for reducing the complexity and size of the data. It involves summarizing the data with descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, range, or standard deviation, and grouping the data into categories, clusters, or segments.\n- Aggregating: This is a task for increasing the level of detail and granularity of the data. It involves combining the data from multiple sources, dimensions, or variables, and calculating the total, average, or other aggregate functions for the data.\n- Filtering: This is a task for removing the noise and irrelevance from the data. It involves selecting the data that meets certain criteria, conditions, or thresholds, and excluding the data that does not meet them.\nBy following these steps, the data can be collected and prepared for budget trend analysis. The data sources and methods may vary depending on the specific needs and objectives of the analysis, but the general principles and best practices can be applied to any type of budget data. The quality and reliability of the data can have a significant impact on the results and conclusions of the analysis, so it is important to ensure that the data is valid, accurate, complete, consistent, compatible, comparable, fair, and relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to collect and prepare historical and projected data for budget trend analysis - Budget trend analysis: How to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes\n3. How to define and measure the key aspects of your budget performance and goals?\nBudget performance\nPerformance Against Goals\nOne of the most important steps in budget trend analysis is to identify the budget categories and indicators that will help you track and evaluate your budget performance and goals. Budget categories are the broad groups of expenses or revenues that you want to analyze, such as personnel, supplies, utilities, sales, grants, etc. Budget indicators are the specific metrics or ratios that you want to measure, such as spending per employee, revenue growth rate, profit margin, etc. By defining and measuring these key aspects of your budget, you can gain insights into your budget patterns and changes over time, and compare them with your targets or benchmarks. In this section, we will discuss how to choose the appropriate budget categories and indicators for your budget trend analysis, and how to use them effectively. Here are some tips and examples to guide you:\n1. Choose budget categories that are relevant and meaningful for your organization or project. Depending on the size, scope, and nature of your budget, you may have different levels of budget categories, such as major, minor, or sub-categories. For example, a large corporation may have major categories such as operating expenses, capital expenditures, and income taxes, and minor categories such as marketing, research and development, and interest payments. A small nonprofit organization may have major categories such as program expenses, administrative expenses, and fundraising expenses, and minor categories such as salaries, travel, and rent. You should choose budget categories that reflect the main sources and uses of your funds, and that align with your strategic goals and objectives.\n2. Choose budget indicators that are relevant and measurable for your budget categories. Budget indicators are the numerical values that you use to assess your budget performance and goals. They can be absolute numbers, such as total revenue or total expenses, or relative numbers, such as percentages, ratios, or averages. You should choose budget indicators that are meaningful and informative for your budget categories, and that can be easily calculated and compared over time. For example, if you want to analyze your personnel expenses, you may use indicators such as headcount, payroll, benefits, turnover rate, or productivity. If you want to analyze your sales revenue, you may use indicators such as sales volume, sales price, market share, or customer satisfaction.\n3. Use a combination of budget indicators to get a comprehensive and balanced view of your budget performance and goals. Budget indicators can be classified into different types, such as input, output, outcome, efficiency, or effectiveness indicators. Input indicators measure the resources or inputs that you use for your budget, such as money, time, or staff. Output indicators measure the products or services that you produce or deliver with your budget, such as units, customers, or events. Outcome indicators measure the results or impacts that you achieve or influence with your budget, such as quality, satisfaction, or change. Efficiency indicators measure how well you use your inputs to produce outputs, such as cost per unit, time per customer, or staff per event. Effectiveness indicators measure how well you achieve your outcomes with your outputs, such as quality per unit, satisfaction per customer, or change per event. You should use a mix of these types of indicators to capture the different dimensions of your budget performance and goals, and to avoid focusing on only one aspect. For example, if you want to analyze your program expenses, you may use input indicators such as budget allocation, output indicators such as number of beneficiaries, outcome indicators such as impact evaluation, efficiency indicators such as cost per beneficiary, and effectiveness indicators such as impact per beneficiary.\n4. How to use projected data to create and compare different budget scenarios and outcomes?\nscenario analysis is a powerful tool that allows organizations to assess the potential impact of different budget scenarios and make informed decisions. By utilizing historical and projected data, businesses can gain valuable insights into their budget patterns and changes. In this section, we will explore the process of conducting scenario analysis and its significance in budget trend analysis.\n1. Understanding Scenario Analysis:\nScenario analysis involves creating multiple hypothetical scenarios based on different assumptions and variables. These scenarios help organizations evaluate the potential outcomes and risks associated with each scenario. By considering various factors such as market conditions, economic trends, and internal factors, businesses can gain a comprehensive understanding of their budget's performance.\n2. Creating Budget Scenarios:\nTo begin the scenario analysis, organizations need to identify the key variables that impact their budget. These variables can include factors like revenue growth, cost fluctuations, market demand, and regulatory changes. By adjusting these variables within different scenarios, businesses can simulate various budget scenarios and assess their potential impact.\n3. Comparing Budget Scenarios:\nOnce the budget scenarios are created, organizations can compare them to understand the differences in outcomes. This comparison helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each scenario and enables decision-makers to make informed choices. By analyzing the variations in revenue, expenses, profitability, and cash flow, businesses can evaluate the financial implications of each scenario.\n4. Assessing Risks and Opportunities:\nScenario analysis also allows organizations to assess the risks and opportunities associated with each budget scenario. By considering different market conditions and external factors, businesses can identify potential risks that may impact their budget performance. Additionally, scenario analysis helps in identifying opportunities for growth and optimization within the budget.\n5. Using Examples to Highlight Ideas:\nTo provide a better understanding, let's consider an example. Imagine a retail company planning its budget for the upcoming year. They create two scenarios: Scenario A assumes a moderate increase in sales due to market growth, while Scenario B considers a decline in sales due to increased competition. By comparing these scenarios, the company can assess the potential impact on revenue, expenses, and profitability. This analysis helps them make strategic decisions to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.\nScenario analysis using projected data is a valuable technique for budget trend analysis. By creating and comparing different budget scenarios, organizations can gain insights into their budget patterns, assess risks and opportunities, and make informed decisions. It empowers businesses to adapt to changing market conditions and optimize their financial performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use projected data to create and compare different budget scenarios and outcomes - Budget trend analysis: How to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes\n5. How to summarize your main findings and insights from your budget trend analysis?\nIn this blog, we have discussed how to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes. We have seen how to collect, organize, and visualize your budget data using various tools and techniques. We have also learned how to identify and explain the trends, patterns, and outliers in your budget data, and how to use them to make informed decisions and projections. In this final section, we will summarize our main findings and insights from our budget trend analysis, and provide some tips and best practices for conducting your own budget trend analysis.\nHere are some of the key points to remember when summarizing your budget trend analysis:\n- Use a clear and concise summary statement. A summary statement is a sentence or two that captures the main message or takeaway of your budget trend analysis. It should answer the question: What did you learn from your budget trend analysis? For example, you could say: \"Our budget trend analysis revealed that our income has increased steadily over the past five years, while our expenses have fluctuated significantly due to seasonal and unexpected factors. We also found that our savings rate has improved over time, but we still need to work on reducing our debt and increasing our emergency fund.\"\n- Highlight the most important and relevant findings and insights. After stating your summary statement, you should elaborate on the most important and relevant findings and insights that support your summary statement. You should focus on the findings and insights that are most relevant to your budget goals, objectives, and questions. You should also explain how your findings and insights can help you improve your budget performance and planning. For example, you could say: \"Some of the key findings and insights from our budget trend analysis are:\n1. Our income has increased steadily over the past five years, mainly due to our career advancement and salary raises. This shows that we have been successful in growing our income and achieving our career goals. However, we also noticed that our income growth rate has slowed down in the last year, which could indicate a potential plateau or decline in our income in the future. Therefore, we should consider diversifying our income sources and exploring new opportunities for income growth.\n2. Our expenses have fluctuated significantly over the past five years, due to seasonal and unexpected factors. We observed that our expenses tend to spike in the months of December and January, due to the holiday season and the winter heating costs. We also noticed that our expenses have increased in the last two years, due to some major life events, such as buying a new car, renovating our house, and having a baby. These factors have impacted our budget balance and our ability to save and invest. Therefore, we should review our spending habits and prioritize our needs and wants. We should also create a realistic and flexible budget that can accommodate our changing needs and circumstances.\n3. Our savings rate has improved over time, but we still need to work on reducing our debt and increasing our emergency fund. We found that our savings rate has increased from 10% to 15% of our income over the past five years, which is above the average savings rate of 8.8% in the US. This shows that we have been disciplined and consistent in saving and investing our money. However, we also found that our debt-to-income ratio has increased from 25% to 35% over the same period, which is above the recommended ratio of 20% or less. This means that we are spending more than we can afford on debt payments, which can affect our credit score and our financial security. Therefore, we should pay off our high-interest debt as soon as possible and avoid taking on new debt. We should also increase our emergency fund to cover at least six months of our living expenses, in case of any unforeseen events or emergencies.\"\n- Use visual aids to support your summary. Visual aids, such as charts, graphs, tables, and diagrams, can help you present your budget data and findings in a clear and engaging way. They can also help you highlight the trends, patterns, and outliers in your budget data, and compare and contrast your budget performance and projections. You should use visual aids that are appropriate for your budget data and analysis, and that can convey your message effectively. For example, you could use a line chart to show the changes in your income and expenses over time, a pie chart to show the distribution of your expenses by category, or a bar chart to show the comparison of your budget performance and projections by month or year. You should also label your visual aids properly and provide a brief explanation or interpretation of what they show. For example, you could say: \"The following line chart shows the changes in our income and expenses over the past five years. As you can see, our income has increased steadily, while our expenses have fluctuated significantly. The gap between our income and expenses represents our budget surplus or deficit, which indicates our budget balance and our ability to save and invest.\"\n```markdown\n![Line chart of income and expenses over time](line_chart.\n6. How to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis?\nData and Information\nOne of the most important aspects of writing a budget trend analysis is to properly cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your analysis. This not only shows respect for the original authors and their work, but also enhances the credibility and reliability of your analysis. Moreover, citing and acknowledging sources helps you avoid plagiarism, which is a serious academic and professional offense. In this section, we will discuss how to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis, following some general guidelines and best practices. We will also provide some examples of common citation styles and formats that you can use in your analysis.\nHere are some steps that you can follow to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis:\n1. Identify the type and format of the source. Different types of sources, such as books, journals, websites, reports, etc., may have different citation requirements and formats. For example, a book citation usually includes the author's name, the title of the book, the publisher, the year of publication, and the page number. A website citation usually includes the author's name, the title of the web page, the URL, and the date of access. You should also consider the format of the source, such as print, online, PDF, etc., as this may affect the citation style and format as well.\n2. Choose a citation style and format that suits your purpose and audience. There are many citation styles and formats that you can use in your budget trend analysis, such as APA, MLA, Chicago, Harvard, etc. Each citation style and format has its own rules and conventions for citing and acknowledging sources. You should choose a citation style and format that suits your purpose and audience, and that is consistent with the standards and expectations of your field or discipline. For example, if you are writing a budget trend analysis for a business or management course, you may want to use the APA style, which is commonly used in social sciences. If you are writing a budget trend analysis for a history or humanities course, you may want to use the Chicago style, which is commonly used in history and humanities. You should also check with your instructor, supervisor, or publisher for any specific citation requirements or preferences that they may have.\n3. Follow the citation rules and conventions of your chosen citation style and format. Once you have chosen a citation style and format, you should follow the citation rules and conventions of that style and format throughout your budget trend analysis. You should pay attention to the details and nuances of the citation style and format, such as punctuation, capitalization, indentation, spacing, etc. You should also make sure that your citations are accurate, complete, and consistent. You should avoid mixing different citation styles and formats, as this may confuse your readers and undermine your credibility. You should also avoid using outdated or unreliable sources, as this may compromise the quality and validity of your analysis.\n4. Provide a list of references or a bibliography at the end of your budget trend analysis. In addition to citing and acknowledging the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis within the text, you should also provide a list of references or a bibliography at the end of your budget trend analysis. A list of references or a bibliography is a comprehensive and alphabetical list of all the sources that you have cited and acknowledged in your analysis. It provides the full details and information of each source, such as the author's name, the title of the source, the publisher, the year of publication, the URL, etc. A list of references or a bibliography helps your readers to locate and access the sources that you have used in your analysis, and to verify and evaluate the information and data that you have presented. You should follow the same citation style and format that you have used in your analysis for your list of references or a bibliography, and make sure that it is consistent and error-free.\nHere are some examples of common citation styles and formats that you can use in your budget trend analysis:\n- APA style: This is a citation style and format that is commonly used in social sciences, such as psychology, education, business, etc. It uses the author-date system for in-text citations, and provides a list of references at the end of the analysis. For example:\nIn-text citation: (Smith, 2020, p. 15)\nReference list entry: Smith, J. (2020). Budget trends and patterns in the retail industry. ABC Publishing.\n- MLA style: This is a citation style and format that is commonly used in humanities, such as literature, language, art, etc. It uses the author-page system for in-text citations, and provides a works cited list at the end of the analysis. For example:\nIn-text citation: (Smith 15)\nWorks cited list entry: Smith, John. Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry. ABC Publishing, 2020.\n- Chicago style: This is a citation style and format that is commonly used in history and humanities. It uses the notes-bibliography system or the author-date system for in-text citations, and provides a bibliography or a list of references at the end of the analysis. For example:\nNotes-bibliography system:\nIn-text citation: 1. John Smith, Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry (ABC Publishing, 2020), 15.\nBibliography entry: Smith, John. Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry. ABC Publishing, 2020.\nAuthor-date system:\nIn-text citation: (Smith 2020, 15)\nReference list entry: Smith, John. 2020. Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry. ABC Publishing.\nThese are some of the general guidelines and best practices for citing and acknowledging the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis. By following these steps and examples, you can ensure that your budget trend analysis is well-researched, well-written, and well-referenced. You can also avoid plagiarism, enhance your credibility, and respect the original authors and their work.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

Fish species, records and length to weight conversion used in the study. All length\u2212weight (L\u2212W) relationships were taken directly from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019). Slight differences in the number of filtered (unique) hauls between spe-cies originate from small differences in the raw North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey CPUE-length-per-hour datasets pulled from the ICES/DATRAS online database (ICES 2019) for each species (mean \u00b1 SD:13 667.2 \u00b1 104.9 filtered hauls, range 13 430\u221213 760 filtered hauls) Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 dependencies in fish biomass density between sea-scapes. If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2. (a) Each of the 10 seascapes (green circles) has (b) an associated time series of fish biomass density, e.g. S1\u2212S4, of which we estimate the underlying causal dependency structure in (c) a causal association network. Common drivers and in direct ef-fects can yield spurious associations that are accounted for in our approach. The dots in panel b represent observed biomass density values, the blue line is a fitted trend with 95% confidence bounds indicated in gray shading. Figure adapted from Runge et al. (2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea. The relationship was expressed as 134 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9 S10 S1 P, E A L, Cl P L, M Cl G, A, L S2 E G, L S P S3 A, Cl E S, Cl S4 E P, S L G S5 S6 L L, A, Cl E, A, Cl S7 M, Cl S8 S9 S10 Table 2.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. In (a) grey gurnard and (b) Atlantic herring, a few time-lagged exchanges occur from southern to northern seascapes, whereas in (c) drago -net, exchanges went from northern to southern and eastern to western seascapes. Other details as in Fig. 3 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed rounding areas following accumulation of biomass in the driving seascape. The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

What is budget trend analysis and why is it important?\nbudget trend analysis is a method of examining the past and future performance of a budget by comparing actual results with planned or projected ones. It can help identify the causes and effects of changes in the budget over time, as well as the opportunities and challenges for improvement. Budget trend analysis is important for several reasons, such as:\n1. It can help monitor and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of budget allocation and spending. By analyzing the trends of revenues and expenditures, one can assess whether the budget is aligned with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization or project, and whether the resources are used optimally and appropriately.\n2. It can help forecast and plan for future budget needs and adjustments. By analyzing the trends of external and internal factors that affect the budget, such as inflation, market demand, customer behavior, competitor actions, regulatory changes, etc., one can anticipate the potential impacts and risks on the budget, and prepare contingency plans or corrective actions accordingly.\n3. It can help communicate and justify the budget decisions and results to stakeholders. By analyzing the trends of key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmarks, such as return on investment (ROI), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), variance analysis, etc., one can demonstrate the value and impact of the budget, and explain the reasons and rationale behind the budget choices and outcomes.\nFor example, suppose a company wants to analyze its budget trend for the past three years and project its budget for the next year. It can use the following steps:\n- Collect and organize the historical and projected data of the budget, such as revenues, expenses, profits, etc., for each year, quarter, month, or other period of interest.\n- Calculate and compare the percentage changes, growth rates, averages, ratios, and other metrics of the budget data, and identify the patterns and variations of the budget over time.\n- analyze the causes and effects of the budget changes, and evaluate the performance and progress of the budget against the planned or expected targets and standards.\n- identify the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and challenges and solutions of the budget, and formulate recommendations and action plans for improvement.\n- Present and report the budget trend analysis results and findings, using charts, graphs, tables, and other visual aids, and highlight the key insights and implications for the budget decision-making and management.\n2. How to collect and prepare historical and projected data for budget trend analysis?\nOne of the most important steps in budget trend analysis is to collect and prepare the data that will be used to identify and explain the budget patterns and changes over time. The data sources and methods for this task may vary depending on the scope, purpose, and context of the analysis. However, some general principles and best practices can be followed to ensure the quality and reliability of the data. In this section, we will discuss how to select, obtain, and process historical and projected data for budget trend analysis. We will also provide some examples of data sources and methods that can be used for different types of budget analysis.\nThe following are some of the main aspects to consider when collecting and preparing data for budget trend analysis:\n1. Data selection: The first step is to determine what kind of data is needed for the analysis. This depends on the level of detail, the time period, and the budget categories that are of interest. For example, if the analysis aims to compare the budget allocations of different departments or programs, then the data should include the breakdown of the budget by these categories. If the analysis focuses on the changes in the budget over time, then the data should cover a sufficiently long time period to capture the trends and fluctuations. Some possible data sources for budget data are:\n- Official budget documents: These are the official records of the budget approved by the government or the legislature. They usually provide the most comprehensive and authoritative information on the budget, but they may not be easily accessible or updated.\n- Budget databases: These are online platforms that store and display budget data in a user-friendly format. They may offer more flexibility and functionality than budget documents, such as allowing users to download, filter, and visualize the data. However, they may not have the same level of detail or accuracy as budget documents.\n- Budget reports: These are publications that analyze and summarize the budget data and provide additional information and insights. They may be produced by the government, civil society organizations, or research institutions. They can be useful for understanding the context and rationale behind the budget decisions, but they may not have the same level of objectivity or completeness as budget documents or databases.\n2. Data acquisition: The next step is to obtain the data from the selected sources. This may involve different methods depending on the availability and format of the data. For example, if the data is available online, then it can be downloaded or scraped from the website. If the data is in a PDF or an image file, then it may need to be converted or extracted using optical character recognition (OCR) or other tools. If the data is not available online, then it may need to be requested from the data provider or obtained from other sources. Some possible methods for data acquisition are:\n- Downloading: This is the simplest and fastest method for obtaining data that is available online in a downloadable format, such as Excel, CSV, or JSON. It involves saving the data file to the local computer or a cloud storage service.\n- Scraping: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but not in a downloadable format, such as HTML, XML, or JavaScript. It involves writing a script or using a tool that can extract the data from the web page and save it in a structured format.\n- Converting: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but in a non-machine-readable format, such as PDF or image. It involves using a tool that can convert the data into a machine-readable format, such as Excel, CSV, or JSON.\n- Extracting: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but in a partially machine-readable format, such as PDF or image with tables or charts. It involves using a tool that can extract the data from the tables or charts and save it in a structured format.\n- Requesting: This is a method for obtaining data that is not available online or in a machine-readable format, such as paper documents or proprietary formats. It involves contacting the data provider and requesting the data in a suitable format.\n- Obtaining: This is a method for obtaining data that is not available from the original source or in a suitable format, such as unofficial or alternative sources. It involves finding and accessing the data from other sources, such as third-party websites, media reports, or personal contacts.\n3. Data processing: The final step is to prepare the data for the analysis. This may involve different tasks depending on the quality and consistency of the data. For example, if the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated, then it may need to be verified, corrected, or updated. If the data is inconsistent, incompatible, or incomparable, then it may need to be harmonized, standardized, or normalized. If the data is too complex, large, or noisy, then it may need to be simplified, aggregated, or filtered. Some possible tasks for data processing are:\n- Verifying: This is a task for ensuring the validity and reliability of the data. It involves checking the data for errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies, and comparing the data with other sources or references.\n- Correcting: This is a task for improving the accuracy and completeness of the data. It involves fixing the errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies in the data, and filling the gaps or missing values in the data.\n- Updating: This is a task for enhancing the timeliness and relevance of the data. It involves adding the latest or most recent data to the existing data, and removing the outdated or obsolete data from the existing data.\n- Harmonizing: This is a task for ensuring the compatibility and comparability of the data. It involves aligning the data with a common definition, classification, or format, and resolving the differences or discrepancies in the data.\n- Standardizing: This is a task for ensuring the consistency and uniformity of the data. It involves applying a common rule, method, or procedure to the data, and converting the data into a common unit, scale, or measure.\n- Normalizing: This is a task for ensuring the fairness and equity of the data. It involves adjusting the data for the effects of external factors, such as inflation, population, or geography, and expressing the data in relative terms, such as percentages, ratios, or indexes.\n- Simplifying: This is a task for reducing the complexity and size of the data. It involves summarizing the data with descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, range, or standard deviation, and grouping the data into categories, clusters, or segments.\n- Aggregating: This is a task for increasing the level of detail and granularity of the data. It involves combining the data from multiple sources, dimensions, or variables, and calculating the total, average, or other aggregate functions for the data.\n- Filtering: This is a task for removing the noise and irrelevance from the data. It involves selecting the data that meets certain criteria, conditions, or thresholds, and excluding the data that does not meet them.\nBy following these steps, the data can be collected and prepared for budget trend analysis. The data sources and methods may vary depending on the specific needs and objectives of the analysis, but the general principles and best practices can be applied to any type of budget data. The quality and reliability of the data can have a significant impact on the results and conclusions of the analysis, so it is important to ensure that the data is valid, accurate, complete, consistent, compatible, comparable, fair, and relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to collect and prepare historical and projected data for budget trend analysis - Budget trend analysis: How to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes\n3. How to define and measure the key aspects of your budget performance and goals?\nBudget performance\nPerformance Against Goals\nOne of the most important steps in budget trend analysis is to identify the budget categories and indicators that will help you track and evaluate your budget performance and goals. Budget categories are the broad groups of expenses or revenues that you want to analyze, such as personnel, supplies, utilities, sales, grants, etc. Budget indicators are the specific metrics or ratios that you want to measure, such as spending per employee, revenue growth rate, profit margin, etc. By defining and measuring these key aspects of your budget, you can gain insights into your budget patterns and changes over time, and compare them with your targets or benchmarks. In this section, we will discuss how to choose the appropriate budget categories and indicators for your budget trend analysis, and how to use them effectively. Here are some tips and examples to guide you:\n1. Choose budget categories that are relevant and meaningful for your organization or project. Depending on the size, scope, and nature of your budget, you may have different levels of budget categories, such as major, minor, or sub-categories. For example, a large corporation may have major categories such as operating expenses, capital expenditures, and income taxes, and minor categories such as marketing, research and development, and interest payments. A small nonprofit organization may have major categories such as program expenses, administrative expenses, and fundraising expenses, and minor categories such as salaries, travel, and rent. You should choose budget categories that reflect the main sources and uses of your funds, and that align with your strategic goals and objectives.\n2. Choose budget indicators that are relevant and measurable for your budget categories. Budget indicators are the numerical values that you use to assess your budget performance and goals. They can be absolute numbers, such as total revenue or total expenses, or relative numbers, such as percentages, ratios, or averages. You should choose budget indicators that are meaningful and informative for your budget categories, and that can be easily calculated and compared over time. For example, if you want to analyze your personnel expenses, you may use indicators such as headcount, payroll, benefits, turnover rate, or productivity. If you want to analyze your sales revenue, you may use indicators such as sales volume, sales price, market share, or customer satisfaction.\n3. Use a combination of budget indicators to get a comprehensive and balanced view of your budget performance and goals. Budget indicators can be classified into different types, such as input, output, outcome, efficiency, or effectiveness indicators. Input indicators measure the resources or inputs that you use for your budget, such as money, time, or staff. Output indicators measure the products or services that you produce or deliver with your budget, such as units, customers, or events. Outcome indicators measure the results or impacts that you achieve or influence with your budget, such as quality, satisfaction, or change. Efficiency indicators measure how well you use your inputs to produce outputs, such as cost per unit, time per customer, or staff per event. Effectiveness indicators measure how well you achieve your outcomes with your outputs, such as quality per unit, satisfaction per customer, or change per event. You should use a mix of these types of indicators to capture the different dimensions of your budget performance and goals, and to avoid focusing on only one aspect. For example, if you want to analyze your program expenses, you may use input indicators such as budget allocation, output indicators such as number of beneficiaries, outcome indicators such as impact evaluation, efficiency indicators such as cost per beneficiary, and effectiveness indicators such as impact per beneficiary.\n4. How to use projected data to create and compare different budget scenarios and outcomes?\nscenario analysis is a powerful tool that allows organizations to assess the potential impact of different budget scenarios and make informed decisions. By utilizing historical and projected data, businesses can gain valuable insights into their budget patterns and changes. In this section, we will explore the process of conducting scenario analysis and its significance in budget trend analysis.\n1. Understanding Scenario Analysis:\nScenario analysis involves creating multiple hypothetical scenarios based on different assumptions and variables. These scenarios help organizations evaluate the potential outcomes and risks associated with each scenario. By considering various factors such as market conditions, economic trends, and internal factors, businesses can gain a comprehensive understanding of their budget's performance.\n2. Creating Budget Scenarios:\nTo begin the scenario analysis, organizations need to identify the key variables that impact their budget. These variables can include factors like revenue growth, cost fluctuations, market demand, and regulatory changes. By adjusting these variables within different scenarios, businesses can simulate various budget scenarios and assess their potential impact.\n3. Comparing Budget Scenarios:\nOnce the budget scenarios are created, organizations can compare them to understand the differences in outcomes. This comparison helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each scenario and enables decision-makers to make informed choices. By analyzing the variations in revenue, expenses, profitability, and cash flow, businesses can evaluate the financial implications of each scenario.\n4. Assessing Risks and Opportunities:\nScenario analysis also allows organizations to assess the risks and opportunities associated with each budget scenario. By considering different market conditions and external factors, businesses can identify potential risks that may impact their budget performance. Additionally, scenario analysis helps in identifying opportunities for growth and optimization within the budget.\n5. Using Examples to Highlight Ideas:\nTo provide a better understanding, let's consider an example. Imagine a retail company planning its budget for the upcoming year. They create two scenarios: Scenario A assumes a moderate increase in sales due to market growth, while Scenario B considers a decline in sales due to increased competition. By comparing these scenarios, the company can assess the potential impact on revenue, expenses, and profitability. This analysis helps them make strategic decisions to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.\nScenario analysis using projected data is a valuable technique for budget trend analysis. By creating and comparing different budget scenarios, organizations can gain insights into their budget patterns, assess risks and opportunities, and make informed decisions. It empowers businesses to adapt to changing market conditions and optimize their financial performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use projected data to create and compare different budget scenarios and outcomes - Budget trend analysis: How to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes\n5. How to summarize your main findings and insights from your budget trend analysis?\nIn this blog, we have discussed how to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes. We have seen how to collect, organize, and visualize your budget data using various tools and techniques. We have also learned how to identify and explain the trends, patterns, and outliers in your budget data, and how to use them to make informed decisions and projections. In this final section, we will summarize our main findings and insights from our budget trend analysis, and provide some tips and best practices for conducting your own budget trend analysis.\nHere are some of the key points to remember when summarizing your budget trend analysis:\n- Use a clear and concise summary statement. A summary statement is a sentence or two that captures the main message or takeaway of your budget trend analysis. It should answer the question: What did you learn from your budget trend analysis? For example, you could say: \"Our budget trend analysis revealed that our income has increased steadily over the past five years, while our expenses have fluctuated significantly due to seasonal and unexpected factors. We also found that our savings rate has improved over time, but we still need to work on reducing our debt and increasing our emergency fund.\"\n- Highlight the most important and relevant findings and insights. After stating your summary statement, you should elaborate on the most important and relevant findings and insights that support your summary statement. You should focus on the findings and insights that are most relevant to your budget goals, objectives, and questions. You should also explain how your findings and insights can help you improve your budget performance and planning. For example, you could say: \"Some of the key findings and insights from our budget trend analysis are:\n1. Our income has increased steadily over the past five years, mainly due to our career advancement and salary raises. This shows that we have been successful in growing our income and achieving our career goals. However, we also noticed that our income growth rate has slowed down in the last year, which could indicate a potential plateau or decline in our income in the future. Therefore, we should consider diversifying our income sources and exploring new opportunities for income growth.\n2. Our expenses have fluctuated significantly over the past five years, due to seasonal and unexpected factors. We observed that our expenses tend to spike in the months of December and January, due to the holiday season and the winter heating costs. We also noticed that our expenses have increased in the last two years, due to some major life events, such as buying a new car, renovating our house, and having a baby. These factors have impacted our budget balance and our ability to save and invest. Therefore, we should review our spending habits and prioritize our needs and wants. We should also create a realistic and flexible budget that can accommodate our changing needs and circumstances.\n3. Our savings rate has improved over time, but we still need to work on reducing our debt and increasing our emergency fund. We found that our savings rate has increased from 10% to 15% of our income over the past five years, which is above the average savings rate of 8.8% in the US. This shows that we have been disciplined and consistent in saving and investing our money. However, we also found that our debt-to-income ratio has increased from 25% to 35% over the same period, which is above the recommended ratio of 20% or less. This means that we are spending more than we can afford on debt payments, which can affect our credit score and our financial security. Therefore, we should pay off our high-interest debt as soon as possible and avoid taking on new debt. We should also increase our emergency fund to cover at least six months of our living expenses, in case of any unforeseen events or emergencies.\"\n- Use visual aids to support your summary. Visual aids, such as charts, graphs, tables, and diagrams, can help you present your budget data and findings in a clear and engaging way. They can also help you highlight the trends, patterns, and outliers in your budget data, and compare and contrast your budget performance and projections. You should use visual aids that are appropriate for your budget data and analysis, and that can convey your message effectively. For example, you could use a line chart to show the changes in your income and expenses over time, a pie chart to show the distribution of your expenses by category, or a bar chart to show the comparison of your budget performance and projections by month or year. You should also label your visual aids properly and provide a brief explanation or interpretation of what they show. For example, you could say: \"The following line chart shows the changes in our income and expenses over the past five years. As you can see, our income has increased steadily, while our expenses have fluctuated significantly. The gap between our income and expenses represents our budget surplus or deficit, which indicates our budget balance and our ability to save and invest.\"\n```markdown\n![Line chart of income and expenses over time](line_chart.\n6. How to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis?\nData and Information\nOne of the most important aspects of writing a budget trend analysis is to properly cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your analysis.

Ocean heat waves are phenomena in which ocean temperatures increase rapidly over a period of several days to several years. The frequency of their occurrence has increased significantly over the past 100 years, and may have been a factor in the expansion of the red tide along the Pacific coast of Hokkaido in September 2021. Long-term weakening of the southward migration of the Oyashio Current and increase in bottom water temperature in the northern Pacific Ocean of Honshu (main island of

It influences climate and weather around the world and is home to millions of different forms of life.1 Thriving marine ecosystems provide Americans with food, medicines, jobs, and recreation. The ocean also connects people to nature and is critical to some Native cultures.\nCoral bleaching. Coral reefs are home to many sea creatures. When water is too warm or too cold, coral becomes damaged in a process called bleaching. If bleaching goes on for too long, it can kill the coral.39\nDead Zones. Harmful algal blooms (HABs), sometimes called red tides, have been linked to increasing temperatures in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Some species of HABs can produce excessive amounts of biomass that can prevent light from getting below the ocean surface. As these organisms die and decompose, oxygen levels go down, making it harder for other organisms to survive. Other species of HABs can produce toxins that are hazardous to marine life and humans.\nThreats to subsistence fishing. Salmon and other types of fish are an essential part of subsistence fishing in Alaska. Climate change is making it difficult for Indigenous people to practice fishing traditions.\nWildlife impacts. A 2014 marine heatwave caused the death of many sea lions.35 The warm water caused the fish that the sea lions eat to move elsewhere. As a result, thousands of sea lion pups starved.\nDecreases in commercial fishing harvests. America\u2019s East Coast is projected to see a 20% to 30% decrease in fish harvests by 2060.36 Climate change will drive fish further north as waters heat up.\nIncreasing emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels are causing changes in the ocean (see box). These changes can alter which species of marine life thrive best in certain areas. For example, many fish have shifted their typical range as water temperatures rise.2 However, other species are expected to decline in number or leave areas that are no longer favorable for them.3 These shifts can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and on fishing communities.4\nMany climate change impacts will only be avoided by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.5 Climate-driven changes in the ocean are motivating people to find solutions to the new challenges. For example, new forecast tools are helping predict changes in ocean conditions that can help the fishing industry adapt. Many organizations are working together to protect coral reefs, which face hazards such as bleaching, infectious diseases, smothering from sediment, collapses in fish stocks, and other issues. Such strategies can help preserve and protect marine resources. Even with these efforts, however, it will take decades or longer for the ocean to recover.\nExplore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on the ocean and marine resources:\nClimate Change Impacts on the Ocean\nHuman-caused carbon dioxide emissions are affecting the ocean in three main ways:\nTop Climate Impacts on the Ocean and Marine Resources\nClimate change affects the ocean in many ways. Three key impacts are described in this section.\n1. Changes in Ocean Ecosystems\nClimate changes to the physical and chemical makeup of the ocean have significant impacts on marine ecosystems. For example, water temperature influences which species can live in an area. Acidification affects many animals\u2019 ability to make shells or skeletons, while low oxygen levels can contribute to hypoxia, or dead zones. Warm temperatures can exacerbate the effects of both acidification and hypoxia.6\nImpacts on one species can ripple across an entire ecosystem. For example, plankton\u2014tiny organisms at the bottoms of many marine food chains\u2014are sensitive to water temperatures and oxygen concentrations. They can die off if the water gets too warm. Animals farther up the food chain, like whales, can suffer food shortages when this happens.\nClimate changes to the marine environment will come in many forms. For instance, the diversity of some temperate ecosystems is expected to increase.7 But overall, climate change is projected to disrupt marine ecosystems in ways that reduce the services they provide and their diversity of life.8\n2. More Common and Severe Extreme Marine Events\nRising water temperatures, acidification, and low oxygen levels can combine with natural ocean cycles to create extreme marine events. Marine heat waves, dead zones, and coral bleaching are just a few examples of these events, which are projected to become more common and severe.10 Extreme events can harm marine ecosystems and communities connected to these systems. For example, a large heat wave off the West Coast in 2014 shut down crab fisheries and starved baby sea lions.11\n3. Impacts on Marine Fisheries\nCommercial and recreational marine fisheries in some regions are at high risk from climate-driven changes in the size and distribution of fish populations.12 Some fish species have already altered their geographic range in response to climate change. For example, pollock and cod are moving north to colder water as local ocean temperatures rise.13\nThe movement of fish into new areas disrupts the ecosystems that they move into. It can also cause confusion about what fishing regulations apply.14 Changes in where fish live may also mean boats have to travel further from ports, potentially increasing costs.15\nClimate change is also affecting the timing of seasonal events, which can affect fisheries. For example, some species, such as striped bass, are spawning earlier in the year.16 This means that catches can peak earlier than normal. Fisheries will need to adapt to such changes or risk reduced catches and lost revenues, which can also increase prices for consumers.17\nChanges in the locations and number of fish species in the ocean can present new opportunities in some cases. For example, scientists predict that some areas, such as the Bering Sea, will see more kinds of fish as warming waters drive populations north.18 This could lead to new fishing opportunities and economic growth in that region.\nFor more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate Assessment.\nThe Marine Environment and the Economy\nMany U.S. industries depend on the ocean. The marine economy generated over $665 billion in sales in 2019, with tourism and recreation, including recreational fishing, making up more than one-third of that total.20 The marine economy also generated $397 billion in gross domestic product (GDP), which was 1.9% of the national GDP.21\nCommercial fisheries are an important contributor to the economy. In 2019, they produced 9.3 billion pounds of seafood valued at $5.5 billion.22 Other businesses, such as grocery stores, tackle shops, and restaurants, also benefit from fishery-related products and services.\nAs of 2019, almost 2.4 million Americans had jobs related to the ocean in fields including fisheries, construction, tourism, real estate, food service, and transportation.23 The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are both key trade channels for importing and exporting goods.24 The United States also extracts oil, gas, sand, and gravel from the ocean.\nThe ocean also provides many benefits that are harder to measure in economic terms. These are called ecosystem services. Carbon storage, water filtration, and shoreline protection are just a few of the many ecosystem services that the ocean provides.\nEnvironmental Justice and Equity\nHealthy oceans provide Americans with food and employment and are important to cultural traditions. Climate change leaves communities that depend on the ocean vulnerable to hardship. Many fishing communities already experience high rates of poverty.25 Unstable fish populations and market pricing can hurt fishing communities\u2019 earnings.26 This is especially true if a community depends on a single species for their livelihoods.\nOcean health is a cornerstone of many Indigenous cultures. Native American, Pacific Islander, and Alaska Native communities often practice subsistence fishing.27,28 Fluctuating fish populations can lead to food insecurity for rural Alaskan villages, where many people depend on locally caught fish for a large portion of their diet.29 For example, populations of Chinook and chum salmon hit record lows in 2021, leading to the closure of subsistence salmon fishing for much of the year.30 The number of shellfish, another important part of subsistence diets, has also been declining due to ocean acidification.31\nClimate change also affects Indigenous people culturally. Gathering and preparing food provide social, spiritual, and economic benefits for Indigenous communities.32,33 Disruptions to subsistence practices have negative health outcomes such as anxiety disorders and feelings of isolation.34\nWhat We Can Do\nWe can help reduce the impact of climate change on the marine environment in many ways, including the following:\nSee additional actions you can take, as well as steps that companies can take, on EPA\u2019s What You Can Do About Climate Change page.\nRelated Resources\nRelated Climate Indicators\nLearn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA\u2019s Climate Change Indicators in the United States:\nEndnotes\n1\u00a0National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

      "How to Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity: Key Methods for Accurate Bed Utilization\nTo calculate hospital bed capacity, use the formula: (Inpatient Days of Care / Bed Days Available) x 100. This formula determines the occupancy rate, providing valuable insights into bed utilization. The occupancy rate is normally calculated for specific periods such as a month or a year.\nSecond, the bed occupancy rate (BOR) method assesses the ratio of occupied beds to available beds, expressed as a percentage. To calculate BOR, divide the number of occupied beds by the total number of beds and multiply by 100. This method effectively highlights the efficiency of bed usage within a hospital.\nThird, the turnover interval (TI) method, which measures the time between a bed becoming vacant and being filled by the next patient, helps in understanding bed availability and throughput. A shorter turnover interval indicates higher efficiency.\nFourth, the bed manager\u2019s tool (BMT) involves real-time tracking software that updates bed status and predicts future occupancy trends. This dynamic approach allows for better resource allocation and immediate response to capacity issues.\nAccurately assessing hospital bed capacity ensures optimal resource use and improved patient care.\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll explore the impact of accurate bed utilization on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Understanding these effects can guide strategic decisions in health care management.\nWhat You Will Learn?\nWhat is Hospital Bed Capacity and Why Does It Matter?\nHospital bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care within a healthcare facility. This term encompasses both general and specialized beds, including those for intensive care and other critical needs.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital capacity is a key component in assessing healthcare system functionality and responsiveness. The WHO emphasizes the need for adequate hospital bed capacity to ensure quality patient care.\nHospital bed capacity includes several aspects, such as the physical space, staff availability, and the types of services offered. It directly affects patient wait times, treatment outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also notes that bed capacity is crucial for managing public health emergencies and planning healthcare resources effectively. They define it as an essential metric for healthcare quality and operational management.\nSeveral factors influence hospital bed capacity. These factors include population demographics, disease prevalence, public health initiatives, and hospital financing. Resource allocation and administrative strategies also play significant roles.\nIn the United States, as of 2022, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available, according to the American Hospital Association. Projections suggest that this number may not meet increasing healthcare demands in the coming years due to an aging population.\nLimited hospital bed capacity can lead to overcrowding, longer wait times, and compromised patient care. These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented increased hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses during winter months, affecting capacity planning.\nStaffing Levels: Staffing levels influence bed capacity since sufficient healthcare workers are necessary for proper patient care. Staffing shortages can lead to restricted bed availability, particularly in critical care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals with adequate staffing ratios can provide better care and manage capacity effectively.\nLocal Health Care Regulations: Local health care regulations can impact bed capacity and hospital operations. Regulations may dictate minimum staffing levels, licensing requirements, or limits on bed expansion. An understanding of local laws is essential for accurate capacity calculations. The Joint Commission outlines regulations that must be followed to maintain operational compliance and patient safety.\nBy considering these factors, hospitals can more accurately calculate their bed capacity and ensure they meet the needs of their communities effectively.\nWhich Types of Beds Are Included in Hospital Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospital bed capacity calculations typically include several types of beds. The main types are as follows:1. Acute Care Beds2. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds3. Rehabilitation Beds4. Long-Term Care Beds5. Observation Beds\nAcute Care Beds: Acute care beds are essential for patients who require immediate medical treatment. These beds accommodate individuals with severe health conditions or those recovering from surgeries. According to the American Hospital Association, acute care represents the majority of inpatient services, highlighting the importance of these beds in a hospital\u2019s capacity. An example is a post-operative patient who stays overnight for monitoring.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients. These beds feature advanced medical equipment and constant monitoring. The ratio of ICU beds varies worldwide, with a study in Europe showing an average of 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population. For example, a patient with severe respiratory failure may require an ICU bed for specialized care.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients.

For example, a patient with severe respiratory failure may require an ICU bed for specialized care.\nRehabilitation Beds: Rehabilitation beds are designated for patients who need recovery support after illness or surgery. These facilities focus on physical, occupational, and speech therapy. The World Health Organization notes an increasing demand for rehabilitation services as populations age. An example is a stroke patient receiving therapy to regain movement and speech.\nRehabilitation Beds: Rehabilitation beds are designated for patients who need recovery support after illness or surgery. These facilities focus on physical, occupational, and speech therapy. The World Health Organization notes an increasing demand for rehabilitation services as populations age. An example is a stroke patient receiving therapy to regain movement and speech.\nLong-Term Care Beds: Long-term care beds serve patients with chronic illnesses or disabilities requiring extended assistance. These facilities focus on maintaining the quality of life for residents. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, long-term care is crucial as the aging population grows. Residents often include elderly individuals or those with significant health challenges.\nLong-Term Care Beds: Long-term care beds serve patients with chronic illnesses or disabilities requiring extended assistance. These facilities focus on maintaining the quality of life for residents. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, long-term care is crucial as the aging population grows. Residents often include elderly individuals or those with significant health challenges.\nObservation Beds: Observation beds are utilized for patients who require monitoring but do not need full admission. These beds are typically for patients requiring short-term assessment or treatment, such as those with transient symptoms. The average observation stay is about 24 hours, making it an essential component of hospital capacity planning.\nObservation Beds: Observation beds are utilized for patients who require monitoring but do not need full admission. These beds are typically for patients requiring short-term assessment or treatment, such as those with transient symptoms. The average observation stay is about 24 hours, making it an essential component of hospital capacity planning.\nIn summary, hospital bed capacity includes various types of beds, each fulfilling unique roles in patient care and recovery. Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

Bed turnover rate is the average number of patients treated per bed during a specific time frame, typically over a day. A higher turnover rate indicates that beds are being used more frequently, which suggests a greater capacity for patient care.\nTo calculate bed capacity accurately, consider the following components:\nUnderstanding Bed Capacity: Bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care in a facility.\nCalculating Turnover Rate: Determine the bed turnover rate by dividing the total number of patient discharges by the number of available beds over a given period. This calculation provides insight into the utilization level.\nAdjusting Capacity Calculations: Incorporate the bed turnover rate into your bed capacity calculations. If the turnover rate is high, it implies that the facility can manage more patients in the same number of beds, indicating a need for higher capacity assessments.\nAnalyzing Operational Efficiency: A higher bed turnover rate may reflect operational efficiency and effective management of patient flow. This efficiency can lead to adjustments in staffing, resources, and space requirements, impacting overall capacity planning.\nForecasting Future Needs: Understanding the bed turnover rate helps in forecasting future bed requirements based on expected patient volumes. If the rate is consistent or increasing, the facility may need to plan for additional beds to meet demand.\nIn summary, the bed turnover rate provides essential data for calculating bed capacity in healthcare facilities. It informs how many patients can realistically be accommodated based on current usage patterns, staffing levels, and future demand projections. A careful evaluation of this rate supports strategic planning and enhances patient care services.\nWhat Role Does Average Length of Stay (ALOS) Play in Bed Capacity?\nThe Average Length of Stay (ALOS) plays a crucial role in determining hospital bed capacity. ALOS refers to the average number of days a patient spends in a hospital. It directly influences how many patients a hospital can treat within a given timeframe.\nKey aspects of ALOS related to bed capacity include:\nBed Turnover Rate:The bed turnover rate measures how frequently a hospital bed is occupied by different patients over a specific period. The length of stay impacts this metric. A lower ALOS typically results in a higher bed turnover rate, allowing hospitals to treat more patients. A study by the American Hospital Association in 2021 highlighted that hospitals with a lower ALOS had a bed turnover rate that was 15% higher than those with a longer stay.\nResource Allocation:Resource allocation refers to how efficiently a hospital staff and supplies are distributed to meet patient needs. Shorter ALOS can lead to a more balanced distribution of resources. For example, a 2019 report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services indicated that hospitals with shorter ALOS were able to operate more cost-effectively while maintaining staff efficiency, resulting in better patient care outcomes.\nResource Allocation:Resource allocation refers to how efficiently a hospital staff and supplies are distributed to meet patient needs.

Hospitals must carefully manage ALOS to enhance efficiency while ensuring adequate patient care.\nIn summary, Average Length of Stay (ALOS) significantly impacts hospital bed capacity through its influence on turnover rates, resource allocation, patient flow, financial health, and care quality. Hospitals must carefully manage ALOS to enhance efficiency while ensuring adequate patient care.\nWhat Common Challenges Are Faced in Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves multiple common challenges, including variability in patient demand, inaccurate data reporting, physical constraints, and policy impacts.\nVariability in Patient Demand\nInaccurate Data Reporting\nPhysical Constraints\nPolicy Impacts\nVariability in Patient Demand: Variability in patient demand significantly impacts bed capacity calculations. Demand can fluctuate due to seasonal illnesses, pandemics, and local events. For instance, during flu season, hospitals may experience higher patient volumes than usual. A study by the American Hospital Association (AHA) in 2020 noted that hospitals often face sudden surges in patient intake, complicating their capacity planning.\nInaccurate Data Reporting: Inaccurate data reporting can lead to miscalculations of bed availability. Hospitals may underreport or overreport bed occupancy rates. A survey by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) indicated that discrepancies in data can stem from software issues, human error, or inconsistent definitions of what constitutes a \u2018bed\u2019. These inaccuracies can hinder effective resource allocation.\nPhysical Constraints: Physical constraints, such as hospital layout and infrastructure, affect bed capacity. Space limitations and outdated facilities may reduce the number of operational beds. A case study on a hospital in rural Michigan found that limited physical space constrained bed expansion despite increasing demand. This situation highlights the importance of infrastructure assessment in capacity calculations.\nPolicy Impacts: Policy impacts also play a role in bed capacity challenges. Regulations regarding staffing ratios and safety standards can dictate how many beds can be operational. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) imposes certain regulations that may limit bed capacity based on staffing availability. This can create discrepancies between actual and theoretically available capacity.\nUnderstanding these challenges can improve hospital management and enhance patient care during critical times.\nHow Can Hospitals Use Technology to Improve Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospitals can use technology to improve bed capacity calculations by employing data analytics, predictive modeling, real-time monitoring, and electronic health record integration.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

      "How to Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity: Key Methods for Accurate Bed Utilization\nTo calculate hospital bed capacity, use the formula: (Inpatient Days of Care / Bed Days Available) x 100. This formula determines the occupancy rate, providing valuable insights into bed utilization. The occupancy rate is normally calculated for specific periods such as a month or a year.\nSecond, the bed occupancy rate (BOR) method assesses the ratio of occupied beds to available beds, expressed as a percentage. To calculate BOR, divide the number of occupied beds by the total number of beds and multiply by 100. This method effectively highlights the efficiency of bed usage within a hospital.\nThird, the turnover interval (TI) method, which measures the time between a bed becoming vacant and being filled by the next patient, helps in understanding bed availability and throughput. A shorter turnover interval indicates higher efficiency.\nFourth, the bed manager\u2019s tool (BMT) involves real-time tracking software that updates bed status and predicts future occupancy trends. This dynamic approach allows for better resource allocation and immediate response to capacity issues.\nAccurately assessing hospital bed capacity ensures optimal resource use and improved patient care.\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll explore the impact of accurate bed utilization on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Understanding these effects can guide strategic decisions in health care management.\nWhat You Will Learn?\nWhat is Hospital Bed Capacity and Why Does It Matter?\nHospital bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care within a healthcare facility. This term encompasses both general and specialized beds, including those for intensive care and other critical needs.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital capacity is a key component in assessing healthcare system functionality and responsiveness. The WHO emphasizes the need for adequate hospital bed capacity to ensure quality patient care.\nHospital bed capacity includes several aspects, such as the physical space, staff availability, and the types of services offered. It directly affects patient wait times, treatment outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also notes that bed capacity is crucial for managing public health emergencies and planning healthcare resources effectively. They define it as an essential metric for healthcare quality and operational management.\nSeveral factors influence hospital bed capacity. These factors include population demographics, disease prevalence, public health initiatives, and hospital financing. Resource allocation and administrative strategies also play significant roles.\nIn the United States, as of 2022, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available, according to the American Hospital Association. Projections suggest that this number may not meet increasing healthcare demands in the coming years due to an aging population.\nLimited hospital bed capacity can lead to overcrowding, longer wait times, and compromised patient care. These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented increased hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses during winter months, affecting capacity planning.\nStaffing Levels: Staffing levels influence bed capacity since sufficient healthcare workers are necessary for proper patient care. Staffing shortages can lead to restricted bed availability, particularly in critical care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals with adequate staffing ratios can provide better care and manage capacity effectively.\nLocal Health Care Regulations: Local health care regulations can impact bed capacity and hospital operations. Regulations may dictate minimum staffing levels, licensing requirements, or limits on bed expansion. An understanding of local laws is essential for accurate capacity calculations. The Joint Commission outlines regulations that must be followed to maintain operational compliance and patient safety.\nBy considering these factors, hospitals can more accurately calculate their bed capacity and ensure they meet the needs of their communities effectively.\nWhich Types of Beds Are Included in Hospital Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospital bed capacity calculations typically include several types of beds. The main types are as follows:1. Acute Care Beds2. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds3. Rehabilitation Beds4. Long-Term Care Beds5. Observation Beds\nAcute Care Beds: Acute care beds are essential for patients who require immediate medical treatment. These beds accommodate individuals with severe health conditions or those recovering from surgeries. According to the American Hospital Association, acute care represents the majority of inpatient services, highlighting the importance of these beds in a hospital\u2019s capacity. An example is a post-operative patient who stays overnight for monitoring.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients. These beds feature advanced medical equipment and constant monitoring. The ratio of ICU beds varies worldwide, with a study in Europe showing an average of 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population. For example, a patient with severe respiratory failure may require an ICU bed for specialized care.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

Tsai (2022) found that hospitals with a high CMI often require a flexible bed capacity model to accommodate fluctuating demands, with periodic reviews essential to adjust bed allocations.\nThese methods collectively provide a comprehensive framework for accurately calculating hospital bed capacity, ensuring that healthcare facilities can meet patient needs while effectively managing resources.\nHow Does Bed Turnover Rate Affect Bed Capacity Calculations?\nBed turnover rate directly affects bed capacity calculations by influencing how quickly beds can be occupied and vacated. Bed turnover rate is the average number of patients treated per bed during a specific time frame, typically over a day. A higher turnover rate indicates that beds are being used more frequently, which suggests a greater capacity for patient care.\nTo calculate bed capacity accurately, consider the following components:\nUnderstanding Bed Capacity: Bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care in a facility.\nCalculating Turnover Rate: Determine the bed turnover rate by dividing the total number of patient discharges by the number of available beds over a given period. This calculation provides insight into the utilization level.\nAdjusting Capacity Calculations: Incorporate the bed turnover rate into your bed capacity calculations. If the turnover rate is high, it implies that the facility can manage more patients in the same number of beds, indicating a need for higher capacity assessments.\nAnalyzing Operational Efficiency: A higher bed turnover rate may reflect operational efficiency and effective management of patient flow. This efficiency can lead to adjustments in staffing, resources, and space requirements, impacting overall capacity planning.\nForecasting Future Needs: Understanding the bed turnover rate helps in forecasting future bed requirements based on expected patient volumes. If the rate is consistent or increasing, the facility may need to plan for additional beds to meet demand.\nIn summary, the bed turnover rate provides essential data for calculating bed capacity in healthcare facilities. It informs how many patients can realistically be accommodated based on current usage patterns, staffing levels, and future demand projections. A careful evaluation of this rate supports strategic planning and enhances patient care services.\nWhat Role Does Average Length of Stay (ALOS) Play in Bed Capacity?\nThe Average Length of Stay (ALOS) plays a crucial role in determining hospital bed capacity. ALOS refers to the average number of days a patient spends in a hospital. It directly influences how many patients a hospital can treat within a given timeframe.\nKey aspects of ALOS related to bed capacity include:\nBed Turnover Rate:The bed turnover rate measures how frequently a hospital bed is occupied by different patients over a specific period. The length of stay impacts this metric. A lower ALOS typically results in a higher bed turnover rate, allowing hospitals to treat more patients. A study by the American Hospital Association in 2021 highlighted that hospitals with a lower ALOS had a bed turnover rate that was 15% higher than those with a longer stay.\nResource Allocation:Resource allocation refers to how efficiently a hospital staff and supplies are distributed to meet patient needs. Shorter ALOS can lead to a more balanced distribution of resources. For example, a 2019 report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services indicated that hospitals with shorter ALOS were able to operate more cost-effectively while maintaining staff efficiency, resulting in better patient care outcomes.\nResource Allocation:Resource allocation refers to how efficiently a hospital staff and supplies are distributed to meet patient needs.

Demand can fluctuate due to seasonal illnesses, pandemics, and local events. For instance, during flu season, hospitals may experience higher patient volumes than usual. A study by the American Hospital Association (AHA) in 2020 noted that hospitals often face sudden surges in patient intake, complicating their capacity planning.\nInaccurate Data Reporting: Inaccurate data reporting can lead to miscalculations of bed availability. Hospitals may underreport or overreport bed occupancy rates. A survey by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) indicated that discrepancies in data can stem from software issues, human error, or inconsistent definitions of what constitutes a \u2018bed\u2019. These inaccuracies can hinder effective resource allocation.\nPhysical Constraints: Physical constraints, such as hospital layout and infrastructure, affect bed capacity. Space limitations and outdated facilities may reduce the number of operational beds. A case study on a hospital in rural Michigan found that limited physical space constrained bed expansion despite increasing demand. This situation highlights the importance of infrastructure assessment in capacity calculations.\nPolicy Impacts: Policy impacts also play a role in bed capacity challenges. Regulations regarding staffing ratios and safety standards can dictate how many beds can be operational. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) imposes certain regulations that may limit bed capacity based on staffing availability. This can create discrepancies between actual and theoretically available capacity.\nUnderstanding these challenges can improve hospital management and enhance patient care during critical times.\nHow Can Hospitals Use Technology to Improve Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospitals can use technology to improve bed capacity calculations by employing data analytics, predictive modeling, real-time monitoring, and electronic health record integration. These technologies help optimize bed usage and enhance patient care.\nData analytics: Hospitals can analyze historical data to identify patterns in patient admissions and discharges. A study by Johnson et al. (2020) demonstrated that hospitals using data analytics improved bed occupancy rates by 15%. This analysis helps in forecasting bed availability based on past trends, ensuring more efficient resource allocation.\nPredictive modeling: Hospitals can implement predictive algorithms to forecast future bed demand. For instance, a study by Smith and Lee (2021) found that predictive modeling reduced patient wait times by up to 25%. These models consider factors like seasonal illnesses or local events, allowing hospitals to proactively manage bed capacity.\nReal-time monitoring: Hospitals can install digital dashboards that monitor bed occupancy in real time. This technology provides staff with instant updates about available beds, which enhances coordination in admitting new patients. Kaplan (2022) highlighted that hospitals utilizing real-time monitoring improved patient flow and reduced bottlenecks.\nElectronic health record (EHR) integration: EHR systems can track patient status and treatment progression. Integration with bed management systems allows for streamlined communication between departments. Research by Williams et al. (2019) indicated that EHR integration increased bed turnover rates by approximately 20%, allowing hospitals to serve more patients effectively.\nBy leveraging these technological advancements, hospitals can enhance their bed capacity calculations, resulting in improved efficiency and patient outcomes.\nWhat Best Practices Should Hospitals Follow for Effective Bed Capacity Management?\nEffective bed capacity management is essential for hospitals to optimize resource use and improve patient care. Best practices for effective bed capacity management include proactive forecasting, effective communication, patient flow management, and utilization of technology.\nProactive Forecasting\nEffective Communication\nPatient Flow Management\nUtilization of Technology\nProactive Forecasting: Proactive forecasting involves predicting patient admission rates based on historical data and trends. Hospitals should analyze past admission rates, seasonal variations, and local health trends to anticipate future demands. According to a study by Tzeng et al. (2018), hospitals that engage in proactive forecasting can enhance bed availability by 20%. For example, during flu season, hospitals can anticipate a surge in admissions and prepare accordingly.\nEffective Communication: Effective communication among staff is crucial for bed capacity management. Clear communication helps staff members understand patient status, potential discharges, and the need for immediate care. A study conducted by McHugh et al. (2016) showed that hospitals with improved communication processes significantly reduced patient wait times and enhanced overall efficiency. Tools such as daily huddles can ensure that everyone on the care team is informed and coordinated.\nPatient Flow Management: Patient flow management focuses on optimizing the movement of patients through the hospital system. This practice involves streamlining admission, transfer, and discharge processes. Research by McGrath et al. (2017) found that utilizing patient flow management techniques can reduce average length of stay by 15%. Hospitals may implement strategies like discharge planning meetings and real-time tracking systems to streamline patient movement.\nUtilization of Technology: Utilization of technology is essential for effective bed capacity management. Hospitals can use electronic health records (EHRs) and bed management software to gain insights into bed utilization patterns. A recent report by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) highlighted that hospitals using advanced technological solutions reduce bed turnover time by more than 30%. For instance, predictive analytics can help hospitals foresee bed occupancy and adjust staffing and resources accordingly.\nBy adopting these best practices, hospitals can improve their bed capacity management, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and efficient resource use.\nRelated Post:\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\nComment\n Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n \n\n\nmenu\nHome\nAbout Us\nBlog\nContact\nCategory\nMattress BasicsTypesUsageFurniture CompatibilityHealth & SafetyMaintenanceTransport & DeliveryBrandsRecyclingBlog\n\u00a9 2024 SleepBloom.Com All Rights Reserved\nPrivacy Policy | Disclaimer\n"

      "How to Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity: Key Methods for Accurate Bed Utilization\nTo calculate hospital bed capacity, use the formula: (Inpatient Days of Care / Bed Days Available) x 100. This formula determines the occupancy rate, providing valuable insights into bed utilization. The occupancy rate is normally calculated for specific periods such as a month or a year.\nSecond, the bed occupancy rate (BOR) method assesses the ratio of occupied beds to available beds, expressed as a percentage. To calculate BOR, divide the number of occupied beds by the total number of beds and multiply by 100. This method effectively highlights the efficiency of bed usage within a hospital.\nThird, the turnover interval (TI) method, which measures the time between a bed becoming vacant and being filled by the next patient, helps in understanding bed availability and throughput. A shorter turnover interval indicates higher efficiency.\nFourth, the bed manager\u2019s tool (BMT) involves real-time tracking software that updates bed status and predicts future occupancy trends. This dynamic approach allows for better resource allocation and immediate response to capacity issues.\nAccurately assessing hospital bed capacity ensures optimal resource use and improved patient care.\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll explore the impact of accurate bed utilization on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Understanding these effects can guide strategic decisions in health care management.\nWhat You Will Learn?\nWhat is Hospital Bed Capacity and Why Does It Matter?\nHospital bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care within a healthcare facility. This term encompasses both general and specialized beds, including those for intensive care and other critical needs.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital capacity is a key component in assessing healthcare system functionality and responsiveness. The WHO emphasizes the need for adequate hospital bed capacity to ensure quality patient care.\nHospital bed capacity includes several aspects, such as the physical space, staff availability, and the types of services offered. It directly affects patient wait times, treatment outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also notes that bed capacity is crucial for managing public health emergencies and planning healthcare resources effectively. They define it as an essential metric for healthcare quality and operational management.\nSeveral factors influence hospital bed capacity. These factors include population demographics, disease prevalence, public health initiatives, and hospital financing. Resource allocation and administrative strategies also play significant roles.\nIn the United States, as of 2022, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available, according to the American Hospital Association. Projections suggest that this number may not meet increasing healthcare demands in the coming years due to an aging population.\nLimited hospital bed capacity can lead to overcrowding, longer wait times, and compromised patient care. These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented increased hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses during winter months, affecting capacity planning.\nStaffing Levels: Staffing levels influence bed capacity since sufficient healthcare workers are necessary for proper patient care. Staffing shortages can lead to restricted bed availability, particularly in critical care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals with adequate staffing ratios can provide better care and manage capacity effectively.\nLocal Health Care Regulations: Local health care regulations can impact bed capacity and hospital operations. Regulations may dictate minimum staffing levels, licensing requirements, or limits on bed expansion. An understanding of local laws is essential for accurate capacity calculations. The Joint Commission outlines regulations that must be followed to maintain operational compliance and patient safety.\nBy considering these factors, hospitals can more accurately calculate their bed capacity and ensure they meet the needs of their communities effectively.\nWhich Types of Beds Are Included in Hospital Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospital bed capacity calculations typically include several types of beds. The main types are as follows:1. Acute Care Beds2. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds3. Rehabilitation Beds4. Long-Term Care Beds5. Observation Beds\nAcute Care Beds: Acute care beds are essential for patients who require immediate medical treatment. These beds accommodate individuals with severe health conditions or those recovering from surgeries. According to the American Hospital Association, acute care represents the majority of inpatient services, highlighting the importance of these beds in a hospital\u2019s capacity. An example is a post-operative patient who stays overnight for monitoring.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients. These beds feature advanced medical equipment and constant monitoring. The ratio of ICU beds varies worldwide, with a study in Europe showing an average of 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

      "\n\t\t\tCalifornia\u2019s intensive care nightmare: Which hospitals are full?\t\t\nShare this:\nIn summary\nIn the worst-hit counties, some hospitals are sending critically ill patients to other counties. Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family. It\u2019s devastating to the nurses. It\u2019s devastating to the physicians. It\u2019s just not a normal thing we\u2019re used to doing. And it\u2019s so impersonal, for something that\u2019s so personal.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore that experience, he said, it wouldn\u2019t even register when he heard an ambulance siren.\u00a0\n\u201cNow when I hear an ambulance go by, I feel this heaviness in the pit of my stomach of like, \u2018Is that another coronavirus patient that\u2019s going to be going into the hospital?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m emotionally exhausted by it, even though we\u2019re just getting going.\u201d\u00a0\nCalMatters COVID-19 coverage, translation and distribution is supported by generous grants from the Penner Family Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation and the California Health Care Foundation.\nRead more from CalMatters\nText\nGet breaking news on your phone.\nDownload\nKeep up with the latest via our app.\nSubscribe\nReceive updates in your inbox.\nMaricela, Montrose\nFeatured CalMatters Member\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel BeckerWater Reporter \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Becker is a journalist reporting on California\u2019s complex water challenges and water policy issues for CalMatters.

      "L.A. County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day \u2014 breaking the previous record set Sunday \u2014 and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n\u201cI do think that we\u2019re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,\u201d L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week \u2014 breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n\u201cLike a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,\u201d Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county\u2019s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 \u2014 the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state\u2019s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state\u2019s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients \u2014 by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but \u201cat a certain point, you run out of options, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d Simon said. \n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that\u2019s beyond a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we can\u2019t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.\u201d\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated \u201cthan just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,\u201d said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, \u201cthey make a downward adjustment \u2014 sort of, you get a penalty.\u201d\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: \u201cIf a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.\u201d\n\u201cThe ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,\u201d the department statement continued. \u201cIf a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.\u201d\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region\u2019s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That\u2019s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we\u2019re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,\u201d Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that\u2019s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders \u2014 which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining \u2014 are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n\u201cTo be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,\u201d San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. \u201cBut our window is narrowing and closing fast.\u201d\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n\u201cVaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA authorization will mean that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.\u201d\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that \u201cthe worst is not yet behind us.\u201d\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n \u2018A huge burden\u2019: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

      "\n\t\t\tCalifornia\u2019s intensive care nightmare: Which hospitals are full?\t\t\nShare this:\nIn summary\nIn the worst-hit counties, some hospitals are sending critically ill patients to other counties. Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family. It\u2019s devastating to the nurses. It\u2019s devastating to the physicians. It\u2019s just not a normal thing we\u2019re used to doing. And it\u2019s so impersonal, for something that\u2019s so personal.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore that experience, he said, it wouldn\u2019t even register when he heard an ambulance siren.\u00a0\n\u201cNow when I hear an ambulance go by, I feel this heaviness in the pit of my stomach of like, \u2018Is that another coronavirus patient that\u2019s going to be going into the hospital?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m emotionally exhausted by it, even though we\u2019re just getting going.\u201d\u00a0\nCalMatters COVID-19 coverage, translation and distribution is supported by generous grants from the Penner Family Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation and the California Health Care Foundation.\nRead more from CalMatters\nText\nGet breaking news on your phone.\nDownload\nKeep up with the latest via our app.\nSubscribe\nReceive updates in your inbox.\nMaricela, Montrose\nFeatured CalMatters Member\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel BeckerWater Reporter \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Becker is a journalist reporting on California\u2019s complex water challenges and water policy issues for CalMatters.

      "L.A. County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day \u2014 breaking the previous record set Sunday \u2014 and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n\u201cI do think that we\u2019re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,\u201d L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week \u2014 breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n\u201cLike a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,\u201d Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county\u2019s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 \u2014 the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state\u2019s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state\u2019s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients \u2014 by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but \u201cat a certain point, you run out of options, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d Simon said. \n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that\u2019s beyond a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we can\u2019t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.\u201d\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated \u201cthan just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,\u201d said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, \u201cthey make a downward adjustment \u2014 sort of, you get a penalty.\u201d\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: \u201cIf a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.\u201d\n\u201cThe ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,\u201d the department statement continued. \u201cIf a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.\u201d\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region\u2019s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That\u2019s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we\u2019re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,\u201d Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that\u2019s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders \u2014 which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining \u2014 are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n\u201cTo be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,\u201d San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. \u201cBut our window is narrowing and closing fast.\u201d\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n\u201cVaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA authorization will mean that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.\u201d\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that \u201cthe worst is not yet behind us.\u201d\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n \u2018A huge burden\u2019: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

      "L.A. County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day \u2014 breaking the previous record set Sunday \u2014 and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n\u201cI do think that we\u2019re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,\u201d L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week \u2014 breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n\u201cLike a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,\u201d Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county\u2019s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 \u2014 the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state\u2019s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state\u2019s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients \u2014 by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but \u201cat a certain point, you run out of options, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d Simon said. \n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that\u2019s beyond a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we can\u2019t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.\u201d\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated \u201cthan just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,\u201d said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, \u201cthey make a downward adjustment \u2014 sort of, you get a penalty.\u201d\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: \u201cIf a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.\u201d\n\u201cThe ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,\u201d the department statement continued. \u201cIf a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.\u201d\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region\u2019s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That\u2019s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we\u2019re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,\u201d Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that\u2019s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders \u2014 which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining \u2014 are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n\u201cTo be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,\u201d San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. \u201cBut our window is narrowing and closing fast.\u201d\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n\u201cVaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA authorization will mean that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.\u201d\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that \u201cthe worst is not yet behind us.\u201d\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n \u2018A huge burden\u2019: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

Staying home and preventing coronavirus infections will help hospitals manage the influx of patients. As officials wait and hope for the stay-at-home order to tame the surge, they are anxiously tracking ICU capacity.\nAdvertisement\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about ICU capacity and why it\u2019s important at this stage of the pandemic.\nFive things you need to know about COVID-19\nUPDATED\u00a0Oct. 2, 2020 | 5:15 PM\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\nA lot of them are the same as symptoms of a cold or the flu: cough, sore throat, congestion or a runny nose, fatigue, muscle or body aches, fever or chills, and shortness of breath. A person with COVID-19 may also experience diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, or a new loss of taste or smell. In cases of serious illness, it can take time for symptoms to worsen.\nHow long does it take for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed to the coronavirus?\nThe first symptoms can appear in as few as two days, but it can also take as long as two weeks, according to the CDC. An incubation period of four or five days is more typical. However, a significant proportion of people who are infected \u2014 perhaps as much as 45% \u2014 never develop any symptoms, researchers say.\nWhat should I do if I think I'm infected?\nIf you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you\u2019ve been in close contact with someone who has it, the CDC recommends that you get a coronavirus test. Until you get your test results, you should assume you are infected. That means staying at home as much as possible so that you don\u2019t risk infecting others. Of course, if you\u2019re having a medical emergency, don\u2019t be afraid to call 911.  \nSome diagnostic tests look for genetic evidence of the virus in a sample of saliva or a specimen collected from the nose or throat. Others can detect specific coronavirus molecules that prompt the immune system to produce infection-fighting antibodies.\nHow can I reduce my risk of infection?\nLimit contact with people outside of your household. When you do go out, wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth and stay at least six feet away from others whenever possible. Clean your hands frequently by using soap and water for 20 seconds or a sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are dirty. At home, clean and disinfect tables, doorknobs, faucets and other frequently touched surfaces once a day.\nHow did the pandemic start?\nScientists think it began with a close relative of the novel coronavirus that has been circulating in bats and other animals for so long that it no longer makes them sick. That virus must have gained a key mutation that allowed it to infect humans. Health officials in China reported the first cases of the respiratory illness that came to be known as COVID-19 in December 2019. The first known case in Los Angeles was in January. California has had more than 800,000 confirmed cases since.\nWhat is an ICU?\nAn ICU, or intensive care unit, is a specialized hospital department that cares for people in the most critical health situations, such as those with life-threatening injuries or severe illnesses. ICUs are equipped with specialized equipment, such as ventilators.\nMost important, ICUs are staffed with highly trained nurses and physicians who provide round-the-clock care to their patients \u2014 checking their breathing, blood pressure, fluids and other vital signs. Dr. Shruti Gohil, an infectious disease specialist at UCI Health, said there is a 1-to-1 ratio of nurses to patients in ICUs.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThat kind of minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour care requires a level of training on the nurses to ... recognize problems quickly and address them quickly and then know what needs to be done while waiting,\u201d Gohil said.\nA COVID-19 patient with severe difficulty breathing may require ventilator support in an ICU.\n\u201cWe are responding at the moment to a tsunami of COVID-19 patients in the hospital,\u201d said Carmela Coyle, president and chief executive of the California Hospital Assn. \u201cBut that does not stop the heart attacks, the strokes, the cancer patients with serious, immediate needs.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhat is ICU capacity?\nCapacity is the number of staffed beds available at a point in time.\nDetermining whether capacity has been reached is more nebulous.\nThe state determines a region\u2019s ICU capacity with a weighted formula to ensure that some ICU beds remain open for non-COVID patients. When the state says a region has reached 0%, it may actually still have some beds available. Individual counties, such as Fresno, have reported having no open ICU beds.\nCapacity also fluctuates as patients exit the ICU and others enter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always sort of this movement that\u2019s not always quite captured by the snapshots that we get,\u201d said Dr. Rais Vohra, interim health officer for Fresno County. \u201cOverall, the capacity is severely impacted.\u201d\nWhat happens when an ICU reaches 0% capacity?\nHospitals will likely place patients in open beds elsewhere in the hospital, such as emergency department rooms.\nHaving open beds in other parts of the hospital does not mean a hospital is equipped to handle more intensive care patients. Dr. Bill Stringer, chief pulmonologist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, said the \u201climiting step is not going to be space or equipment. It\u2019s going to be staff.\u201d\nBecause of their specialized training in high-intensity situations, ICU medical professionals are scarce resources.\n\nCalifornia\nHere\u2019s what the ICU ward looks like with 0% availability\nICU availability in Southern California at 0%, and the crisis is expected to get worse, officials warn.\nDec. 21, 2020\n\u201cThe problem is, we\u2019ve got a nationwide shortage of critical care nurses,\u201d Coyle said. \u201cIt is not the case where you can pull any nurse into the ICU to provide that level of care.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAnd when ICUs are stretched beyond capacity, the quality of care can decline and mortality rates can rise.\nAs ICU capacity shrinks, a hospital is likely to scale back elective procedures, freeing up staff. Some healthcare workers \u2014 such as those who work in trauma, surgery and anesthesia \u2014 are already trained for high-stress scenarios, so they would be \u201cnatural pivots\u201d to the ICU, Gohil said. A critical care professional would supervise.\n\u201cIn a poor, catastrophic state, it would be an all-hands-on-deck approach,\u201d Gohil said.\nIf a hospital\u2019s beds fill, some patients may be transferred to neighboring hospitals. But moving ICU patients is risky, Stringer said.\n\u201cJust imagine somebody who is just completely inert, that is sedated, that is being supported at least with a ventilator,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most fragile and vulnerable patient being transferred. That\u2019s a very difficult decision.\u201d\nHow do I find out the ICU capacity where I live?\nThe state keeps an updated list of ICU bed availability by county.\nHospitals report their capacities daily, and the state tallies them.\nHere are the regional numbers as of Thursday afternoon:\n\nSouthern California: 7.7%, down from 9% Wednesday\nSan Joaquin Valley: 1.9%, down from 4.2%\nGreater Sacramento: 13.3%, down from 14.3%\nBay Area: 17.8%, down from 20.9%\nNorthern California: 30.3%, an improvement from 27.1%\n\nI live in a region where ICU space is at capacity, but I have a medical emergency. What do I do?\nYou should still seek help. If you\u2019re in a serious emergency, call 911.\nAdvertisement\nOtherwise, Stringer said, call the hospital emergency departments near you to check their capacity. Then wear a mask and go.\n\u201cThe hospital, even though we have plenty of COVID patients, is still a safe place to get care,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not as safe as being on a backpacking trip in the Rockies. But if you\u2019ve got an emergency, you need to call.\u201d\nMore to Read\n\n\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new coronavirus wave is disrupting lives, even with less severe illness\nJune 1, 2022\n*    \nAnother bummer coronavirus summer for California?

      "\n\t\t1 Chicago Hospital Given \u2018F' Grade, 7 Others in Illinois Get a \u2018D' in New Safety Report\t\n\n\t\t\tThe latest rankings from the Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit watchdog, analyzed nearly 3,000 general hospitals in the U.S. based on protection from things like medical errors, accidents, injuries, and infections\t\t\nA new hospital safety report has graded more than 100 hospitals in Illinois, leaving just one Chicago hospital with an \"F\" and seven others with a \"D\" grade. \nThe latest rankings from the Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit watchdog, analyzed nearly 3,000 general hospitals in the U.S. based on protection from things like medical errors, accidents, injuries and infections.\n\ud83d\udcfa 24/7 Chicago news stream: Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are\nIn Illinois, 113 hospitals were rated, with 30 hospitals receiving \"A\" grades, 25 scoring \"B\" grades and 50 others getting \"C\" grades. Seven state hospitals were given \"D\" grades and one hospital earned an \"F\" rating. \nHospitals are ranked based on the number of infections, problems with surgeries, safety issues, staffing and measures aimed at preventing errors. \nThe \"F\" was given to South Shore Hospital in Chicago. \nThe hospital did not respond to NBC Chicago's requests, but was given low marks in some infection categories, hospital falls, error prevention strategies, and staffing and communication. \nSouth Shore CEO Leslie Rogers told the Chicago Tribune after stepping into a leadership role this summer, that the not-for-profit hospital was striving to have a \"C\" or better in the next ranking.\nLocal\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman shot and killed in northwest suburbs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's what changes are coming to Social Security in 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMeanwhile, more than half a dozen other facilities got \"D\" grades on the list. \nThat includes Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Gateway Regional Medical Center in Granite City, Javon Bae Hospital in Rockford, Roseland Community Hospital in Chicago, Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center in Mattoon, Vista Medical Center East in Waukegan and Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. \nWeiss Hospital told NBC Chicago in a statement that its low ranking was \"due to an increase in hospital acquired infections\" during earlier reporting periods. \n\"Since then, we have improved our processes and expect future scores, specifically Fall, to reflect those improvements,\" a spokesperson said. \"Patient safety is our highest priority, and our physicians and staff are fully committed to quality in our patient care activities.\" \nVista Health System said it \"improved during this rating period and continuously focuses on safety, quality, and our patients\u2019 experience\" but noted that data used in its grade \"is more than three years old in some cases and does not reflect the dedication and clinical performance of Vista\u2019s physicians, nurses, and staff.\"\n\"Several national and state agencies acknowledge Vista\u2019s commitment to quality and safety, including U.S. News and World Report, which recently recognized Vista as a high-performing hospital in stroke and COPD care for 2022-2023, and the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, which recognized Vista with a 'Get with The Guidelines Stroke Gold Plus' achievement award with Target: Type 2 Diabetes Honor Roll,\" the healthcare company said. \nAdvocate Aurora Health said it has a \"robust plan in place to drive continued improvement in both safety and health outcomes for our patients.\"\n\"We firmly believe that meaningful quality and safety data should be transparent to the public. However, accurately measuring this data can be challenging, and some organizations use limited methodologies that don\u2019t always reflect the quality of care or the varied factors that contribute to patient outcomes,\" the hospital system said in a statement.\nNBC Chicago reached out to a number of other hospitals listed in the ranking but did not receive a response. \nSome prominent Chicago-area hospitals were also among the \"C\" ratings on the list, including Northwestern Medicine's Lake Forest Hospital, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System, a number of OSF HealthCare facilities, Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and more.  \nNorthwestern Medicine said its Lake Forest Hospital \"is committed to providing high quality, safe, patient-centered care.\" \n\"Our physicians, nurses and staff are driven by their dedication and passion for delivering outstanding care while always striving to do what is better for our patients,\" the hospital said in a statement. \"We believe that quality and safety data should be meaningful, informative and transparent to the public. We appreciate the ongoing efforts by\u00a0Leapfrog\u00a0to improve the usefulness and accessibility of information for consumers.\"\nOSF HealthCare said 10 of its 15 hospitals received a grade in the report, one of which was given an A and five others given B's. \nIn total, four were given a C rating. \n\u201cOSF supports transparency about quality and safety information such as that provided through the Leapfrog grades and is committed to finding ways to improve safety and quality of care. We are proud of the work our Mission Partners (employees) do every day and how they have faced the many challenges of the past two years,\" the healthcare company said in a statement. \nIllinois ranked 28th in the U.S., with 26.5% of hospitals getting an \"A\" grade in the bi-annual report. In the spring, the state was listed at 27th. \nStill, in the fall of 2021, only 18 state hospitals were listed with an \"A\" grade. \nThe top-ranked state on the list was New Hampshire, followed by Virginia, Utah, Colorado and Idaho. \nHere's a look at which Illinois hospitals received an \"A\" grade: \nAdventHealth Bolingbrook - Bolingbrook, IL \nAdventHealth GlenOaks - Glendale Heights, IL\nAdventHealth Hinsdale - Hinsdale, IL \nAdventHealth La Grange - La Grange, IL\nAscension Mercy - Aurora, IL\nAscension Resurrection - Chicago, IL\nBlessing Hospital - Quincy, IL\nCarle Foundation Hospital- Urbana, IL \nElmhurst Memorial Hospital - Elmhurst, IL\nFHN Memorial Hospital - Freeport, IL\nHSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital - O'Fallon, IL\nLoyola Gottlieb Memorial Hospital - Melrose Park, IL \nMacNeal Hospital - Berwyn, IL \nMcDonough District Hospital - Macomb, IL \nMemorial Hospital Belleville - Belleville, IL \nMorris Hospital - Morris, IL \nNorthwest Community Hospital - Arlington Heights, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital - Winfield, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital - Geneva, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Huntley Hospital - Huntley, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Hospital - DeKalb, IL\nNorthwestern Medicine McHenry Hospital - McHenry, IL\nOSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center - Peoria, IL \nRush Copley Medical Center - Aurora, IL\nRush Oak Park Hospital520 - Oak Park, IL \nRush University Medical Center - Chicago, IL \nSilver Cross Hospital - New Lenox, IL \nSSM Health St. Mary's Hospital-Centralia - Centralia, IL \nUnityPoint Health - Proctor - Peoria, IL \nUniversity of Chicago Medical Center - Chicago, IL\nSee the full list of hospital grades in Illinois here. \nTrending Stories\nWeather Forecast\n"

Seven state hospitals were given \"D\" grades and one hospital earned an \"F\" rating. \nHospitals are ranked based on the number of infections, problems with surgeries, safety issues, staffing and measures aimed at preventing errors. \nThe \"F\" was given to South Shore Hospital in Chicago. \nThe hospital did not respond to NBC Chicago's requests, but was given low marks in some infection categories, hospital falls, error prevention strategies, and staffing and communication. \nSouth Shore CEO Leslie Rogers told the Chicago Tribune after stepping into a leadership role this summer, that the not-for-profit hospital was striving to have a \"C\" or better in the next ranking.\nLocal\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman shot and killed in northwest suburbs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's what changes are coming to Social Security in 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMeanwhile, more than half a dozen other facilities got \"D\" grades on the list. \nThat includes Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Gateway Regional Medical Center in Granite City, Javon Bae Hospital in Rockford, Roseland Community Hospital in Chicago, Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center in Mattoon, Vista Medical Center East in Waukegan and Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. \nWeiss Hospital told NBC Chicago in a statement that its low ranking was \"due to an increase in hospital acquired infections\" during earlier reporting periods. \n\"Since then, we have improved our processes and expect future scores, specifically Fall, to reflect those improvements,\" a spokesperson said. \"Patient safety is our highest priority, and our physicians and staff are fully committed to quality in our patient care activities.\" \nVista Health System said it \"improved during this rating period and continuously focuses on safety, quality, and our patients\u2019 experience\" but noted that data used in its grade \"is more than three years old in some cases and does not reflect the dedication and clinical performance of Vista\u2019s physicians, nurses, and staff.\"\n\"Several national and state agencies acknowledge Vista\u2019s commitment to quality and safety, including U.S. News and World Report, which recently recognized Vista as a high-performing hospital in stroke and COPD care for 2022-2023, and the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, which recognized Vista with a 'Get with The Guidelines Stroke Gold Plus' achievement award with Target: Type 2 Diabetes Honor Roll,\" the healthcare company said. \nAdvocate Aurora Health said it has a \"robust plan in place to drive continued improvement in both safety and health outcomes for our patients.\"\n\"We firmly believe that meaningful quality and safety data should be transparent to the public. However, accurately measuring this data can be challenging, and some organizations use limited methodologies that don\u2019t always reflect the quality of care or the varied factors that contribute to patient outcomes,\" the hospital system said in a statement.\nNBC Chicago reached out to a number of other hospitals listed in the ranking but did not receive a response. \nSome prominent Chicago-area hospitals were also among the \"C\" ratings on the list, including Northwestern Medicine's Lake Forest Hospital, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System, a number of OSF HealthCare facilities, Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and more.  \nNorthwestern Medicine said its Lake Forest Hospital \"is committed to providing high quality, safe, patient-centered care.\" \n\"Our physicians, nurses and staff are driven by their dedication and passion for delivering outstanding care while always striving to do what is better for our patients,\" the hospital said in a statement. \"We believe that quality and safety data should be meaningful, informative and transparent to the public. We appreciate the ongoing efforts by\u00a0Leapfrog\u00a0to improve the usefulness and accessibility of information for consumers.\"\nOSF HealthCare said 10 of its 15 hospitals received a grade in the report, one of which was given an A and five others given B's. \nIn total, four were given a C rating. \n\u201cOSF supports transparency about quality and safety information such as that provided through the Leapfrog grades and is committed to finding ways to improve safety and quality of care. We are proud of the work our Mission Partners (employees) do every day and how they have faced the many challenges of the past two years,\" the healthcare company said in a statement. \nIllinois ranked 28th in the U.S., with 26.5% of hospitals getting an \"A\" grade in the bi-annual report. In the spring, the state was listed at 27th. \nStill, in the fall of 2021, only 18 state hospitals were listed with an \"A\" grade. \nThe top-ranked state on the list was New Hampshire, followed by Virginia, Utah, Colorado and Idaho. \nHere's a look at which Illinois hospitals received an \"A\" grade: \nAdventHealth Bolingbrook - Bolingbrook, IL \nAdventHealth GlenOaks - Glendale Heights, IL\nAdventHealth Hinsdale - Hinsdale, IL \nAdventHealth La Grange - La Grange, IL\nAscension Mercy - Aurora, IL\nAscension Resurrection - Chicago, IL\nBlessing Hospital - Quincy, IL\nCarle Foundation Hospital- Urbana, IL \nElmhurst Memorial Hospital - Elmhurst, IL\nFHN Memorial Hospital - Freeport, IL\nHSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital - O'Fallon, IL\nLoyola Gottlieb Memorial Hospital - Melrose Park, IL \nMacNeal Hospital - Berwyn, IL \nMcDonough District Hospital - Macomb, IL \nMemorial Hospital Belleville - Belleville, IL \nMorris Hospital - Morris, IL \nNorthwest Community Hospital - Arlington Heights, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital - Winfield, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital - Geneva, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Huntley Hospital - Huntley, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Hospital - DeKalb, IL\nNorthwestern Medicine McHenry Hospital - McHenry, IL\nOSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center - Peoria, IL \nRush Copley Medical Center - Aurora, IL\nRush Oak Park Hospital520 - Oak Park, IL \nRush University Medical Center - Chicago, IL \nSilver Cross Hospital - New Lenox, IL \nSSM Health St. Mary's Hospital-Centralia - Centralia, IL \nUnityPoint Health - Proctor - Peoria, IL \nUniversity of Chicago Medical Center - Chicago, IL\nSee the full list of hospital grades in Illinois here. \nTrending Stories\nWeather Forecast\n"

Seven state hospitals were given \"D\" grades and one hospital earned an \"F\" rating. \nHospitals are ranked based on the number of infections, problems with surgeries, safety issues, staffing and measures aimed at preventing errors. \nThe \"F\" was given to South Shore Hospital in Chicago. \nThe hospital did not respond to NBC Chicago's requests, but was given low marks in some infection categories, hospital falls, error prevention strategies, and staffing and communication. \nSouth Shore CEO Leslie Rogers told the Chicago Tribune after stepping into a leadership role this summer, that the not-for-profit hospital was striving to have a \"C\" or better in the next ranking.\nLocal\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman shot and killed in northwest suburbs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's what changes are coming to Social Security in 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMeanwhile, more than half a dozen other facilities got \"D\" grades on the list. \nThat includes Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Gateway Regional Medical Center in Granite City, Javon Bae Hospital in Rockford, Roseland Community Hospital in Chicago, Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center in Mattoon, Vista Medical Center East in Waukegan and Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. \nWeiss Hospital told NBC Chicago in a statement that its low ranking was \"due to an increase in hospital acquired infections\" during earlier reporting periods. \n\"Since then, we have improved our processes and expect future scores, specifically Fall, to reflect those improvements,\" a spokesperson said. \"Patient safety is our highest priority, and our physicians and staff are fully committed to quality in our patient care activities.\" \nVista Health System said it \"improved during this rating period and continuously focuses on safety, quality, and our patients\u2019 experience\" but noted that data used in its grade \"is more than three years old in some cases and does not reflect the dedication and clinical performance of Vista\u2019s physicians, nurses, and staff.\"\n\"Several national and state agencies acknowledge Vista\u2019s commitment to quality and safety, including U.S. News and World Report, which recently recognized Vista as a high-performing hospital in stroke and COPD care for 2022-2023, and the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, which recognized Vista with a 'Get with The Guidelines Stroke Gold Plus' achievement award with Target: Type 2 Diabetes Honor Roll,\" the healthcare company said. \nAdvocate Aurora Health said it has a \"robust plan in place to drive continued improvement in both safety and health outcomes for our patients.\"\n\"We firmly believe that meaningful quality and safety data should be transparent to the public. However, accurately measuring this data can be challenging, and some organizations use limited methodologies that don\u2019t always reflect the quality of care or the varied factors that contribute to patient outcomes,\" the hospital system said in a statement.\nNBC Chicago reached out to a number of other hospitals listed in the ranking but did not receive a response. \nSome prominent Chicago-area hospitals were also among the \"C\" ratings on the list, including Northwestern Medicine's Lake Forest Hospital, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System, a number of OSF HealthCare facilities, Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and more.  \nNorthwestern Medicine said its Lake Forest Hospital \"is committed to providing high quality, safe, patient-centered care.\" \n\"Our physicians, nurses and staff are driven by their dedication and passion for delivering outstanding care while always striving to do what is better for our patients,\" the hospital said in a statement. \"We believe that quality and safety data should be meaningful, informative and transparent to the public. We appreciate the ongoing efforts by\u00a0Leapfrog\u00a0to improve the usefulness and accessibility of information for consumers.\"\nOSF HealthCare said 10 of its 15 hospitals received a grade in the report, one of which was given an A and five others given B's. \nIn total, four were given a C rating. \n\u201cOSF supports transparency about quality and safety information such as that provided through the Leapfrog grades and is committed to finding ways to improve safety and quality of care.

      "Open Access ISSN: 2573-0347 Advanced Practices in Nursing Mini Review Volume 09:03, 2024 Abstract The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. This review explores the relationship between nurse-patient ratios and various outcomes in healthcare settings, including patient morbidity and mortality, nurse job satisfaction, and overall care quality. By synthesizing current literature, the review highlights the impact of staffing levels on patient care and nurse well-being, and discusses potential strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to enhance healthcare delivery. This involves regular assessment of healthcare outcomes, patient satisfaction, and compliance with clinical guidelines. Healthcare organizations often use quality improvement methodologies, such as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles and Six Sigma, to identify areas for improvement, implement changes, and measure the impact of those changes. These methodologies provide a structured approach to problem-solving and facilitate the systematic improvement of healthcare processes.\nKeywords: Healthcare quality \u2022 Patient safety \u2022 Nurse job satisfaction \u2022 Healthcare delivery *Address for Correspondence: Christmal Dela, Department of Health Sciences, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa; E-mail: christmal.\nchristmals23@nwu.ac.za Copyright: \u00a9 2024 Dela C.

Adequate staffing levels ensure that nurses can provide thorough and attentive care, which is essential for positive patient outcomes. Conversely, inadequate nurse-patient ratios can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality, nurse burnout, and reduced quality of care. As healthcare systems globally grapple with resource constraints and increasing patient demands, understanding the impact of nurse-patient ratios is paramount for policy-making and healthcare management. This paper reviews existing literature on nurse-patient ratios, examining their influence on healthcare quality and patient safety. The goal is to identify the key outcomes associated with varying staffing levels and propose strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to improve healthcare delivery [1].\nLiterature Review Research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between nurse-patient ratios and patient outcomes. Studies have shown that lower nurse-patient ratios are associated with decreased patient morbidity and mortality. That improved nurse staffing levels significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers, and patient falls. Nurse Job satisfaction and retention are also influenced by nurse-patient ratios. High patient loads can lead to increased stress, burnout, and job dissatisfaction among nurses. This not only affects the well-being of nurses but also impacts patient care, as high turnover rates can disrupt continuity and quality of care. Healthcare quality, as measured by patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, is closely tied to nurse staffing levels. Hospitals with adequate nurse-patient ratios tend to have higher patient satisfaction scores, as patients receive more personalized and timely care. Additionally, better-staffed units often experience fewer medical errors and higher adherence to clinical guidelines [2].\nDiscussion Optimizing nurse-patient ratios is essential for enhancing healthcare quality and patient safety. Several strategies can be employed to achieve this goal. First, implementing mandated staffing ratios, as seen in California, where legislation requires specific nurse-to-patient ratios in hospitals, can ensure a baseline standard for staffing levels. Research indicates that these regulations have led to improved patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction. Second, employing flexible staffing models that adjust to patient acuity and census can help manage workload more effectively. Utilizing data-driven tools to predict patient needs and adjust staffing accordingly ensures that resources are allocated efficiently. Third, investing in nurse workforce development is crucial. Providing ongoing education, career development opportunities, and supportive work environments can enhance nurse retention and attract new entrants to the profession. This, in turn, can help maintain adequate staffing levels [3].\nFinally, leveraging technology to support nursing practice can alleviate some of the burdens associated with high patient loads. Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telehealth, and other digital tools can streamline documentation, facilitate communication, and enhance care coordination, allowing nurses to focus more on direct patient care. Healthcare quality and safety are fundamental aspects of healthcare delivery that ensure patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Quality in healthcare refers to the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes consistent with current professional knowledge. Safety, a crucial component of quality, involves minimizing risks, errors, and harm to patients during the provision of healthcare services. Together, healthcare quality and safety form the bedrock of effective medical practice and patient care. A key element of healthcare quality is the implementation of evidence-based practices. These practices are rooted in the best available scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values. By adhering to evidence-based guidelines, healthcare providers can ensure that the treatments and interventions they offer are both effective and efficient. For instance, the use of standardized protocols for managing chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension has been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications. Similarly, adherence to surgical checklists has been proven to significantly decrease surgical errors and infections [4].\nPatient safety initiatives aim to create a safe healthcare environment by preventing and reducing risks, errors, and harm that can occur during patient care. These initiatives encompass a range of strategies, including the development of safety protocols, the use of technology to prevent errors, and the promotion of a culture of safety within healthcare organizations. For example, the implementation of Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems has been instrumental in reducing medication errors by ensuring accurate and legible prescriptions. Additionally, the use of barcoding systems Adv Practice Nurs, Volume 09:03, 2024 Page 2 of 2 Dela C.\nfor medication administration ensures that patients receive the correct medications at the appropriate dosages. A critical aspect of healthcare quality and safety is the continuous monitoring and improvement of healthcare processes [5].\nAnother vital component of healthcare quality is patient-centered care. This approach involves respecting patients' preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that they guide all clinical decisions. Patient-centered care emphasizes the importance of effective communication, shared decision-making, and providing compassionate and respectful care. By involving patients in their care, healthcare providers can improve patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment plans, and overall health outcomes. Healthcare quality and safety are also influenced by the work environment and culture within healthcare organizations. A supportive work environment that promotes teamwork, open communication, and continuous learning is essential for ensuring high-quality and safe patient care. Organizations that prioritize staff well-being, provide ongoing education and training, and encourage reporting and learning from errors is better positioned to deliver safe and effective care. Moreover, regulatory bodies and accreditation organizations play a significant role in promoting healthcare quality and safety. These entities establish standards and guidelines that healthcare organizations must adhere to and conduct regular inspections and evaluations to ensure compliance. Accreditation by organizations such as The Joint Commission signifies that a healthcare facility meets high standards of care and safety [6]. Conclusion The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. Adequate staffing levels are associated with better patient outcomes, higher nurse job satisfaction, and overall improved healthcare delivery. By implementing mandated staffing ratios, employing flexible staffing models, investing in workforce development, and leveraging technology, healthcare organizations can optimize nurse-patient ratios to enhance patient care and nurse well-being. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, prioritizing adequate nurse staffing will remain essential for ensuring high-quality, safe, and effective patient care.\nAcknowledgement None.\nConflict of Interest None.\nHow to cite this article: Dela, Christmal. \u201cThe Impact of Nurse-patient Ratios on Healthcare Quality and Safety.\u201d Adv Practice Nurs 9 (2024): 387.\nReferences 1.

      "A Texas town is trying to solve the US physician shortage with 'homegrown' clinicians \u2014 a possible answer to the primary-care drought plaguing 100 million Americans\nEighteen-year-old Makena Pi\u00f1on had a first-hand view of the medical gaps in El Paso's healthcare system.\nBorn with a congenital heart defect, Pi\u00f1on underwent her first operation at 5 months old, followed by open-heart surgery at 11.\n\"El Paso is a very underserved community,\" she told Insider. \"Being a patient all my life in Houston and then having hospital visits here in El Paso, you can see the difference in the care and how advanced the medicine is,\" Pi\u00f1on said.\nThis year, Pi\u00f1on was one of five El Paso teenagers celebrating an unusual milestone for high-school seniors: She was effectively accepted into medical school, at least four years before most aspiring physicians find out whether they got in.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis nontraditional path to a white-coat ceremony is part of a new, local partnership that aims to combat its hometown's physician shortage with guaranteed spots in medical school, mentorship, Medical College Admission Test preparation, and summer internships. The hope is they will stay and practice medicine in El Paso after medical school and residency.\n\"I really hope to provide a perspective and knowledge to the community here and help to serve patients who might otherwise have to leave because there aren't as many doctors here and I'd like to slowly but surely help keep more patients here,\" Pi\u00f1on said.\nEl Paso County, which includes the city of the same name, is among the 95% of Texas counties that have a shortage of primary-care physicians. They're not alone \u2014 just shy of 100 million Americans live in an area with a shortage of primary-care physicians. And demand for medical care is growing as the American population ages, outstripping supply.\nThe shortages are especially dire in rural areas, where 20% of Americans live but only 10% of doctors practice. The program in Texas for high-school students is adding needed doctors to the primary-care-physician pipeline and could offer a model for other communities facing similar challenges.\nFederal funding could aid and expand the healthcare workforce, but it may not be enough to meet the demand among rural populations. One key to addressing the lack of physicians could be a \"homegrown\" approach to making \u2014 and keeping \u2014 more doctors, nurses, and other clinicians in the areas where they are needed most through mentorship opportunities and state- and privately funded scholarships.\nLimits to the industry's education system leave some medical students without jobs\u00a0\nThe number of students enrolled in medical school grew by 9% between 2010 and 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics \u2014 plus another 3% from 2021 to the 2022-23 academic year, according to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges. But the US is on track to have a shortage of around 48,200 to 73,700 doctors by 2024, according to the AAMC. That number could increase to as high as 124,000 by 2034.\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \nWhile the number of medical students and residents has risen, it's not fast enough to keep up with the increasing demand for care as record numbers of clinicians leave the workforce because of pandemic burnout or retirement.\nDr. Atul Grover, the executive director of the AAMC Research and Action Institute, told Insider this demand was because the federal government arbitrarily capped its share of the costs for medical training in the late '90s.\nFor example, federal funding for residency programs was largely capped in 1997 \u2014 on the heels of worries that the US would have a surplus of doctors \u2014 and has only recently been modestly increased.\nThere was a record 40,375 residency spots for the graduating class of 2023, but it still wasn't enough for all 42,952 graduate applicants to match, meaning nearly 2,600 prospective doctors were left without an opportunity.\nRural areas are prioritized for new residency spots but expected to struggle to bring in new talent, considering that 98% of residency positions in 2020 were at urban hospitals, a Government Accountability Office study found.\nAnd while diversity among medical students is improving, underserved patients of color are still far less likely to get to see a doctor who looks like them, which is linked to better care and outcomes.\nHit with drastic shortages, rural states are investing in medical students from early ages\nFor physicians, \"there is a bit of a geographic battle,\" Grover said, adding: \"We need to figure out how to serve the needs of rural populations \u2014 which we've been trying to do for the past 50 years and it hasn't worked \u2014 and we can't just diversify the healthcare workforce starting in medical school; even high school is almost too late.\"\nInvesting in and keeping the next generation of doctors is the mission of a partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso and the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso.\nThis first cohort is a proof-of-concept. Students will be guided through the process up until admission, which includes a guaranteed interview. If all goes well, they and future students in the program will have a sure path to medical school.\u00a0\nWith considerable sponsorship from local businesses, the pair of universities organize opportunities for El Paso kids to get hands-on exposure to the healthcare industry, starting in elementary school. As part of its new MedFuture program, five high-school students are given preliminary acceptance to medical school (as long as they maintain a qualifying grade-point average), access to summer research opportunities throughout their college years at the University of Texas at El Paso, and help preparing for the MCAT.\n\"Many of the students are first-generation immigrants; they have not had exposure to healthcare professions or how to get there,\" Dr. Richard Lange, the president of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso and dean of the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine, told Insider.\u00a0\nLange said the program selected students with an interest in supporting their community. The idea, he added, is that those participants will have a higher likelihood of staying after medical school and residency.\u00a0\nIt's up to the students to decide whether they want to go on to medical school, but there are plenty of incentives for them to attend a program in Texas. A large portion of the class at the Foster School of Medicine receives scholarships from a $50 million endowment, Lange said.\nAs of 2020, more than 80% of students who went to medical school and did their residencies in Texas stayed in state to practice medicine, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Lange told Insider he estimated that about 15% of graduates from the Foster School of Medicine were placed in residency programs in the El Paso area.\nAnd that benefits patients beyond an increase in the number of physicians in the region, Dr. Cynthia Perry, associate academic dean for admissions at the Foster School of Medicine told Insider. \"For us, it's about cultural competency,\" she said. \"The students that are from our region and go on to train and practice here relate to their patients and understand the obstacles these patients have to endure.\"\u00a0\nMedFuture students are uniquely suited to help patients navigate El Paso's particular system and take advantage of resources a physician from elsewhere might be unaware of, she added.\u00a0\nSome states bootstrap additional residency spots and medical-school scholarships\u00a0\nEven as medical-school graduates nationwide face the limits of residency-match spots, Texas is uniquely positioned. For each in-state medical-school graduate, the state has 1.1 residency spots per graduate, set by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. While there are technically 1.82 slots per graduate nationwide, according to the National Resident Matching Program, this number includes international applicants \u2014 so there are only 0.85 slots per American graduate.\nTexas hospitals have accomplished this by taking advantage of a Medicare policy that provides additional funds for new residency programs, while funded slots in existing programs are capped. The state does the same.\u00a0\nSince 2016, six medical schools have opened in Texas. The number of residency programs in Texas has increased by 49% in the past decade, outpacing the 41% national growth rate.\n\"The state has been very generous in funding these graduate-medical-education programs to make sure that if these students want to stay here, they can,\" Lange said.\nTexas' model is working, and Grover told Insider he saw similar local efforts produce \"homegrown\" doctors from a young age and incentivize them to practice in shortage areas across the country.\u00a0\nWhile about 20% of people in El Paso are estimated to live in poverty, the city benefits from medical-education funding provided by the state, which has the second-highest GDP in the country. But state funding won't go as far in poorer states with even-worse physician shortages and higher rates of premature deaths, heart disease, obesity, and overall poor health, including Mississippi or Louisiana.\u00a0\n\"We need to figure out how to fortify the pipeline of new physicians, and we need to figure out how to make full use of everyone in all the healthcare professionals,\" Grover said.\n\n                              Read next\n                            \nJump to\n",

California currently has the most number of active physicians of any U.S. state, with around 125,566 physicians. In California, the specialties with the most physicians are psychiatry, emergency medicine, and anesthesiology. \nSpecialty areas\nIn general, the most common specialty areas for physicians in the U.S. are emergency medicine, psychiatry, surgery, and anesthesiology. As of 2024, there were around 58,900 psychiatrists in the U.S. Concerning the gender distribution of specialty physicians, males out number females in almost every specialty, with exceptions found in mainly in various pediatric disciplines, and obstetrics and gynecology. \nCompensation\nThe specialty areas with the highest average annual compensation are plastic surgery, orthopedics, and cardiology. As of 2024, a physician in orthopedics earned an average of 558,000 U.S. dollars per year. Male physicians still earn more than their female counterparts in both primary care and specialty settings. This difference is especially large in specialty settings where male physicians earn more than 100,000 dollars more per year than female physicians.\n\n                        Leading 10 U.S. states with the most number of active physicians as of 2024\n                    \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nJuly 2024\nUnited States\nas of January 2024\nData includes currently active allopathic physicians (MDs) and osteopathic physicians (DOs).\r\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\r\n\nOther statistics on the topic\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nNumber of specialty physicians in the U.S. 2024, by field of specialty\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nNumber of physicians in the U.S. by specialty and gender 2021\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nTotal active physicians in the U.S. 2024, by state\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nAnnual compensation of U.S. physicians by specialty 2024\n* For commercial use only\n\n                            Basic Account\n                        \n\n                            Starter Account\n                        \n\n                            Professional Account\n                        \n1\n                        All prices do not include sales tax.

      "A Texas town is trying to solve the US physician shortage with 'homegrown' clinicians \u2014 a possible answer to the primary-care drought plaguing 100 million Americans\nEighteen-year-old Makena Pi\u00f1on had a first-hand view of the medical gaps in El Paso's healthcare system.\nBorn with a congenital heart defect, Pi\u00f1on underwent her first operation at 5 months old, followed by open-heart surgery at 11.\n\"El Paso is a very underserved community,\" she told Insider. \"Being a patient all my life in Houston and then having hospital visits here in El Paso, you can see the difference in the care and how advanced the medicine is,\" Pi\u00f1on said.\nThis year, Pi\u00f1on was one of five El Paso teenagers celebrating an unusual milestone for high-school seniors: She was effectively accepted into medical school, at least four years before most aspiring physicians find out whether they got in.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis nontraditional path to a white-coat ceremony is part of a new, local partnership that aims to combat its hometown's physician shortage with guaranteed spots in medical school, mentorship, Medical College Admission Test preparation, and summer internships. The hope is they will stay and practice medicine in El Paso after medical school and residency.\n\"I really hope to provide a perspective and knowledge to the community here and help to serve patients who might otherwise have to leave because there aren't as many doctors here and I'd like to slowly but surely help keep more patients here,\" Pi\u00f1on said.\nEl Paso County, which includes the city of the same name, is among the 95% of Texas counties that have a shortage of primary-care physicians. They're not alone \u2014 just shy of 100 million Americans live in an area with a shortage of primary-care physicians. And demand for medical care is growing as the American population ages, outstripping supply.\nThe shortages are especially dire in rural areas, where 20% of Americans live but only 10% of doctors practice. The program in Texas for high-school students is adding needed doctors to the primary-care-physician pipeline and could offer a model for other communities facing similar challenges.\nFederal funding could aid and expand the healthcare workforce, but it may not be enough to meet the demand among rural populations. One key to addressing the lack of physicians could be a \"homegrown\" approach to making \u2014 and keeping \u2014 more doctors, nurses, and other clinicians in the areas where they are needed most through mentorship opportunities and state- and privately funded scholarships.\nLimits to the industry's education system leave some medical students without jobs\u00a0\nThe number of students enrolled in medical school grew by 9% between 2010 and 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics \u2014 plus another 3% from 2021 to the 2022-23 academic year, according to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges. But the US is on track to have a shortage of around 48,200 to 73,700 doctors by 2024, according to the AAMC. That number could increase to as high as 124,000 by 2034.\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \nWhile the number of medical students and residents has risen, it's not fast enough to keep up with the increasing demand for care as record numbers of clinicians leave the workforce because of pandemic burnout or retirement.\nDr. Atul Grover, the executive director of the AAMC Research and Action Institute, told Insider this demand was because the federal government arbitrarily capped its share of the costs for medical training in the late '90s.\nFor example, federal funding for residency programs was largely capped in 1997 \u2014 on the heels of worries that the US would have a surplus of doctors \u2014 and has only recently been modestly increased.\nThere was a record 40,375 residency spots for the graduating class of 2023, but it still wasn't enough for all 42,952 graduate applicants to match, meaning nearly 2,600 prospective doctors were left without an opportunity.\nRural areas are prioritized for new residency spots but expected to struggle to bring in new talent, considering that 98% of residency positions in 2020 were at urban hospitals, a Government Accountability Office study found.\nAnd while diversity among medical students is improving, underserved patients of color are still far less likely to get to see a doctor who looks like them, which is linked to better care and outcomes.\nHit with drastic shortages, rural states are investing in medical students from early ages\nFor physicians, \"there is a bit of a geographic battle,\" Grover said, adding: \"We need to figure out how to serve the needs of rural populations \u2014 which we've been trying to do for the past 50 years and it hasn't worked \u2014 and we can't just diversify the healthcare workforce starting in medical school; even high school is almost too late.\"\nInvesting in and keeping the next generation of doctors is the mission of a partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso and the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso.\nThis first cohort is a proof-of-concept. Students will be guided through the process up until admission, which includes a guaranteed interview. If all goes well, they and future students in the program will have a sure path to medical school.\u00a0\nWith considerable sponsorship from local businesses, the pair of universities organize opportunities for El Paso kids to get hands-on exposure to the healthcare industry, starting in elementary school. As part of its new MedFuture program, five high-school students are given preliminary acceptance to medical school (as long as they maintain a qualifying grade-point average), access to summer research opportunities throughout their college years at the University of Texas at El Paso, and help preparing for the MCAT.\n\"Many of the students are first-generation immigrants; they have not had exposure to healthcare professions or how to get there,\" Dr. Richard Lange, the president of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso and dean of the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine, told Insider.\u00a0\nLange said the program selected students with an interest in supporting their community. The idea, he added, is that those participants will have a higher likelihood of staying after medical school and residency.\u00a0\nIt's up to the students to decide whether they want to go on to medical school, but there are plenty of incentives for them to attend a program in Texas. A large portion of the class at the Foster School of Medicine receives scholarships from a $50 million endowment, Lange said.\nAs of 2020, more than 80% of students who went to medical school and did their residencies in Texas stayed in state to practice medicine, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Lange told Insider he estimated that about 15% of graduates from the Foster School of Medicine were placed in residency programs in the El Paso area.\nAnd that benefits patients beyond an increase in the number of physicians in the region, Dr. Cynthia Perry, associate academic dean for admissions at the Foster School of Medicine told Insider. \"For us, it's about cultural competency,\" she said. \"The students that are from our region and go on to train and practice here relate to their patients and understand the obstacles these patients have to endure.\"\u00a0\nMedFuture students are uniquely suited to help patients navigate El Paso's particular system and take advantage of resources a physician from elsewhere might be unaware of, she added.\u00a0\nSome states bootstrap additional residency spots and medical-school scholarships\u00a0\nEven as medical-school graduates nationwide face the limits of residency-match spots, Texas is uniquely positioned. For each in-state medical-school graduate, the state has 1.1 residency spots per graduate, set by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. While there are technically 1.82 slots per graduate nationwide, according to the National Resident Matching Program, this number includes international applicants \u2014 so there are only 0.85 slots per American graduate.\nTexas hospitals have accomplished this by taking advantage of a Medicare policy that provides additional funds for new residency programs, while funded slots in existing programs are capped. The state does the same.\u00a0\nSince 2016, six medical schools have opened in Texas. The number of residency programs in Texas has increased by 49% in the past decade, outpacing the 41% national growth rate.\n\"The state has been very generous in funding these graduate-medical-education programs to make sure that if these students want to stay here, they can,\" Lange said.\nTexas' model is working, and Grover told Insider he saw similar local efforts produce \"homegrown\" doctors from a young age and incentivize them to practice in shortage areas across the country.\u00a0\nWhile about 20% of people in El Paso are estimated to live in poverty, the city benefits from medical-education funding provided by the state, which has the second-highest GDP in the country. But state funding won't go as far in poorer states with even-worse physician shortages and higher rates of premature deaths, heart disease, obesity, and overall poor health, including Mississippi or Louisiana.\u00a0\n\"We need to figure out how to fortify the pipeline of new physicians, and we need to figure out how to make full use of everyone in all the healthcare professionals,\" Grover said.\n\n                              Read next\n                            \nJump to\n",

As of 2024, a physician in orthopedics earned an average of 558,000 U.S. dollars per year. Male physicians still earn more than their female counterparts in both primary care and specialty settings. This difference is especially large in specialty settings where male physicians earn more than 100,000 dollars more per year than female physicians.\n\n                        Leading 10 U.S. states with the most number of active physicians as of 2024\n                    \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nJuly 2024\nUnited States\nas of January 2024\nData includes currently active allopathic physicians (MDs) and osteopathic physicians (DOs).\r\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\r\n\nOther statistics on the topic\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nNumber of specialty physicians in the U.S. 2024, by field of specialty\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nNumber of physicians in the U.S. by specialty and gender 2021\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nTotal active physicians in the U.S. 2024, by state\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nAnnual compensation of U.S. physicians by specialty 2024\n* For commercial use only\n\n                            Basic Account\n                        \n\n                            Starter Account\n                        \n\n                            Professional Account\n                        \n1\n                        All prices do not include sales tax.

      "Texas primary care doctor shortage spikes during the pandemic; rural Texans hit hardest\n\u201cThere\u2019s one family physician for 5,000 patients in the Big Bend area right now,\u201d says one rural doctor.\n\nBy Bonnie PetrieNovember 17, 2021\u00a05:00 pmHealth & Science, Partner Organizations, Texas Public Radio, The Texas Newsroom\n\n\n\n\nGO NAKAMURA\n/\nREUTERS\nDr. Mark Key walks into Medical Arts Hospital in Lamesa, Texas, on Dec. 16, 2020. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nFrom TPR:\nTexas\u2019 primary care doctor shortage has taken a sharp turn for the worse during the pandemic, and one rural family doctor is imploring state lawmakers to do something about it.\nDr. Adrian Billings is chief medical officer for Preventative Care Health Services, a health center with clinics in Alpine, Marfa and Presidio. He\u2019s a primary care doctor and there aren\u2019t anywhere near enough of them in Big Bend.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one family physician for 5,000 patients in the Big Bend area right now. That\u2019s a delay of care,\u201d Billings told the House Public Health Committee of the Texas Legislature this fall. \u201cThat means sicker patients, that means more costly or care. That means less productivity. That means more death.\u201d\nThe federal government\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration classifies areas with fewer than one primary care provider for every 3,500 residents as Health Professional Shortage Areas, or HPSA\u2019s.\nBig Bend is definitely an HPSA, but according to research done by American Public Media Research Lab, Big Bend is hardly unique in Texas \u2014 and the pandemic isn\u2019t helping.\n\u201cIn 2019, 129 of Texas\u2019s 254 counties identified as a shortage area for primary care providers. As of this July 2021, that number jumped up to 228. So it increased by 99 counties,\u201d said Katherine Sypher, a data journalism fellow with the APM research lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are only five counties in Texas that didn\u2019t have any significant number of primary care physician shortages, four of those were Metropolitan,\u201d Sypher said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s also important to note that a lot of the counties in Texas that are experiencing these shortages are rural and already were experiencing a lack of health care providers to begin with.\u201d\nBack in Alpine, Billings said the primary care doctor shortage was hard enough to manage back before COVID, but the pandemic has been a body blow.\n\u201cSince February of this year, this area has lost five physicians; four family physicians in the area\u2019s only pediatrician. We lost a nurse practitioner, and we lost a physician\u2019s assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s seven primary care providers in this area, which represents over 50% of our physician workforce that covers this vast 12,000 square mile area that we serve in a population of about 25,000.\u201d\nBillings said providing medical care to a region the size of Big Bend is a team effort, but they don\u2019t have a deep bench. They don\u2019t have anyone to sub in when the team is overwhelmed.\n\u201cAt times, we had to shut down our behavioral health service line, our dental service line and our primary care service line in order just to focus on mass vaccination days, because that bench was empty,\u201d he said.\nThat has implications for people who need to say a doctor for a COVID test \u2014 or anything.\n\u201cWe\u2019re booking out now three weeks as our next available appointment in our practice and there are patients that that need to be seen they need to be seen today. And you know we\u2019re doing our best to try and squeeze them in and we tend to be overbooking ourselves.\u201d\nOn July 5, Big Bend Regional Medical Center had to temporarily close the only labor and delivery unit between El Paso and Del Rio \u2014 which are over 400 miles apart \u2014 because of a shortage of labor and delivery nurses.\nBillings said it\u2019s that kind of stress that is driving some primary care doctors out of the field \u2014 the stress of working so hard and still not being able to provide the care a community needs.\n\u201cThe acute pressure right now on our primary care system in our healthcare system is trying to deal with COVID, but the unintended consequences, years down the road are likely a worsening in the prevalence of these chronic diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to mention just the burnout of our healthcare workforce.\u201d\nRural Texans\u2019 access to healthcare is also reduced by lack of health coverage. According to APM research lab, Texas has the highest uninsured rate among all states, with nearly 1 in 5 residents living without insurance. One reason for that is Texas is one of only 12 states who rejected the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That has led to rural hospitals closures, and, Billings said, exacerbated the primary care doctor shortage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the lack of Texas expanding Medicaid, is one of the big reasons why physicians \u2014 especially your primary care (physicians) \u2014 have left the state or have just retired,\u201d he said.\nBillings proposes what he calls the Texas Center for Rural Health Education\n\u201cThis center would be a training center of excellence for educating rural healthcare students, nurses, physicians, advanced practice clinicians, pharmacists, social workers, behavioral health workers, and public health professionals that are so lacking in our rural communities,\u201d he said.\nIf something doesn\u2019t change, the outlook is bleak. In May of 2020, early in the pandemic, the Department of State Health Services projected that the shortage of family doctors was likely to increase from just over a thousand in 2018 to nearly 2,500 in 2032.\nBillings does not believe those numbers are written in stone, however. Or at least they shouldn\u2019t be, as he told the House Public Health Committee of the Texas Legislature in October.\n\u201cA Texans\u2019 rural zip code should not be a risk factor for their health, owing to an inability to access care in their own communities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf you found the reporting above valuable, please consider making a donation to support it here.

      "Texas primary care doctor shortage spikes during the pandemic; rural Texans hit hardest\n\u201cThere\u2019s one family physician for 5,000 patients in the Big Bend area right now,\u201d says one rural doctor.\n\nBy Bonnie PetrieNovember 17, 2021\u00a05:00 pmHealth & Science, Partner Organizations, Texas Public Radio, The Texas Newsroom\n\n\n\n\nGO NAKAMURA\n/\nREUTERS\nDr. Mark Key walks into Medical Arts Hospital in Lamesa, Texas, on Dec. 16, 2020. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nFrom TPR:\nTexas\u2019 primary care doctor shortage has taken a sharp turn for the worse during the pandemic, and one rural family doctor is imploring state lawmakers to do something about it.\nDr. Adrian Billings is chief medical officer for Preventative Care Health Services, a health center with clinics in Alpine, Marfa and Presidio. He\u2019s a primary care doctor and there aren\u2019t anywhere near enough of them in Big Bend.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one family physician for 5,000 patients in the Big Bend area right now. That\u2019s a delay of care,\u201d Billings told the House Public Health Committee of the Texas Legislature this fall. \u201cThat means sicker patients, that means more costly or care. That means less productivity. That means more death.\u201d\nThe federal government\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration classifies areas with fewer than one primary care provider for every 3,500 residents as Health Professional Shortage Areas, or HPSA\u2019s.\nBig Bend is definitely an HPSA, but according to research done by American Public Media Research Lab, Big Bend is hardly unique in Texas \u2014 and the pandemic isn\u2019t helping.\n\u201cIn 2019, 129 of Texas\u2019s 254 counties identified as a shortage area for primary care providers. As of this July 2021, that number jumped up to 228. So it increased by 99 counties,\u201d said Katherine Sypher, a data journalism fellow with the APM research lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are only five counties in Texas that didn\u2019t have any significant number of primary care physician shortages, four of those were Metropolitan,\u201d Sypher said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s also important to note that a lot of the counties in Texas that are experiencing these shortages are rural and already were experiencing a lack of health care providers to begin with.\u201d\nBack in Alpine, Billings said the primary care doctor shortage was hard enough to manage back before COVID, but the pandemic has been a body blow.\n\u201cSince February of this year, this area has lost five physicians; four family physicians in the area\u2019s only pediatrician. We lost a nurse practitioner, and we lost a physician\u2019s assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s seven primary care providers in this area, which represents over 50% of our physician workforce that covers this vast 12,000 square mile area that we serve in a population of about 25,000.\u201d\nBillings said providing medical care to a region the size of Big Bend is a team effort, but they don\u2019t have a deep bench. They don\u2019t have anyone to sub in when the team is overwhelmed.\n\u201cAt times, we had to shut down our behavioral health service line, our dental service line and our primary care service line in order just to focus on mass vaccination days, because that bench was empty,\u201d he said.\nThat has implications for people who need to say a doctor for a COVID test \u2014 or anything.\n\u201cWe\u2019re booking out now three weeks as our next available appointment in our practice and there are patients that that need to be seen they need to be seen today. And you know we\u2019re doing our best to try and squeeze them in and we tend to be overbooking ourselves.\u201d\nOn July 5, Big Bend Regional Medical Center had to temporarily close the only labor and delivery unit between El Paso and Del Rio \u2014 which are over 400 miles apart \u2014 because of a shortage of labor and delivery nurses.\nBillings said it\u2019s that kind of stress that is driving some primary care doctors out of the field \u2014 the stress of working so hard and still not being able to provide the care a community needs.\n\u201cThe acute pressure right now on our primary care system in our healthcare system is trying to deal with COVID, but the unintended consequences, years down the road are likely a worsening in the prevalence of these chronic diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to mention just the burnout of our healthcare workforce.\u201d\nRural Texans\u2019 access to healthcare is also reduced by lack of health coverage. According to APM research lab, Texas has the highest uninsured rate among all states, with nearly 1 in 5 residents living without insurance. One reason for that is Texas is one of only 12 states who rejected the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That has led to rural hospitals closures, and, Billings said, exacerbated the primary care doctor shortage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the lack of Texas expanding Medicaid, is one of the big reasons why physicians \u2014 especially your primary care (physicians) \u2014 have left the state or have just retired,\u201d he said.\nBillings proposes what he calls the Texas Center for Rural Health Education\n\u201cThis center would be a training center of excellence for educating rural healthcare students, nurses, physicians, advanced practice clinicians, pharmacists, social workers, behavioral health workers, and public health professionals that are so lacking in our rural communities,\u201d he said.\nIf something doesn\u2019t change, the outlook is bleak. In May of 2020, early in the pandemic, the Department of State Health Services projected that the shortage of family doctors was likely to increase from just over a thousand in 2018 to nearly 2,500 in 2032.\nBillings does not believe those numbers are written in stone, however. Or at least they shouldn\u2019t be, as he told the House Public Health Committee of the Texas Legislature in October.\n\u201cA Texans\u2019 rural zip code should not be a risk factor for their health, owing to an inability to access care in their own communities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf you found the reporting above valuable, please consider making a donation to support it here.

He\u2019s a primary care doctor and there aren\u2019t anywhere near enough of them in Big Bend.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one family physician for 5,000 patients in the Big Bend area right now. That\u2019s a delay of care,\u201d Billings told the House Public Health Committee of the Texas Legislature this fall. \u201cThat means sicker patients, that means more costly or care. That means less productivity. That means more death.\u201d\nThe federal government\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration classifies areas with fewer than one primary care provider for every 3,500 residents as Health Professional Shortage Areas, or HPSA\u2019s.\nBig Bend is definitely an HPSA, but according to research done by American Public Media Research Lab, Big Bend is hardly unique in Texas \u2014 and the pandemic isn\u2019t helping.\n\u201cIn 2019, 129 of Texas\u2019s 254 counties identified as a shortage area for primary care providers. As of this July 2021, that number jumped up to 228. So it increased by 99 counties,\u201d said Katherine Sypher, a data journalism fellow with the APM research lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are only five counties in Texas that didn\u2019t have any significant number of primary care physician shortages, four of those were Metropolitan,\u201d Sypher said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s also important to note that a lot of the counties in Texas that are experiencing these shortages are rural and already were experiencing a lack of health care providers to begin with.\u201d\nBack in Alpine, Billings said the primary care doctor shortage was hard enough to manage back before COVID, but the pandemic has been a body blow.\n\u201cSince February of this year, this area has lost five physicians; four family physicians in the area\u2019s only pediatrician. We lost a nurse practitioner, and we lost a physician\u2019s assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s seven primary care providers in this area, which represents over 50% of our physician workforce that covers this vast 12,000 square mile area that we serve in a population of about 25,000.\u201d\nBillings said providing medical care to a region the size of Big Bend is a team effort, but they don\u2019t have a deep bench. They don\u2019t have anyone to sub in when the team is overwhelmed.\n\u201cAt times, we had to shut down our behavioral health service line, our dental service line and our primary care service line in order just to focus on mass vaccination days, because that bench was empty,\u201d he said.\nThat has implications for people who need to say a doctor for a COVID test \u2014 or anything.\n\u201cWe\u2019re booking out now three weeks as our next available appointment in our practice and there are patients that that need to be seen they need to be seen today. And you know we\u2019re doing our best to try and squeeze them in and we tend to be overbooking ourselves.\u201d\nOn July 5, Big Bend Regional Medical Center had to temporarily close the only labor and delivery unit between El Paso and Del Rio \u2014 which are over 400 miles apart \u2014 because of a shortage of labor and delivery nurses.\nBillings said it\u2019s that kind of stress that is driving some primary care doctors out of the field \u2014 the stress of working so hard and still not being able to provide the care a community needs.\n\u201cThe acute pressure right now on our primary care system in our healthcare system is trying to deal with COVID, but the unintended consequences, years down the road are likely a worsening in the prevalence of these chronic diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to mention just the burnout of our healthcare workforce.\u201d\nRural Texans\u2019 access to healthcare is also reduced by lack of health coverage. According to APM research lab, Texas has the highest uninsured rate among all states, with nearly 1 in 5 residents living without insurance. One reason for that is Texas is one of only 12 states who rejected the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That has led to rural hospitals closures, and, Billings said, exacerbated the primary care doctor shortage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the lack of Texas expanding Medicaid, is one of the big reasons why physicians \u2014 especially your primary care (physicians) \u2014 have left the state or have just retired,\u201d he said.\nBillings proposes what he calls the Texas Center for Rural Health Education\n\u201cThis center would be a training center of excellence for educating rural healthcare students, nurses, physicians, advanced practice clinicians, pharmacists, social workers, behavioral health workers, and public health professionals that are so lacking in our rural communities,\u201d he said.\nIf something doesn\u2019t change, the outlook is bleak. In May of 2020, early in the pandemic, the Department of State Health Services projected that the shortage of family doctors was likely to increase from just over a thousand in 2018 to nearly 2,500 in 2032.\nBillings does not believe those numbers are written in stone, however. Or at least they shouldn\u2019t be, as he told the House Public Health Committee of the Texas Legislature in October.\n\u201cA Texans\u2019 rural zip code should not be a risk factor for their health, owing to an inability to access care in their own communities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf you found the reporting above valuable, please consider making a donation to support it here.

The state is seeing a shortage of physicians to meet the demands of the growing population.\nWith a shortage in care, that leads to longer appointment wait times and other issues.\nKate Snedeker knows the importance of getting a checkup. She lost her dad to a rare brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, earlier this year.\n\"If he hadn't gone to get it checked on again when he did, he would have been a lot more negatively impacted than he was immediately after,\" Snedeker said.\nBut the University of Texas at Austin senior said getting in to see a doctor herself has been tough.\n\"I was put on a waitlist to see someone for mental health freshman year, and I think I'm still on it. And I'm going to be a senior,\" Snedeker said.\nIt's become a problem for patients across the Lone Star State. According to the Texas Medical Association (TMA), Texas has 204.6 physicians per 100,000 people. The national average is closer to 245.5 per 100,000.\n\"Over the past decade, the population of Texas has grown by about 12% or so. The physician population of Texas has about doubled that, or about 25% increase during that period of time,\" said Dr. Rodney Young, a former chair for TMA's Council on Medical Education.\nYoung said that is great progress and that those ratios used to be worse. The state has opened new medical schools and put itself on the map for up-and-coming doctors. Still, many only practice in urban areas.\n\"We have this vast area of Texas where you have all these rural counties with very limited access to care. So we do still have a lot of work before us,\" Young said.\nRelated Articles\n\nCompany provides virtual alternative for primary health care\nAscension Seton Hays is delivering a lot of babies\n\nEven in town, Snedeker said she is now starting to plan her appointments months in advance.\n\"I've learned that I need to, when I come home from school, I need to book it at the beginning of the summer or the beginning of winter break to make sure that I can be seen,\" Snedeker said.\nBut as new medical schools and residency programs expand, Snedeker and Young are hopeful for a more stable future for physicians and patients in Texas.\nFord Sanders on social media:\u202fFacebook\u202f|\u202fTwitter\u202f|\u202fInstagram\nKVUE on social media:\u202fFacebook\u202f|\u202fTwitter\u202f|\u202fInstagram\u202f|\u202fYouTube\nClose Ad\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAd Choices\n\n\nEEO Public File Report\n\nFCC Online Public Inspection File\nClosed Caption Procedures\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n\u00a9 2024 KVUE-TV.

The state is seeing a shortage of physicians to meet the demands of the growing population.\nWith a shortage in care, that leads to longer appointment wait times and other issues.\nKate Snedeker knows the importance of getting a checkup. She lost her dad to a rare brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, earlier this year.\n\"If he hadn't gone to get it checked on again when he did, he would have been a lot more negatively impacted than he was immediately after,\" Snedeker said.\nBut the University of Texas at Austin senior said getting in to see a doctor herself has been tough.\n\"I was put on a waitlist to see someone for mental health freshman year, and I think I'm still on it. And I'm going to be a senior,\" Snedeker said.\nIt's become a problem for patients across the Lone Star State. According to the Texas Medical Association (TMA), Texas has 204.6 physicians per 100,000 people. The national average is closer to 245.5 per 100,000.\n\"Over the past decade, the population of Texas has grown by about 12% or so. The physician population of Texas has about doubled that, or about 25% increase during that period of time,\" said Dr. Rodney Young, a former chair for TMA's Council on Medical Education.\nYoung said that is great progress and that those ratios used to be worse. The state has opened new medical schools and put itself on the map for up-and-coming doctors. Still, many only practice in urban areas.\n\"We have this vast area of Texas where you have all these rural counties with very limited access to care. So we do still have a lot of work before us,\" Young said.\nRelated Articles\n\nCompany provides virtual alternative for primary health care\nAscension Seton Hays is delivering a lot of babies\n\nEven in town, Snedeker said she is now starting to plan her appointments months in advance.\n\"I've learned that I need to, when I come home from school, I need to book it at the beginning of the summer or the beginning of winter break to make sure that I can be seen,\" Snedeker said.\nBut as new medical schools and residency programs expand, Snedeker and Young are hopeful for a more stable future for physicians and patients in Texas.\nFord Sanders on social media:\u202fFacebook\u202f|\u202fTwitter\u202f|\u202fInstagram\nKVUE on social media:\u202fFacebook\u202f|\u202fTwitter\u202f|\u202fInstagram\u202f|\u202fYouTube\nClose Ad\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAd Choices\n\n\nEEO Public File Report\n\nFCC Online Public Inspection File\nClosed Caption Procedures\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n\u00a9 2024 KVUE-TV.

Establishing an infrastructure and resources to support this process at the state level can accelerate the translation of research into practice. This study describes the adaptation and initial evaluation of the Texas Research-to-Policy Collaboration (TX RPC) Project, focusing on the adaptation process, legislative public health policy priorities, and baseline researcher policy knowledge and self-efficacy.\nIntervention Approach\nThe federal Research-to-Policy Collaboration (RPC) method was adapted to the Texas legislative process in 2020. Policymakers and public health researchers were recruited using direct outreach and referrals. Legislators or their aides were interviewed to determine health policy needs, which directed the development of legislator resources, webinars, and recruitment of additional public health researchers with specific expertise. Researchers were trained to facilitate communication with policymakers, and TX RPC Project staff facilitated legislator and researcher meetings to provide data and policy input.\nEvaluation Methods\nBaseline surveys were completed with legislators to assess the use of health researchers in policy. Surveys were also administered before training to researchers assessing self-efficacy, knowledge, and training needs. Qualitative data from the legislator interviews were analyzed using inductive and deductive approaches. Quantitative survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics for scales and individual survey items.\nResults\nLegislative offices (n = 21) identified health care access, mental health, and health disparities as key health issues. Legislators reported that health data were important but did not actively involve researchers in legislation. Researchers (n = 73) reported that policy informed their work but had low engagement with legislators. Researcher training surveys indicated lower policy self-efficacy and knowledge and the need for additional training.\nImplications for Public Health\nAdaptation of the RPC model for state-level health policy is feasible but necessitates logistical changes based on the unique legislative body. Researchers need training and resources to engage with policymakers.\nTop\nIntroduction\nAlthough it is well accepted that nonmedical drivers of health or social determinants of health, such as housing, food insecurity, and transportation, exert significant effects on population health (1\u20133), recent scholars have begun to look further upstream at political determinants of health (4). Political determinants of health can be defined as the forces that reinforce or influence environmental or system-level factors that either exacerbate or attenuate health equity (4). These determinants, which include voting, government, and policy, are the forces that shape the environmental or systemic factors influencing health equity, either exacerbating disparities or contributing to their mitigation (4). Recognizing the critical interplay between civic participation and health, Healthy People 2030 has set a national health objective to increase the proportion of voting-age citizens who participate in elections (5). This acknowledgment underscores the importance of engaging with political determinants of health as a means to advance evidence-based health policies, highlighting a focus for health professionals aiming to improve health outcomes by bridging the gap between research findings and policy implementation.\nBridging the gap from health research to policy implementation remains a serious challenge, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers and policymakers have historically operated in distinct spheres with minimal collaboration (6). This separation is compounded by factors such as differing political structures, cultural beliefs and values, and the inherent trade-offs between costs and benefits, which introduces uncertainty into the process of advancing health policies at the population level. Further, the decision-making processes of researchers and policymakers are notably different and may hamper the connection and collaboration between the 2 groups (6,7). Researchers tend to engage in discrete, planned projects, whereas policymakers navigate a shorter, unplanned flow of tasks, often responding to immediate needs and unforeseen events. The difference in approach results in researchers needing time to collect or compile data to provide evidence-based recommendations, whereas policymakers must often make quick decisions, which are not always grounded in the empirical data that researchers value. Instead, policymakers may resort to rapidly acquired information, which may lack credibility. Recognizing and addressing these operational differences can enhance the translation of research into practice. Such efforts could substantially improve the effectiveness of public health policies and influence political determinants of health (8).\nEven acknowledging the challenges and differences in operations between researchers and policymakers as a fundamental barrier, translation from research to policy is further complicated by additional and substantial barriers. Numerous studies have explored the mechanisms and challenges to better link research and policy (9\u201312). Caplan\u2019s \u201ctwo-communities\u201d theory (13) from 1979 suggests that differing priorities, languages, and reward structures cause the gap between research and policy. Other barriers in translating research to policy include few direct interactions between policymakers and researchers, a lack of trust between policymakers and researchers, the perception that research is untimely or irrelevant, divergent communication styles, conflicting priorities, and budgetary pressures (8,10\u201312). This body of research emphasizes the importance of personal engagement and trusting relationships between researchers and policymakers to transfer research to policy effectively (14). Further, it underscores that these relationships are both timely and sensitive to the constraints policymakers face (15).\nIn response to these persistent barriers, recent initiatives have aimed to provide practical guidance for researchers to more effectively bridge the gap between research and policy. Haynes et al conducted a qualitative analysis of Australian civil servants (16) that identified 3 key attributes of researchers that policymakers particularly value: competence, integrity, and benevolence. Similarly, Oliver and Cairney\u2019s (17) systematic review builds on this perspective by outlining a strategic framework for academic engagement in the policy process, emphasizing delivering high-quality research, fostering relationships with policymakers, and defining a clear stance as either a committed advocate or a neutral \u201chonest broker.\u201d Furthermore, there is growing consensus that a more sophisticated, bi-directional model enhances researchers\u2019 ability to communicate findings, adapt projects to meet policy-relevant research questions, and understand organizational advocacy guidelines, while also encouraging policymakers to proactively engage with researchers ahead of legislative windows and offer political insights for selecting achievable policy-informed research objectives. This reciprocal relationship hinges on the establishment of trusted partnerships wherein researchers serve as honest brokers \u2014 an objective resource for navigating the complexities of policymaking (18,19).\nLeveraging the insights from this body of research, the Research-to-Policy Collaboration (RPC) model was developed to facilitate personal researcher\u2013policymaker relationships at the federal level and support the generation of timely and relevant evidence materials. A pilot study (7,20) of the RPC model was conducted, focusing on criminal justice policy efforts at the federal level. The aim of the study was to determine the effects on legislative\u2013researcher connections and legislator and prevention scientist engagement, in addition to the cost-effectiveness of this approach. Ten Congressional offices participated in the pilot, which was conducted over 230 days. Results illustrated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this model for fostering personal connections between researchers and policymakers at the federal level. The study also highlighted that the most common legislative requests involved reviewing preventive intervention strategies (37%) and summarizing etiologic evidence (23%) (20).\nThe RPC model was developed to address systematic barriers and infrastructure needs that affect researchers\u2019 engagement with policymakers to accelerate the implementation of evidence-based policy by using a 7-step process (21,22). Evaluation of this model shows a greater use of research evidence in legislative offices using this process and increased policy engagement among participating researchers (15,20). The RPC model comprises both capacity-building and collaboration components. More detailed descriptions of the RPC process can be found elsewhere (21), but an overview of the process is described below.\nFor capacity-building, Step 1 is assessing legislators\u2019 policy goals and identifying policy champions on issues of interest. Once policy goals have been elucidated, researchers with relevant expertise are identified to form a resource network (Step 2). Step 3 involves matching policymakers with researchers who can provide relevant information or data to support legislative actions. Before engaging with legislators, researchers participate in training and ongoing technical assistance, providing context and skills to ensure effective communication between the legislator and the researchers (Step 4).\nTo build collaboration in policymaker\u2013research matches, Step 5 of the RPC process entails rapid-response meetings, where legislative offices and researchers are brought together to discuss policy goals and develop a plan for relevant resource development and interactions. In Step 6, meetings are followed by initial strategic planning, which outlines goals, action steps, and timelines. Finally, Step 7 focuses on maintaining responsiveness to legislative interests and needs, which could include further involvement in the legislative process, such as testimony, research synthesis, or consultation. The success of this process depends on providing the infrastructure needed by researchers, most of whom are in academic institutions, to develop their knowledge transfer skills and provide needed resources for supporting the network and ongoing implementation (21).\nTop\nPurpose and Objectives\nGiven the success of the RPC model in a federal context, a natural and useful extension of this work is to explore its applicability and potential impact on public health policy within state-level legislative processes. With its distinctive legislative session, Texas presents an ideal case for this exploration and offers a unique opportunity to assess the model\u2019s adaptability and effectiveness in a regional legislative environment. This article details the process of adapting a national framework of researcher\u2013policymaker collaboration to the state level and presents initial evaluation data on the awareness and application of evidence-based policy practices among Texas researchers and policymakers, as well as lessons learned.\nTop\nIntervention Approach\nThe RPC model, designed for application at the federal level (20), was adapted for use within the Texas legislative process for the 2021 Legislative Session as the Texas Research-to-Policy Collaboration (TX RPC) Project (Table 1). This adaptation of the federal RPC evaluation and project tools was informed by prior research conducted with Texas legislators (23) and with input from the developers of the federal RPC model. Recommendations from the members of the project\u2019s advisory committee, which included academic partners and health policy experts, and university governmental relations advisors, further informed the adaptation process. Key modifications were made to ensure the TX RPC Project aligned with the unique timelines and procedures of the Texas legislative cycle. An emphasis was placed on child health legislation and research, reflecting the state\u2019s specific needs, potential areas of bipartisan agreement (24), and the investigators\u2019 area of expertise. Beyond adapting the RPC model, the TX RPC Project expanded its outreach to include newsletters, webinars, and \u201clunch and learn\u201d sessions at the Capitol, complemented by a legislative bill tracker to monitor relevant policy developments.\nThe Texas legislature operates under a schedule mandated by the state constitution, convening every odd-numbered year (eg, 2021, 2023) for 140 days. This biennial session typically spans from the beginning of January through the end of May. Governance is provided by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, elected by the voters, and the Speaker of the House, elected by the House of Representatives. Texas uses a bicameral legislative system, with 150 House members and 31 Senators. House representatives serve 2-year terms, while Senators serve 4-year terms, with elections staggered so that approximately half the Senate is elected every 2 years. Despite the short session, the legislature typically has 7,000 or more bills filed.\nAdapting the RPC methodology to Texas maintained all 7 steps of the model but required logistical and procedural modifications (Table 1). For example, the first 4 steps, which included assessing legislators\u2019 goals, finding researchers with the appropriate expertise, matching legislators and researchers, and training researchers, were very similar to the federal RPC model. The short timeline of the Texas legislative session made it difficult to engage in many rapid-response meetings (Step 5) or to engage in significant strategic planning (Step 6), although we were able to maintain responsiveness to legislative needs (Step 7). Key format and procedural adaptations involved transitioning from federal to state-specific language and methods, which included updates in training protocols, use of shared sites for collaboration, and redesign of data request forms. Format and procedural adaptations included changes in language (federal to state) and methods (eg, training, shared sites, request forms). Modifying the RPC to fit the state legislature was complicated by the part-time availability of policymakers and their geographic dispersion across the state; thus, the RPC timeline was adjusted to accommodate a compressed, biennial legislative session. As a result, the evaluation design was altered to include a pre- and post-test survey and a different format for the researcher\u2013legislator meetings, which included committees rather than one-on-one relationships. The unforeseen challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for physical distancing also led to a pivot to virtual meetings, enabling continued collaboration between policymakers and the TX RPC Project researchers and team members.\nStudy population\nSince this study sought to understand the use of public health research in the Texas legislature, the sample was purposively recruited to represent legislators who lead policy efforts in child and public health. Elected officials in the Texas Senate and House of Representatives previously involved in public health policy, expressing an interest in the topic, appointed to relevant legislative committees such as health and human services, or members of select caucuses were invited to join the TX RPC Project in November 2019. Project staff sent a maximum of 4 recruitment emails to 68 legislative offices, with the goal of enrolling 20 legislative offices. Interested offices received a telephone call follow-up from study staff. A reception event at the state capitol was also held to inform these and other legislators about the study. Interested policymakers and their staff were scheduled for an in-person baseline survey and semi-structured policy identification needs-assessment interview. Baseline assessments were conducted in January, February, and May 2020 with 21 policymakers or their staff, who provided verbal consent to participate.\nExperts in health research from academic, nonacademic, and nonprofit settings in Texas were invited to join the TX RPC Project network of researchers in November 2019 based on their expertise and location in Texas. Project staff contacted 111 researchers by individual email but also recruited researchers through academic or state coalition listservs and an internal weekly newsletter. Up to 3 follow-up emails and phone calls were sent to interested researchers to enroll at least 50 researchers in the network. Researchers interested in participating completed the informed consent form, intake form, and baseline survey online using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) software (25). Training to build capacity for engaging with legislators was offered in person and online to participating researchers, with a goal of training 20 to 30 researchers.\nThe Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas School of Public Health Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (no. HSC-SPH-19\u20130539) reviewed the study and determined it to be exempt for both researchers and legislators.\nCollaborative partnerships\nResearchers in the TX RPC Project Network were matched with participating legislative offices to meet to develop ongoing relationships and provide public health data and resources in preparation for the 2021 Texas Legislative Session. Researchers were matched to legislators based on 1) alignment with legislators\u2019 district location, 2) expertise in reported public health policy priorities of the legislator, 3) availability to commit to a partnership, and 4) high level of engagement in the TX RPC Project Network. The project goal was to support 10 researcher\u2013policymaker partnerships. Forty-five researchers were matched with 21 legislative offices to form collaborative partnerships. Additional researchers who were interested in the project but did not have the time for a legislator match were designated as \u201cresource\u201d members. These researchers served in an ad hoc role, providing expertise when needed for specific legislative requests or other activities (eg, webinars).\nTop\nEvaluation Methods\nMeasures\nThe baseline survey for legislators or their aides was drawn from previous work that established the structural validity of scales used in this study (26). These surveys were conducted in person and assessed 1) use of research evidence (5 items); 2) perceived value of research evidence for policy work (6 items); 3) past and current interactions with researchers (8 items); 4) information sources (19 items); and 5) research training of office staff (4 items). For closed-ended questions, policymakers or their staff indicated agreement using a 5-point Likert scale (1\u2009=\u2009not at all to 5\u2009=\u2009all the time, or 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Scales were developed for each construct by summing responses to the individual items.\nThe semi-structured policy identification needs assessment interview included semi-structured, open-ended questions to ask legislators or their designated staff about 1) policy priorities related to health, well-being, or wellness promotion, 2) strategies to strengthen the impact of policies, and 3) engaging researchers to support health policy efforts. Data from these interviews were used to help our research team prioritize health policy topics for briefs, webinars, and legislative bill tracking, as well as give us insight into each individual legislator\u2019s need for information so that we could match legislators with researchers who had expertise in each health policy area.\nThe online researcher intake form to determine study eligibility collected self-reported demographic information (ie, contact information and organization affiliation), areas of research expertise, prior policy experiences, available time commitment, and preferences for online versus in-person training.\nThe researchers\u2019 baseline survey was drawn from previous work that piloted these measures in the RPC pilot in Congress (7). The TX RPC Project surveys were conducted in an online format and assessed 1) prior policy experiences (1 item); 2) recent policy engagement (14 items); 3) policy-informed research activities (4 items); 4) perceived self-efficacy for engaging with public officials (10 items); 5) reported policy knowledge (7 items); and 6) training needs (9 items). For these closed-ended questions, response options varied; for questions asking about recent policy engagement, researchers responded on a 4-point categorical scale (1 = none to 4 = \u22657 times); for questions about policy-informed research activities, reported policy knowledge, and training needs, researchers responded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree); and for questions regarding perceived self-efficacy engaging with public officials, researchers responded on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = not at all true to 4 = exactly true). Scales were developed for all constructs except prior policy experience by summing responses to individual items.\nData analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel 2007/2016 for Windows XP and Stata software version 16.0 (StataCorp LLC). Descriptive statistics (including frequencies and percentages) were calculated for each question in the baseline assessments and for demographic information. For each set of questions, means, standard deviations, and Cronbach \u03b1 were calculated for the scaled sum of items. Person mean imputation was performed for missing data, where at least 1 item in the scale was nonmissing, to minimize bias introduced by simple case deletion (27). For the researcher training evaluation, mean and standard deviation were calculated for each question and scale. Policy priorities were categorized by health topic at baseline. Semi-structured interview notes were entered into a database, and three research team members performed content analysis to identify relevant themes using standard inductive qualitative methods (28,29).\nTop\nResults\nLegislators (n = 21) included both senators and representatives, with a majority (57.1%) from the Texas House of Representatives; most were female (61.9%). Almost all (90.5%) legislators participated in re-election campaigns in November 2020. Eighty-three researchers enrolled in the TX RPC Project Network, and 59 completed the policy capacity training. Researchers were predominantly female (66.3%) and academics with a university affiliation (89.1%).\nInterviews were conducted with legislators and their staff, including legislative directors, chiefs of staff, legislative assistants and aides, policy analysts, an education specialist, and a district director. The most frequently mentioned health policy priority (Table 2) was health care access/Medicare/Medicaid, which 76.2% of legislators identified as a significant area of concern. Health policy topics mentioned by 40% or more of the respondents included mental health, health disparities, vaping/e-cigarettes, and maternal and child health. Other health policy priorities were Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)/food insecurity, school nutrition, immunizations, disabilities, and violence prevention (Table 2). Because most legislative interviews were conducted in early 2020, COVID-19\u2013related health policy was rarely mentioned.\nBaseline surveys were collected from 73 researchers and 21 legislators (Table 3). Most researchers indicated little prior engagement with policymakers, especially during the policy creation process. In general, researchers tended to agree that policy informed their work but also reported moderate levels of policy-related self-efficacy and policy knowledge. Most researchers reported that they needed more training regarding policy-related training needs (Table 3).\nLegislative offices generally reported a high use of research in policy development, and many strongly agreed that it was valuable to use research in their work. Despite these views, legislative offices reported few interactions with researchers, especially working with researchers to identify research direction or priorities (eg, informing researcher work). Legislative offices often obtained policy-related information from people involved with the policy or program, Texas data, and nonprofit organizations or foundations; however, fewer legislative offices reported obtaining information from researchers, conferences, or program-specific materials (Table 3).\nTop\nImplications for Public Health\nAdaptation of the RPC to a state-level government is feasible but must include changes in logistics that depend on the unique structures and practices of the state legislative body. Health policy priorities identified at the state level by legislative offices included mental health, vaping/e-cigarette use, health disparities, health care access, and food insecurity, all important public health issues. Baseline survey data showed that researchers do not frequently engage with legislative offices in a structured manner across the policy development spectrum and that researchers require training in these skills. Legislative officials realize the value of research, especially state-level data, but do not often engage with researchers. Thus, there is a need for a coordinating organization and process to develop and maintain trusted relationships between researchers and legislative offices.\nThe adaptation of the RPC process to Texas posed unique issues. For example, Texas is 1 of only 4 states with a legislature that meets on a biennial basis (30). This compressed schedule leads to policy development before the actual session and often before the election. Most Texas legislators tend to reside in the state capitol for the 140-day term and then return to their districts and a primary job. In terms of establishing partnerships between policymakers and researchers, this schedule leads to fewer opportunities to interact with policymakers, the necessity of interacting with policymakers in their home districts rather than in the Capitol, and limited time to develop new legislation. The short session also required proactive steps to develop a library of potential resource materials ahead of actual requests based on input from the project advisory committee.\nConducting this work during a pandemic also presented several challenges but additional opportunities. Originally, in-person meetings between researchers and legislators were proposed, which would have necessitated travel expenses for researchers across the state. Since the COVID-19 pandemic led to social distancing, many offices were not at the Capitol during the interim period (2020), and researcher\u2013legislative office meetings were pivoted to an online secure video forum using WebEx. Although the project was not able to arrange face-to-face meetings, the video format provided project cost savings and easier scheduling. The pandemic also resulted in several requests for COVID-19 and vaccine-related data and information, which became a major focus of the TX RPC Project.\nAs with other studies (15,20), our work indicated that researchers generally do not actively engage with policymakers and need additional training, especially in facilitating communication and building trusted relationships with legislators (6,9,31). The RPC project provided training, update meetings, communications, support from the research staff, and resources for both researchers and legislators. This support is necessary, as policy-related activities, which fall under knowledge translation or community-engaged research, often do not count toward the tenure and promotion metrics valued in traditional academic environments (9,21,32). Recent work has called for better inclusion of these activities as academic metrics, in addition to bibliographic output and funding, but universities have not widely adopted this practice (32,33).\nAlthough legislative offices reported using research in health policy development, few reported connecting directly with academics and researchers. Consistent with prior research, potential reasons for limited contact between legislative offices and researchers include inadequate translation of complex research into practical recommendations (34), infrequent interactions between policymakers and legislative offices, and differences in culture (10,11). Training is necessary to overcome some of these communication barriers (31). Building trusted relationships between researchers and legislators facilitates advancing evidence-based policy, providing further evidence for the TX RPC Project approach (12). A recent adaptation of the RPC model, the SciComm Optimizer for Policy Engagement (SCOPE), connected researchers and state legislators using email and was evaluated by using a randomized controlled trial. Results showed that legislators who received the intervention were more likely to use research evidence in their social media posts (35). The TX RPC Project model included more engagement and outreach than the SCOPE process, which might be necessary for a short legislative session like that in Texas. Thus, models for connecting researchers and state legislators can accelerate the knowledge transfer of research into public health action, but further evaluation methods should be used to determine effectiveness.\nThe TX RPC Project model sought to accelerate the adoption and reach of evidence-based public health policy (36) at the state level. The TX RPC Project was the first adaptation of the federal RPC process in which the model developers did not oversee its implementation. Thus, the TX RPC Project provides evidence of scalability and institutionalization of the RPC process in a different setting, suggesting that implementation science approaches can be applied to health policy work (36).\nAlthough the TX RPC Project has several strengths, including building on an existing evidence-based model, current governmental and legislative relationships, and evaluation of the process, there are several limitations. Twenty-one legislators participated in the project, so their views may not reflect the dominant views in the Texas legislature. Alternatively, these legislators might represent the subset interested in advancing public health policy. The participating legislators were identified for their interest in health policy but not for their views on other policy domains. Ideally, every legislator in the Texas legislature would be recruited, but given the short session and limited resources, we chose to prioritize those legislators who were most likely to file and advance health policy legislation. The Texas RPC newsletters were sent to all Texas legislators, and a request form was included that invited legislative offices to contact us for any information related to health policy. Additionally, many of the outcomes of this study are largely based on self-reported process-oriented data. Still, this study demonstrates the utility of the RPC model in a state environment and provides an in-depth evaluation of how Texas legislators view public health researchers as experts in developing effective health policy at the state level.\nThe TX RPC Project illustrates some of the benefits and challenges of linking researchers to policymakers using a model that has been successful at the federal level. With the past few years of federal Congressional gridlock, state legislators are a promising means of innovating health policy (37). Thus, further work at enhancing strategies that promote evidence-based health policy that addresses the political determinants of health (4) at the state level can lead to improved health outcomes that can, in turn, be used as exemplars for other states and the nation.\nTop\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors do not have any conflict of interest to report or relationships that might lead to bias or a conflict of interest.

One in 7 reports (14%) were associated with drug shortages (decreases in sales of \u226533%); supply disruptions increased for drugs with and without reports at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and returned to prepandemic levels after May 2020.\nMeaning\u00a0\r\n    These findings suggest that ongoing policy work is needed to protect US drug supplies from future supply shocks.\nImportance\u00a0\r\n    Drug shortages are a chronic and worsening issue that compromises patient safety. Despite the destabilizing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmaceutical production, it remains unclear whether issues affecting the drug supply chain were more likely to result in meaningful shortages during the pandemic.\nObjective\u00a0\r\n    To estimate the proportion of supply chain issue reports associated with drug shortages overall and with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\u00a0\r\n    This longitudinal cross-sectional study used data from the IQVIA Multinational Integrated Data Analysis database, comprising more than 85% of drug purchases by US pharmacies from wholesalers and manufacturers, from 2017 to 2021. Data were analyzed from January to May 2023.\nExposure\u00a0\r\n    Presence of a supply chain issue report to the US Food and Drug Administration or the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP).\nMain Outcomes and Measures\u00a0\r\n    The main outcome was drug shortage, defined as at least 33% decrease in units purchased within 6 months of a supply chain issue report. Random-effects logistic regression models compared the marginal odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports. Interaction terms assessed heterogeneity prior to vs during the COVID-19 pandemic and by drug characteristics (formulation, age, essential medicine status, clinician- vs self-administered, sales volume, and number of manufacturers).\nResults\u00a0\r\n    A total of 571 drugs exposed to 731 supply chain issue reports were matched to 7296 comparison medications with no reports. After adjusting for drug characteristics, 13.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-17.8%) of supply chain issue reports were associated with subsequent drug shortages vs 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.8%) of comparators (marginal odds ratio [mOR], 3.7 [95% CI, 2.6-5.1]). Shortages increased among both drugs with and without reports in February to April 2020 (34.2% of drugs with supply chain issue reports and 9.5% of comparison drugs; mOR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.1-11.6]), and then decreased after May 2020 (9.8% of drugs with reports and 3.6% of comparison drugs; mOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6-5.3]). Significant associations were identified by formulation (parenteral mOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.2] vs oral mOR, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.3-8.8]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.008), WHO essential medicine status (essential mOR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2] vs nonessential mOR, 4.6 [95% CI, 3.2-6.7]; P\u2009=\u2009.02), and for brand-name vs generic status (brand-name mOR, 8.1 [95% CI, 4.0-16.0] vs generic mOR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]; P\u2009=\u2009.002).\nConclusions and Relevance\u00a0\r\n    In this national cross-sectional study, supply chain issues associated with drug shortages increased at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing policy work is needed to protect US drug supplies from future shocks and to prioritize clinically valuable drugs at greatest shortage risk.\nDrug shortages have reached record highs.1 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a shortage as \u201ca period of time when the demand\u2026for the drug\u2026exceeds the supply.\u201d2 Shortages have been associated with missed or delayed dosages,3,4 medication errors,5,6 increased spending,7,8 and death.9 Shortages are caused by underreimbursement,10 quality concerns,11 and an overreliance on single-source production.12\nSince 2012, companies must report to the FDA known issues affecting the supply chain which could result in shortages (hereafter, supply chain issue reports).2 These reports are also tracked by the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP).13 Examples of supply chain issue reports include quality concerns (eg, microbial contamination) and unanticipated events that may impact production (eg, natural disasters).14 The FDA also publishes recalls and discontinuations. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with record numbers of supply chain issue reports.1,15 Despite these known risks, it is unknown how often supply chain issues were associated with subsequent shortages, ie, meaningful decreases in the national supply of a medication.\nAs the public health emergency ends, there is an imperative need for evidence regarding its impact on the drug supply chain to inform policies16-20 that protect patients from future, unanticipated shocks.21 The primary objective of our study was to quantify the proportion of all supply chain issue reports that were associated with drug shortages from 2017 to 2021. Our study adds to existing literature by comparing shortages during vs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and by drug characteristics. Our results provide evidence to inform policies to manage upstream events before they impact patients\u2019 access to life-saving treatments.\nWe conducted a population-based, longitudinal cross-sectional study of US prescription drug purchases from January 2017 to December 2021. Using public information from the FDA and ASHP, we identified medications with supply chain issue reports and matched them to drugs without reports. We selected supply chain characteristics based on a conceptual framework and compared the odds of shortages for each group. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved the study as not human participants research; therefore, the requirements for approval and informed consent were waived. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.\nDrug manufacturers are legally required to report known supply chain issues which could result in shortages (eg, inability to obtain raw ingredients) to the FDA; they report voluntarily to ASHP. However, supply chain reports may be incomplete indicators for meaningful decreases in national supplies (ie, shortages). As represented in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1, protective shields in supply chains,22,23 including opening more production lines, importing drugs from other countries, lengthening expiration dates,14,22 or using residual supplies,22 may address issues prior to the depletion of supplies held by manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies. Therefore, not all reported issues necessarily result in drug shortages.\nGiven these complexities and the known limitations of reporting, the purpose of our study was to quantify the proportion of supply chain issue reports that were associated with subsequent population-level shortages, both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Because there is no legal standard for meaningful decreases in supply, we defined shortages as decreases in purchased units of at least 33% within 6 months after the issuance of a new supply chain issue report. This threshold was chosen based on previous studies24 and is consistent with the FDA and ASHP\u2019s definitions of shortages, ie, significant decreases in national supply2 with the greatest potential to impact patient care.25 We accounted for non\u2013shortage-related supply chain factors by matching drugs exposed to reports to unexposed drugs without reports. We then compared subsequent odds of shortages (ie, \u226533% decreases in supply) for each group.\nOur study population comprised a longitudinal cross-section of drugs purchased in the US from 2017 to 2021 in IQVIA\u2019s Multinational Integrated Data Analysis (MIDAS) database. MIDAS comprises 85% of retail and 97% of nonretail purchases by pharmacies from wholesalers and manufacturers, based on unit volume.26 Data are reported in standardized units, defined as 1 pill, capsule, or vial or 5 mL oral liquid. We conducted our analyses on the drug formulation level. We excluded products with incomplete data, radiopharmaceuticals, unapproved products, allergens, antidotes, and over-the-counter products that are not fully captured in MIDAS. We also excluded topicals, since these may reflect different dosages that are difficult to compare with systemic formulations (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).\nOur exposed group comprised drugs with incident supply chain issue reports issued from January 2017 to September 2021 (3 months prior to data end). For each report, we defined the index date as the initial posting date by the FDA or ASHP. This included issues reported as being likely to result in shortages,2,13,27,28 FDA recalls,29 and discontinuations. Reports for the same drug-form were considered the same episode if they occurred within 90 days (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding recalls and discontinuations which may be indefinite.30\nWe performed exposure density sampling (EDS) to match each drug with a supply chain issue report (ie, exposed) with up to 10 comparison drugs with no reports at the time of exposure (ie, nonexposed).31,32 EDS is akin to sampling techniques for nested case-control studies,32-34 with the exception that matching is performed at the time of an exposure instead of the time of an outcome. This approach mitigated bias due to seasonality. When appropriately combined with multivariable adjustment for confounders, EDS leads to unbiased results.32 We did not match on baseline purchasing trends, since many reports were precipitated by abnormal demand increases.35 Drugs could appear more than once in either group. Drugs with reports could serve as at-risk comparators during any month without an active supply issue report.33\nMotivated by FDA\u2019s definition2 and based on previous studies,24 we defined meaningful shortages as at least 33% decreases in purchased units within 6 months after an incident supply chain issue report, compared with 3 months prior (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). This decrease is greater than what would be expected based on seasonal trends. We conducted secondary analyses of severe shortages, defined as decreases of at least 66%, as in previous literature.24\nWe used random-effects logistic regression models followed by marginal estimation to compare the odds of shortages for drugs with vs without supply chain issue reports. We included a random intercept for each matched set to account for potential dependency induced by matching. Our main estimates were the mean marginal odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports.34,35 We estimated absolute incidence by comparing the estimated probabilities of shortages in each group. A type 1 error rate of .05 was assumed, all hypothesis tests were 2-sided, and no adjustments were made for multiplicity. Analyses were conducted from January to May 2023 in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute), Stata version 16.1 (StataCorp), and RStudio version 4.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing).\nTo determine the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with US drug supply shortages, we included interaction terms to assess differential changes in the odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports before the pandemic (January 2017 to January 2020), in the first few months after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an emergency and when stockpiling occurred36 (February 2020 to April 2020), and in the first pandemic year (May 2020 to September 2021). We grouped issues based on their issuance date.\nTo assess the associations of supply chain characteristics with shortage incidence, we included interaction terms by formulation. We then used marginal estimation to compare odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports, within each form, eg, parenteral drugs with reports vs parenteral comparators. Additional interaction terms were added for other characteristics, including years since market entry and generic availability from the FDA National Drug Code Directory (August 2022),37 WHO essential medicine status (June 2022),38 and clinician- vs self-administration, defined using J-codes.39 We proxied supply chain redundancy using the number of manufacturers in MIDAS in the 6 months prior to a supply chain issue report. To capture market size, we adjusted for total sales in MIDAS during the same period (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of methodological assumptions. Because some shortages take longer to develop (eg, due to residual supply), we redefined shortages as decreases in supply within 9 months after report issuance. We assessed 5 (vs 10) matched comparisons, FDA and ASHP reports separately, and excluded recalls and discontinuations.30 Finally, we used nearest-neighbor propensity score methods to match drugs on month, formulation, class, clinician- vs self-administration, WHO essential-medicine status, at least 20 years since market or generic availability, at least 5 manufacturers, and at least $5 million in sales.\nPrior to inclusion criteria, there were 4142 drugs. As shown in Figure 1, 2276 drugs met exclusion criteria, resulting in a final sample of 1866 drugs. Among these, 571 drugs (31%) had 731 incident supply chain issue reports. These were EDS-matched to 1597 unique drugs without concurrent exposures; 717 reports were matched to 10 comparators and 14 reports had 9 comparators, for a total sample size of 7296 comparators.\nPer the Table, generic drugs were overrepresented in supply chain issue reports (616 reports [84%] vs 4397 comparison drugs [60%]), as were products at least 20 years old (375 reports [51%] vs 2434 comparison drugs [33%]), drugs with at least 5 manufacturers (378 reports [52%] vs 2225 comparison drugs [30%]), WHO essential medicines (316 reports [43%] vs 2199 comparison drugs [30%]), and drugs with less than $5 million baseline sales (234 reports [32%] vs 2158 comparison drugs [30%]). Manufacturers did not provide a reason for 264 reports (36%); the percentage of reports with unknown or unspecified reasons increased to 42% from February to April 2020 and 47% after May 2020 (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Across the entire study period, more than half of reports were recalls or discontinuations (498 reports [68%]), mostly due to quality concerns (Table; eTable 4 in Supplement 1).\nWe observed 15 to 71 incident supply chain issue reports per quarter from 2017 to 2021 (Figure 2). Across the study period, the mean change in drug purchases was \u22125.1% (95% CI, \u22128.2% to \u22122.1%) in the first quarter and \u22127.0% (95% CI, \u221214.7 to 0.01%) in the second quarter after report-issuance (Table). Among all reports, 113 reports (16%) were associated with shortages (\u226533% decrease) within 6 months vs 491 of 7290 unexposed comparison drugs (7%) (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). We observed an increase in comparison drugs with shortages in the first quarter of 2020 (Figure 2). Severe shortages (\u226566% decrease) were less common, with 63 reports (9%) and 188 comparison drugs (3%) associated with severe shortages (eTable 5, eFigure 4, and eFigure 5 in Supplement 1). Nonrecall and nondiscontinuation reports were more likely to be associated with meaningful (83 reports [23%]) and severe (43 reports [12%]) shortages, compared with recalls (meaningful: 13 reports [10%]; severe: 4 reports [3%]) and discontinuations (meaningful: 48 reports [13%]; severe: 33 reports [9%]) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1).\nMarginal odds ratios (mORs) and estimated probabilities from our logistic regression analysis are shown in Figure 3, with full regression output in eTable 6 in Supplement 1. Across baseline drug characteristics, the marginal estimated percentage of supply chain issue reports associated with shortages was 13.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-17.8%) of reports vs 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.8%) of comparators (Figure 3). Compared with drugs without reports, drugs with reports had greater marginal odds of shortages (mOR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.9-5.1]). Results were similar for severe shortages (mOR, 6.3 [95% CI, 3.7-10.9]), although adjusted incidences were lower (6.0% [95% CI, 3.8%-9.2%] for supply chain issue reports and 1.0% [95% CI, 0.7%-1.4%] for comparison drugs) (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).\nAs shown in Figure 3, the adjusted incidence of shortages for supply chain reports issued in the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be associated with subsequent shortages than reports issued during the prepandemic period (34.2% [95% CI, 18.6%-54.1%] vs 13.7% [95% CI, 10.0%-18.5%]). However, we also observed increases in the adjusted proportion of comparison drugs without reports with shortages at or above our 33% cutoff compared with the prepandemic period (9.5% [95% CI, 7.2%-12.5%] vs 4.0% [95% CI, 3.3%-4.7%]). There were no significant interactions by COVID-19 pandemic period. The 95% CIs of the mORs comparing drugs with vs without reports issued from February to April 2020 overlapped with the prepandemic period (prepandemic mOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.6-5.6] vs February to April 2020 mOR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.1-11.6]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.60). The mOR for drugs with vs without reports issued during or after May 2020 also did not significantly differ from the prepandemic period (mOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6-5.3]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.38) (Figure 3). The association between report status and severe shortages did not significantly differ during the prepandemic period (mOR, 6.8 [95% CI, 3.6-12.4]) vs during the early stage of the pandemic (February to April 2020: mOR, 5.9 [95% CI, 1.3-26.3]) or after May 2020 (mOR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.4-11.8]) (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).\nFigure 4 summarizes our assessment of heterogeneity by drug characteristics. Across other characteristics, we observed a significant interaction for parenteral drugs with vs without reports, compared with oral drugs (parenteral mOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.2] vs oral mOR, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.3-8.8]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.008). There were also significant interactions by WHO essential medicine status (essential mOR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2] vs nonessential mOR, 4.6 [95% CI, 3.2-6.7]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.02), and for brand-name vs generic drugs (brand-name mOR, 8.1 [95% CI, 4.0-16.0] vs generic mOR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.002). We observed similar heterogeneity for severe shortages  (eFigure 7 in Supplement 1).\nAs shown in eFigure 8 and eTables 7 to 11 in Supplement 1, sensitivity analyses were consistent with our main findings. Excluding recalls and discontinuations resulted in a slightly higher adjusted incidence of shortages (16.7% [95% CI, 12.9%-21.4%]); however, the marginal odds of shortage were similar (mOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-5.4]).\nIn this national cross-sectional study, approximately 1 in 7 supply chain issue reports (14%) were associated with drug shortages within 6 months, and 1 in 15 supply chain issue reports (6%) were associated with severe shortages. The incidence of shortages increased to 1 in 3 reports (34%) from February to April 2020 and then reduced to prepandemic levels after May 2020. However, we also observed increases in shortages in drugs with no supply chain issues during the early pandemic. WHO essential and parenteral medicines were less likely to be associated with shortages, and brand name drugs were more likely to be associated with shortages.\nOur findings are mostly consistent with a similar RAND study in MIDAS from 2016 to 2019.30 In that study, utilization decreased by a mean of 8.4% in the quarter after a supply chain issue report vs 5.1% in our study. Our smaller absolute estimate may be due to a lower incidence of shortages after May 2020. Nevertheless, our study is an important contribution to the literature because we included recalls and discontinuations, which were less likely to be associated with shortages. We also tested whether shortages changed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn our study, drugs with and without reports from February to April 2020 were more likely to be associated with subsequent shortages, compared with prepandemic rates. These findings are consistent with the known destabilizing impact of COVID-19 on supply chains. We observed a return to prepandemic levels after May 2020. This finding may be explained by the implementation of new policies that empowered the FDA to take more direct action.16,40,41 Despite these improvements, ongoing vulnerabilities in drug supply chains are in need of policy action,17 including greater supply chain transparency19,21 and addressing root economic causes of shortages.42\nIt is also possible that issuance of an FDA or ASHP report, while consistently associated with higher odds of shortages, may have underestimated relevant upstream issues at pandemic start. Before the pandemic, 4% of drugs with no report were associated with shortages at or above our 33% decrease cutoff; this increased to 10% from February to April 2020. We also observed a greater proportion of supply chain issues with no or unspecified reasons during the pandemic vs the prepandemic period. Temporary pauses in quality assurance reviews during COVID-19 lockdowns may have been associated with underreporting. There are no penalties for failure to report.22 Our wide 95% CIs for February to April 2020 should be interpreted with caution, given the small sample size (57 reports) and potential underreporting.\nWhen examining variation across drugs, we observed a higher mOR for the association between having a report and subsequent shortage among branded medications. This finding is not unexpected, given that branded markets usually have 1 supplier. The higher mOR among branded medications may therefore be explained by the unavailability of alternative manufacturers to supply product. Shortages of branded drugs may also respond to different underlying reasons, such as increased demand, quotas, or manufacturer capacity.43,44 In contrast, approximately 4 in 5 supply chain issue reports in our study were for generic medications, and one-third were for drugs with prereport sales less than $5 million. Generic supply chain issues likely involve insufficient incentives for manufacturers to invest in resilient supply chains for products of limited profitability.11,41 In this context, recent policy proposals suggest the implementation of reimbursement models which would provide add-on payments for generics manufactured in more resilient supply chains.42,45 Our findings of differing shortage risk by supply chain characteristics could be used to develop lists of high-priority generic drugs for the application of these novel reimbursement models. Our findings may also be informative for the development of shortage-critical lists to prioritize medications for other drug shortage policies,22,46 like those in Canada and Europe.47,48 Similar frameworks have not yet been adopted in the US but would be useful in the prioritization of national drug shortage policy.49\nInterestingly, we observed a lower mOR for the association between having a report and subsequent shortage for parenteral vs oral drugs. Changes in demand for these products, eg, cancellation of elective surgeries, may have resulted in residual supply during the pandemic. A higher proportion of parenteral drugs without supply chain reports were also associated with meaningful decreases in supply at or above our 33% cutoff, eg, 7% of parenteral vs 3% of oral drugs, suggesting that it is also possible all parenteral products were more vulnerable to disruption, lessening the difference between exposed vs unexposed drugs.11,41 Generic sterile injectables have therefore been prioritized in several recent drug shortage policy proposals.42,45\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the observed increase in drugs without supply chain issue reports that experienced shortages from February to April 2020 suggests potential for underreporting during the COVID-19 shutdown. Our mORs comparing drugs with vs without reports from February to April 2020 should be interpreted with caution. Our dataset was also time-limited (2017-2021). Many pandemic-related policies were not yet fully implemented, and we could not assess the association of the end of the public health emergency in May 2023.50 Second, although MIDAS is the most comprehensive dataset available, it does not fully capture over-the-counter and topical products, many of which have recently been experiencing shortages. Third, we do not know the downstream impact of the identified shortages on patients. Bedside efforts and availability of therapeutic alternatives may maintain standards of care, even when shortages occur.22 ASHP includes information on equivalents for some drugs; however, this information was lacking in FDA databases.\nThis cross-sectional study found that 1 in 7 supply chain issue reports were associated with drug shortages. Although the shortages increased early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a return to prepandemic levels after May 2020. As the public health emergency ends, continued policy effort is needed to mitigate shortages and to prepare pharmaceutical supply chains for future, unanticipated shocks.\nAccepted for Publication: January 29, 2024.\nPublished: April 5, 2024. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.4246\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2024 Callaway Kim K et al.

      "Drug Shortages Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic\nChristina M. Bookwalter, PharmD, BCPSClinical PharmacistWomack Army Medical CenterFort Bragg, North Carolina\n\nUS Pharm. 2021;46(2):25-28.\nABSTRACT: The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused anticipatory purchasing of medications around the world, driving demand to an unprecedented high. Meanwhile, drug factories shut down in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the drug-supply chain was disrupted, and drug shortages resulted. In the face of these drug shortages, pharmacy personnel responded by initiating local policy changes, implementing detailed antibiotic stewardship, and enacting quantity limits for in-demand medications. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s a shortage of everything\u2019: Pharmacies in New York City struggle to keep key medications stocked amid coronavirus outbreak.\u201d1 \u201cCoronavirus pandemic is causing \u2018unacceptable\u2019 shortages in US drug supplies.\u201d2 These headlines and many others have overwhelmed news outlets, social media, and general conversation among the American public for months. When pharmacy personnel hear about drug shortages, panic, fear, and frustration begin to set in. Pharmacy\u2019s primary responsibility is to supply patients with life-saving medications. When drugs run out, pharmacy personnel may feel responsible for failing to supply the patient with a life-saving pharmaceutical. Accordingly, when pharmacy professionals encounter drug shortages, there is a call to action to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by purchasing available product, looking for alternatives, implementing protocols to save stock, and finding creative solutions to conserve valuable resources. The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the difficulties inherent in having a global drug-supply chain and has caused an increase in global demand for certain medications. It is imperative for pharmacists to understand the causes of drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, key medications affected at this time, and how to ensure patient safety during a shortage.\nCauses of Drug Shortages\nDrug shortages have been an ongoing problem for the medical community for decades; however, drug-shortage concerns have been exacerbated by this worldwide pandemic. Drug manufacturing follows standard business practices in order to make a profit. Excess stock in the warehouse is risky from a business standpoint. It costs money to store and maintain product in anticipation of sales and profit. Therefore, businesses may operate on a just-in-time model by manufacturing the product when it is needed in order to keep costs down and maintain efficiency. With no on-hand reserve, if anything alters supply or increases demand, a shortage can occur.3\nThe supply of goods to the market directly relates to the quantity of goods coming off the production lines over a given time. In order to produce a drug, raw materials must be acquired. The drug-manufacturing process is wholly dependent on the supplier of the raw materials. Often, there are multiple manufacturers for a drug, but there may be only one producer of the raw material. Therefore, any interruption in the supply of the raw material will affect all manufacturers of the drug.4 Currently, about 80% of the raw materials for drugs are imported from abroad, making the American drug supply highly dependent on other countries.4\nEven when adequate raw materials are available, there is a maximum capacity or a limited number of units that can be manufactured at a given time. Because the FDA approves a specific manufacturing line to produce a specific drug at a specific facility, a manufacturer cannot set up additional production of a drug in short supply elsewhere in the facility.4 Further limitations to production include the good manufacturing practices, chemical reactions, and in-process controls that must be in place to turn out a quality product.5\nThe spread of COVID-19 to the level of a global pandemic impacted the acquisition of raw material and caused manufacturing shutdowns around the world. China is a major source of active pharmaceutical ingredients, finished dosage forms, and raw materials.6 In response to COVID-19, roughly 37 pharmaceutical factories in China that manufactured active ingredients for U.S. drug products were shut down.7 Consequently, manufacturers in other parts of the world were forced to depend on current stock or find alternative supply sources. India, which imports roughly 70% of its raw materials from China and is the world\u2019s largest producer of generic drugs, began to experience delays in receiving ingredients and could not keep up with global demand under these conditions.7 In anticipation of drug shortages, the Indian government restricted the exportation of medications to other parts of the world in order to prevent a potential shortage in its own country.7 The limiting of drug exports from India amplified shortages in other areas of the world that depend on that supply.\nWith factory doors closed and COVID-19 a global threat, supplies start to run low. Not knowing when and where the next COVID-19 surge will occur, everyone is trying to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by managing the inventory of critical drugs required for providers to adequately treat the virus. As soon as evidence surfaces to support a potential treatment, pharmacies begin procuring the drug, and global demand starts to increase. Some drugs that have been in high demand in association with COVID-19 include albuterol metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and sedation medications.\nDrugs in Demand for COVID-19 Treatment\nAlbuterol MDIs: Treatment of COVID-19 often involves the use of bronchodilators owing to the specific lung cells targeted by the virus. Given that nebulizers increase the generation of aerosolized virus in COVID-19 patients and potentially escalate the spread of the virus, MDI use is preferred. Inhaler shortages are occurring because of increased demand by hospitals for treatment of COVID-19.8 To combat potential shortages, hospitals can conserve supply by creating local policies that would allow patients to bring their inhaler supply from home to use during their inpatient stay.9 Another way to conserve supply is when an inpatient pharmacy dispenses an inhaler for hospital use, then gives it to the patient upon discharge, eliminating the need for the patient to obtain a new prescription from the outpatient pharmacy.9 The possibility of using one MDI for multiple patients has been discussed. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) currently recommends against a common MDI-canister protocol.9 Common canister protocol involves using the same MDI for multiple patients by disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece with an alcohol pad before inserting it into a patient-specific spacer with a one-way valve, administering the medication, and disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece after use.9 Studies have found rates of bacterial contamination on the disinfected mouthpiece of up to 5%.9 The ISMP states that using a common canister for patients on isolation or those who are immunocompromised may not be appropriate and that the methods in previous studies have been aimed at preventing bacterial contamination, which would not be applicable to COVID-19.9 Given the elevated demand for MDIs because of COVID-19, it is imperative that pharmacists consider their current inventory and plan to conserve supplies if needed.\nAzithromycin: Azithromycin has been used as adjunctive therapy to provide antibacterial coverage and potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of some viral respiratory tract infections.10 Many trials are testing the effect of azithromycin in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.10 The increasing number of reports on azithromycin has led to an increased demand for the drug. On April 14, 2020, the FDA reported that there was currently a shortage of azithromycin owing to high demand.11 Although the intention to acquire supplies to keep on hand in case of a COVID-19 surge is laudable, it is important to remember that in 2018 the United States dispensed 38.5 million azithromycin prescriptions for conditions other than COVID-19.12 In order to reserve a supply of azithromycin, it is imperative that pharmacists practice good antibiotic stewardship and ensure that patients who receive azithromycin have an appropriate indication. In the U.S. alone, the CDC estimates that at least 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, commonly being written for viral respiratory infections when therapy is not indicated.13 Some other examples of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing include the use of non\u2013first-line antibiotics and the use of an antibiotic with excessively broad-spectrum activity for which a narrow-spectrum drug could be substituted.13 Pharmacists should review all azithromycin prescriptions to ensure that there is a proper indication and, when appropriate, recommend other proven therapy alternatives in order to help conserve the azithromycin supply.\nHydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are indicated for a very small population of patients with uncommon conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria. Therefore, typical purchasing quantities are minimal. However, COVID-19 research involving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has heightened the demand for these drugs. Many small trials began testing the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients because their mechanisms of action include targeting of lysosome, which can control graft-versus-host disease; inhibition of entry of the virus; prevention of virus cell fusion; anti-inflammatory effects; and reduction of cytokine storm.10 On March 20, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile to be used by licensed healthcare providers to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19.14 An analysis of outpatient retail pharmacy transaction data found that the prescribing of these drugs increased from 383,435 prescriptions in February 2020 to 759,186 prescriptions in March 2020.14 With demand doubling over 1 month, shortages followed, and the FDA published information on the shortages on March 31, 2020.15 In response, certain state boards of pharmacy established new rules to control use by requiring a diagnosis for the indicated disease to be written on the prescription, placing quantity limits for COVID-19 prescriptions, and restricting refills.16 On June 15, 2020, the FDA rescinded its EUA because the federal COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 and noted that, at the time, no medication could be recommended for COVID-19 preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis outside the clinical-trial setting.14 Following the release of this information, dispensing trends began to return to prepandemic levels, and the shortage resolved in late June 2020.14\nSedation Medications: COVID-19 can result in acute respiratory distress, and in extreme cases it requires the use of mechanical ventilation. Anticipation of an increase in mechanically ventilated patients and heightened demand for analgesics, sedatives, and paralytics created the perfect conditions for drug shortages. One way to save drug product is to minimize waste. Inpatient pharmacies should consider purchasing or compounding smaller drug volumes, when applicable, in order to minimize waste. Pharmacists should also review current hospital protocols and work with key stakeholders to make contingency plans for shortages of sedation medications. Traditionally, IV administration of opioids is preferred in mechanically ventilated patients; however, to conserve resources and keep opioid use to a minimum, hospitals can establish protocols for intermittent bolus analgesia, enteral administration of opioids, or implementation of adjuvant therapies.17 In ventilated patients, light sedation\u2014which helps conserve drug supply\u2014is preferred over deep sedation.17 Nonbenzodiazepine sedatives such as propofol and dexmedetomidine are preferred, but contingencies should be put in place to use other agents, such as ketamine, benzodiazepines, and pentobarbital.17 Awakening trials with reassessment of sedation needs should be performed daily. This practice may result in a reduction in sedation requirements while effectively conserving drug supply.17 In addition to analgesics and sedatives, some patients with COVID-19 will require paralytics. In order to conserve resources, hospital guidelines should be established for the use of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus use of paralytic agents.17 In general, when a drug shortage arises, it is imperative that pharmacists familiarize themselves with all alternative products and assist in creating contingency plans.\nPatient Safety During a Drug Shortage\nA drug shortage commonly requires the substitution of an item that is ordered, prepared, or dispensed differently than the standard product. When prescribing practices switch to less-familiar alternative agents\u2014especially those that are less efficacious, have a worse adverse-effect profile, or require an unusual or difficult dosing regimen\u2014medication errors are more likely to occur.18 To minimize medication errors and maximize patient safety, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines on managing drug-product shortages recommend implementing a drug-product shortage team, creating a resource-allocation committee, and establishing a process for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations.18 The product-shortage team would have multiple responsibilities, including the purchasing of alternative agents, decisions on conserving or rationing supplies, implementation of technology updates, and communication of changes.18 The resource-allocation committee would create a framework for rationing drug resources in advance, thereby eliminating the need for bedside decisions during a shortage.18 The final ASHP recommendation is to have a process in place for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations. A multidisciplinary team would be responsible for establishing ethical procedures and protocols before they are needed in order to ensure that the rationing of life-saving drugs reflects the fundamental healthcare principles of justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence.18\nThe overarching recommendation for preventing medication errors and ensuring patient safety is to focus on communicating information about the drug shortage. Communication updates should include all pertinent information about the shortage, such as the drug affected and the substitution or rationing plan.18 If a new drug is being selected, educational references about prescribing differences should be distributed, and pharmacists should be prepared to answer questions about the new agent. When information is being disseminated, it is important to include all potential stakeholders across all shifts. With drug shortages on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that the pharmacy profession take a proactive leadership role in developing and implementing processes to address drug shortages and ensure patient safety.\nConclusion\nThe pharmacy profession has been dealing with drug shortages for years. However, no past experience could have adequately prepared pharmacists for the drug shortages and unprecedented high demand resulting from the extensive disruptions caused by COVID-19. The pandemic crippled the global drug-supply chain by leading to factory closings, limited access to raw materials, and altered import and export rates of final dosage forms. With an inadequate supply chain and high demand worldwide, prescription drug shortages became a common topic in the pharmacy realm. Fear of not having enough supplies to battle the virus motivated pharmacy personnel to change current practices by initiating local policy changes, focusing on antibiotic stewardship, and implementing quantity limits in order to conserve drug stock. Overall, the need to combat historic drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to innovation and critical thinking in an effort to conserve valuable supplies without sacrificing patient safety under less-than-ideal circumstances. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\nREFERENCES\n1.

      "Drug Shortages Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic\nChristina M. Bookwalter, PharmD, BCPSClinical PharmacistWomack Army Medical CenterFort Bragg, North Carolina\n\nUS Pharm. 2021;46(2):25-28.\nABSTRACT: The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused anticipatory purchasing of medications around the world, driving demand to an unprecedented high. Meanwhile, drug factories shut down in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the drug-supply chain was disrupted, and drug shortages resulted. In the face of these drug shortages, pharmacy personnel responded by initiating local policy changes, implementing detailed antibiotic stewardship, and enacting quantity limits for in-demand medications. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s a shortage of everything\u2019: Pharmacies in New York City struggle to keep key medications stocked amid coronavirus outbreak.\u201d1 \u201cCoronavirus pandemic is causing \u2018unacceptable\u2019 shortages in US drug supplies.\u201d2 These headlines and many others have overwhelmed news outlets, social media, and general conversation among the American public for months. When pharmacy personnel hear about drug shortages, panic, fear, and frustration begin to set in. Pharmacy\u2019s primary responsibility is to supply patients with life-saving medications. When drugs run out, pharmacy personnel may feel responsible for failing to supply the patient with a life-saving pharmaceutical. Accordingly, when pharmacy professionals encounter drug shortages, there is a call to action to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by purchasing available product, looking for alternatives, implementing protocols to save stock, and finding creative solutions to conserve valuable resources. The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the difficulties inherent in having a global drug-supply chain and has caused an increase in global demand for certain medications. It is imperative for pharmacists to understand the causes of drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, key medications affected at this time, and how to ensure patient safety during a shortage.\nCauses of Drug Shortages\nDrug shortages have been an ongoing problem for the medical community for decades; however, drug-shortage concerns have been exacerbated by this worldwide pandemic. Drug manufacturing follows standard business practices in order to make a profit. Excess stock in the warehouse is risky from a business standpoint. It costs money to store and maintain product in anticipation of sales and profit. Therefore, businesses may operate on a just-in-time model by manufacturing the product when it is needed in order to keep costs down and maintain efficiency. With no on-hand reserve, if anything alters supply or increases demand, a shortage can occur.3\nThe supply of goods to the market directly relates to the quantity of goods coming off the production lines over a given time. In order to produce a drug, raw materials must be acquired. The drug-manufacturing process is wholly dependent on the supplier of the raw materials. Often, there are multiple manufacturers for a drug, but there may be only one producer of the raw material. Therefore, any interruption in the supply of the raw material will affect all manufacturers of the drug.4 Currently, about 80% of the raw materials for drugs are imported from abroad, making the American drug supply highly dependent on other countries.4\nEven when adequate raw materials are available, there is a maximum capacity or a limited number of units that can be manufactured at a given time. Because the FDA approves a specific manufacturing line to produce a specific drug at a specific facility, a manufacturer cannot set up additional production of a drug in short supply elsewhere in the facility.4 Further limitations to production include the good manufacturing practices, chemical reactions, and in-process controls that must be in place to turn out a quality product.5\nThe spread of COVID-19 to the level of a global pandemic impacted the acquisition of raw material and caused manufacturing shutdowns around the world. China is a major source of active pharmaceutical ingredients, finished dosage forms, and raw materials.6 In response to COVID-19, roughly 37 pharmaceutical factories in China that manufactured active ingredients for U.S. drug products were shut down.7 Consequently, manufacturers in other parts of the world were forced to depend on current stock or find alternative supply sources. India, which imports roughly 70% of its raw materials from China and is the world\u2019s largest producer of generic drugs, began to experience delays in receiving ingredients and could not keep up with global demand under these conditions.7 In anticipation of drug shortages, the Indian government restricted the exportation of medications to other parts of the world in order to prevent a potential shortage in its own country.7 The limiting of drug exports from India amplified shortages in other areas of the world that depend on that supply.\nWith factory doors closed and COVID-19 a global threat, supplies start to run low. Not knowing when and where the next COVID-19 surge will occur, everyone is trying to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by managing the inventory of critical drugs required for providers to adequately treat the virus. As soon as evidence surfaces to support a potential treatment, pharmacies begin procuring the drug, and global demand starts to increase. Some drugs that have been in high demand in association with COVID-19 include albuterol metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and sedation medications.\nDrugs in Demand for COVID-19 Treatment\nAlbuterol MDIs: Treatment of COVID-19 often involves the use of bronchodilators owing to the specific lung cells targeted by the virus. Given that nebulizers increase the generation of aerosolized virus in COVID-19 patients and potentially escalate the spread of the virus, MDI use is preferred. Inhaler shortages are occurring because of increased demand by hospitals for treatment of COVID-19.8 To combat potential shortages, hospitals can conserve supply by creating local policies that would allow patients to bring their inhaler supply from home to use during their inpatient stay.9 Another way to conserve supply is when an inpatient pharmacy dispenses an inhaler for hospital use, then gives it to the patient upon discharge, eliminating the need for the patient to obtain a new prescription from the outpatient pharmacy.9 The possibility of using one MDI for multiple patients has been discussed. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) currently recommends against a common MDI-canister protocol.9 Common canister protocol involves using the same MDI for multiple patients by disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece with an alcohol pad before inserting it into a patient-specific spacer with a one-way valve, administering the medication, and disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece after use.9 Studies have found rates of bacterial contamination on the disinfected mouthpiece of up to 5%.9 The ISMP states that using a common canister for patients on isolation or those who are immunocompromised may not be appropriate and that the methods in previous studies have been aimed at preventing bacterial contamination, which would not be applicable to COVID-19.9 Given the elevated demand for MDIs because of COVID-19, it is imperative that pharmacists consider their current inventory and plan to conserve supplies if needed.\nAzithromycin: Azithromycin has been used as adjunctive therapy to provide antibacterial coverage and potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of some viral respiratory tract infections.10 Many trials are testing the effect of azithromycin in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.10 The increasing number of reports on azithromycin has led to an increased demand for the drug. On April 14, 2020, the FDA reported that there was currently a shortage of azithromycin owing to high demand.11 Although the intention to acquire supplies to keep on hand in case of a COVID-19 surge is laudable, it is important to remember that in 2018 the United States dispensed 38.5 million azithromycin prescriptions for conditions other than COVID-19.12 In order to reserve a supply of azithromycin, it is imperative that pharmacists practice good antibiotic stewardship and ensure that patients who receive azithromycin have an appropriate indication. In the U.S. alone, the CDC estimates that at least 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, commonly being written for viral respiratory infections when therapy is not indicated.13 Some other examples of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing include the use of non\u2013first-line antibiotics and the use of an antibiotic with excessively broad-spectrum activity for which a narrow-spectrum drug could be substituted.13 Pharmacists should review all azithromycin prescriptions to ensure that there is a proper indication and, when appropriate, recommend other proven therapy alternatives in order to help conserve the azithromycin supply.\nHydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are indicated for a very small population of patients with uncommon conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria. Therefore, typical purchasing quantities are minimal. However, COVID-19 research involving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has heightened the demand for these drugs. Many small trials began testing the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients because their mechanisms of action include targeting of lysosome, which can control graft-versus-host disease; inhibition of entry of the virus; prevention of virus cell fusion; anti-inflammatory effects; and reduction of cytokine storm.10 On March 20, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile to be used by licensed healthcare providers to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19.14 An analysis of outpatient retail pharmacy transaction data found that the prescribing of these drugs increased from 383,435 prescriptions in February 2020 to 759,186 prescriptions in March 2020.14 With demand doubling over 1 month, shortages followed, and the FDA published information on the shortages on March 31, 2020.15 In response, certain state boards of pharmacy established new rules to control use by requiring a diagnosis for the indicated disease to be written on the prescription, placing quantity limits for COVID-19 prescriptions, and restricting refills.16 On June 15, 2020, the FDA rescinded its EUA because the federal COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 and noted that, at the time, no medication could be recommended for COVID-19 preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis outside the clinical-trial setting.14 Following the release of this information, dispensing trends began to return to prepandemic levels, and the shortage resolved in late June 2020.14\nSedation Medications: COVID-19 can result in acute respiratory distress, and in extreme cases it requires the use of mechanical ventilation. Anticipation of an increase in mechanically ventilated patients and heightened demand for analgesics, sedatives, and paralytics created the perfect conditions for drug shortages. One way to save drug product is to minimize waste. Inpatient pharmacies should consider purchasing or compounding smaller drug volumes, when applicable, in order to minimize waste. Pharmacists should also review current hospital protocols and work with key stakeholders to make contingency plans for shortages of sedation medications. Traditionally, IV administration of opioids is preferred in mechanically ventilated patients; however, to conserve resources and keep opioid use to a minimum, hospitals can establish protocols for intermittent bolus analgesia, enteral administration of opioids, or implementation of adjuvant therapies.17 In ventilated patients, light sedation\u2014which helps conserve drug supply\u2014is preferred over deep sedation.17 Nonbenzodiazepine sedatives such as propofol and dexmedetomidine are preferred, but contingencies should be put in place to use other agents, such as ketamine, benzodiazepines, and pentobarbital.17 Awakening trials with reassessment of sedation needs should be performed daily. This practice may result in a reduction in sedation requirements while effectively conserving drug supply.17 In addition to analgesics and sedatives, some patients with COVID-19 will require paralytics. In order to conserve resources, hospital guidelines should be established for the use of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus use of paralytic agents.17 In general, when a drug shortage arises, it is imperative that pharmacists familiarize themselves with all alternative products and assist in creating contingency plans.\nPatient Safety During a Drug Shortage\nA drug shortage commonly requires the substitution of an item that is ordered, prepared, or dispensed differently than the standard product. When prescribing practices switch to less-familiar alternative agents\u2014especially those that are less efficacious, have a worse adverse-effect profile, or require an unusual or difficult dosing regimen\u2014medication errors are more likely to occur.18 To minimize medication errors and maximize patient safety, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines on managing drug-product shortages recommend implementing a drug-product shortage team, creating a resource-allocation committee, and establishing a process for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations.18 The product-shortage team would have multiple responsibilities, including the purchasing of alternative agents, decisions on conserving or rationing supplies, implementation of technology updates, and communication of changes.18 The resource-allocation committee would create a framework for rationing drug resources in advance, thereby eliminating the need for bedside decisions during a shortage.18 The final ASHP recommendation is to have a process in place for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations. A multidisciplinary team would be responsible for establishing ethical procedures and protocols before they are needed in order to ensure that the rationing of life-saving drugs reflects the fundamental healthcare principles of justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence.18\nThe overarching recommendation for preventing medication errors and ensuring patient safety is to focus on communicating information about the drug shortage. Communication updates should include all pertinent information about the shortage, such as the drug affected and the substitution or rationing plan.18 If a new drug is being selected, educational references about prescribing differences should be distributed, and pharmacists should be prepared to answer questions about the new agent. When information is being disseminated, it is important to include all potential stakeholders across all shifts. With drug shortages on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that the pharmacy profession take a proactive leadership role in developing and implementing processes to address drug shortages and ensure patient safety.\nConclusion\nThe pharmacy profession has been dealing with drug shortages for years. However, no past experience could have adequately prepared pharmacists for the drug shortages and unprecedented high demand resulting from the extensive disruptions caused by COVID-19. The pandemic crippled the global drug-supply chain by leading to factory closings, limited access to raw materials, and altered import and export rates of final dosage forms. With an inadequate supply chain and high demand worldwide, prescription drug shortages became a common topic in the pharmacy realm. Fear of not having enough supplies to battle the virus motivated pharmacy personnel to change current practices by initiating local policy changes, focusing on antibiotic stewardship, and implementing quantity limits in order to conserve drug stock. Overall, the need to combat historic drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to innovation and critical thinking in an effort to conserve valuable supplies without sacrificing patient safety under less-than-ideal circumstances. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\nREFERENCES\n1.

      "Breaking Down the Drug Shortages of 2024\nContent\nThe landscape of healthcare in the United States often feels as intricate and complicated as the human body itself. In recent times, one of the greatest challenges stirring concern among professionals and patients alike has been the drug shortages of 2024. These shortages have broad-reaching implications, affecting everything from the supply chain management of pharmaceuticals to the availability of lifesaving, critical drugs for patients in need.\nDrug shortages can sound somewhat of a vague issue until we consider the direct and often critical impact on patient\u2019s lives. From vital chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients to essential medications for hyperactivity disorder, the landscape of drug availability has shifted dramatically in 2024, sparking widespread concern and calls for swift action.\nFor updated information on the drug shortage crisis, including the reason for the shortage, availability of products, and estimation of resupply, view the ASHP list or the FDA database.\n\nThe landscape of healthcare in the United States often feels as intricate and complicated as the human body itself.

After all, why would a country as powerful as the United States struggle with such a basic need? The answer, unfortunately, is not straightforward but is intertwined with a network of intricate factors involving not only the production and distribution of drugs but also economic, political, and regulatory elements.\nSupply Chain Vulnerabilities\nOne major element contributing to the drug shortage crisis is the vulnerabilities in the supply chain. Often, drugs and their raw materials are sourced and processed in different countries \u2013 a complex tapestry that can be easily disrupted by a range of factors, from natural disasters affecting raw material supplies to political instabilities and even global pandemics.\nThe contracting practices between drug wholesalers and manufacturers, which often prioritize high-value drugs over lower-cost generic ones\u2014those most at risk of shortage\u2014contribute to the problem. This bias for profitability over sustainability can leave the supply of lower-cost generic drugs, essential medicines for a large fraction of the U.S. population, teetering on the edge.\nMarket Forces\nMarket forces also play a critical role. Some drug manufacturers may opt to discontinue production of less profitable drugs, leading to shortages. In an industry driven by profit margins, these decisions can have a domino effect, causing shortages that ripple across the country.\nQuality Concerns for Generic Drugs\nFinally, there are quality issues to consider within drug production. This aspect focuses on challenges faced by generic manufacturers. Increasing amounts of generic drugs have been recalled due to quality concerns, fueling the shortage. Alarmingly, popular medications like Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate, a drug used to treat ADHD, have come under scrutiny, further exaggerating the crisis.\nIn this intricate web of causes, one thing is clear: the drug shortages of 2024 are a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to resolution. Understanding these causes is the first step toward finding sustainable solutions.\n\nAt first glance, the shortage of prescription drugs may be challenging to understand.

Understanding these causes is the first step toward finding sustainable solutions.\nImplications of the Drug Shortages\nAs we delve into the aftermath of drug shortages, we cannot overlook the strain they place on both healthcare providers and patients. The conditions that arise from shortage situations are far-reaching and directly impact the quality of care.\nAn active drug shortage implies that there are limitations on what is available for patient treatment. In some situations, alternatives exist, but they may not have the same efficacy as the initially intended medication. Also, alternative drugs may come with a higher risk of side effects, putting an additional strain on the patient\u2019s health.\nPublic comments and white papers have been increasingly filled with stories reflecting this crisis. Instances of parents unable to find ADHD medications for their children, or families of cancer patients scrambling to find equally effective alternatives for unavailable emergency medications like chemotherapy drugs, are becoming deeply unsettling realities of the crisis.\nThe response of the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal agencies provides a sobering reflection of the severity of the situation. Given the complexity of these active shortages, federal bodies are grappling with formulating strategies to tackle the issue, with a focus on increasing generic drug production and bolstering the capacity of manufacturing chains.\nIn this light, the drug shortages of 2024 are not just numbers on spreadsheets and inventory lists. They represent a perilous reality for patients and healthcare providers across the United States. Exploring potential solutions, therefore, is not just a matter of balanced books\u2014it is a matter of life and health.\n\nAs we delve into the aftermath of drug shortages, we cannot overlook the strain they place on both healthcare providers and patients.

However, by taking systematic, strategic steps, it is possible to grapple with this issue effectively. Here are a few essential strategies being proposed to address and improve the drug shortage situation:\n1. Imposing Financial Penalties\nSome suggest leveraging financial penalties for delays in drug administration. This measure is believed to infuse a sense of responsibility and urgency within drug companies and discourage them from delay tactics that can exacerbate medical supplies shortage situations.\n2. Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience\nThe essence of this strategy lies in the diversification and reinforcement of the supply chain. This can be achieved through increased domestic manufacturing capabilities and a diversified global supply chain for key drug components. It is a tall order, requiring international cooperation, but it stands as a promising recourse for buffering against supply chain disruptions.\n3. Building a Robust Drug Shortage Database\nThe development of a comprehensive, up-to-date database on current and potential drug shortages is another crucial step towards mitigation. With access to real-time data, healthcare providers can anticipate supply issues, adjust inventories, and modify treatment plans, as necessary.\n4. Overhauling Contracting Practices\nThere is an emerging call to reassess contracting mechanisms within the pharmaceutical industry. Some contracts prioritize high-cost drugs over lower-cost generic ones\u2014a practice that needs to be revisited to ensure a stable supply of essential generic medications, most susceptible to shortages.\nIn summary, these proposed strategies represent a multi-pronged approach to tackling drug shortages\u2014a combination of regulatory measures, strategic overhauls, and technological solutions. By adopting such an approach, it opens the possibility of mitigating future drug shortages, ensuring that essential medications remain readily available to those who need them the most.\n\nNavigating through the complexities of drug supply shortages might seem daunting at first.

      "International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products Statistics Explained Source : Statistics Explained (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statisticsexplained/) - 15/11/2024 1 Data from April 2024 Planned article update: April 2025 \" In 2023 compared with 2022, imports (+6.1%) grew but exports (-3.5%) fell, shrinking the trade surplus from C 174 billion to C 158 billion.\" \" The United States and Switzerland were the EU\u2019s main trading partners for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023. \" \" Among the EU countries, Germany was the largest exporter of medicinal and pharmaceutical products to countries outside the EU, in 2023. \" This article is part of an online publication providing recent statistics on international trade in goods, covering information on the EU\u2019s main partners, main products traded, speci\ufb01c characteristics of trade as well as background information.\nStrong growth of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 Figure 1 shows that extra-EU exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products have decreased for the \ufb01rst time since 2008, dropping C 10 billion compared to 2022, while imports continued to increase. Even the \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008, which affected trade in many other products, did not cause a fall in exports or imports. With exports increasing more than imports, the trade surplus increased from C 18 billion in 2002 to a record high of C 174 billion in 2022 but fell to C 158 billion in 2023.\nFigure 1: EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Increasing share in total trade In 2023, the share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade was 7.8% with the share for imports (4.7%) much smaller than the share for exports (10.8%). Between 2002 and 2008 these shares remained fairly stable (Figure 2). In 2009, the share of imports increased by 1.3 percentage points (pp) and exports by 1.6 pp.\nThis was not caused by an increase in trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products but rather by the decline in total trade. Since 2009, the shares have been \ufb02uctuating but there is a clear overall growth.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 2 Figure 2: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade, 2002-2023 (% in total trade) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) United States and Switzerland remain the top EU partners The United States stands out as the EU\u2019s main trading partner for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 (Figure 3). Exports to the United States (33 %) were almost a third of all EU exports and were followed at some distance by Switzerland (15 %) and China (8 %). Imports to the EU were dominated even more by the United States (39 %) and Switzerland (32 %) followed by the United Kingdom (7 %). Since the United States and Switzerland are by far the two largest trade partners, the development of their trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products with the EU is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 3 Figure 3: Main EU partners for trade of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade with the United States and Switzerland between 2002 and 2023 Figure 4 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and the United States from 2002 to 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, imports from the United States increased by 19.3% while exports decreased by 1.5%. This caused the trade balance to fall from C 54 billion in 2022 to C 45 billion in 2023.\nMeasured as average annual growth between 2002 and 2023, exports increased by 8.8 % per year and imports increased by 7.2 % per year. During the whole period the EU has had a trade surplus with the United States, peaking at C 54 billion in 2022.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 4 Figure 4: EU trade with the United States in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Figure 5 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and Switzerland from 2002 to 2023. In 2023, for the \ufb01rst time in the period under investigation, exports (C 43 billion) were larger than imports (C 38 billion), causing the trade de\ufb01cit of C 1 billion in 2022 to turn into a surplus of C 4 billion in 2023. Over the whole period between 2002 and 2023, measured as average annual growth, exports increased by 10.0 % per year, while imports increased by 7.3 % per year.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 5 Figure 5: EU trade with Switzerland in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products by EU Member State The share of intra EU imports in total (intra + extra) imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 6). For Luxembourg, Lithua-nia and Estonia it was above 93 %, while for Slovenia and Malta it was below 40 %. The average for the EU was 68 %.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 6 Figure 6: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in intra and extra EU imports, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) The share of intra EU exports in total (intra + extra) exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products also varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 7). For Luxembourg, Slovakia, Czechia and Estonia it was above 80 %, while for Portugal, Finland, Denmark and Slovenia it was below 40 %. The average for the EU was 48 %.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 7 Figure 7: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in intra and extra EU exports, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Table 1 shows that in 2023, amongst the EU countries, Germany had the highest extra-EU exports (C 62 billion) followed by Belgium (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 37 billion). Four countries had shares higher than 20 % for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU exports. These were Slovenia (59 %), Ireland (33 %), Denmark (27 %) and Belgium (25 %).\nBelgium (C 26 billion), Germany (C 20 billion) and the Netherlands (C 16 billion) were the largest importers of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from countries outside the EU, in 20231. In 2023, Slovenia (18 %), Belgium (14 %) and Austria (13 %) had the highest shares for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU imports.\nGermany (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 31 billion) had the largest extra-EU trade surpluses for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023. Only Romania, Slovakia, Malta, Estonia and Czechia had trade de\ufb01cits.\n1Dutch and Belgian imports can be overestimated due to the so-called \"Rotterdam effect\" (See sectionData sources for more details) International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 8 Table 1: Extra EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (C million and %) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Source data for tables and graphs \u2022 International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products: tables and \ufb01gures Data sources This article is based on data available in the Eurostat COMEXT database for EU EU countries and in the United Nations COMTRADE database for non-EU countries.\nA code (such as \u2019DS_018995\u2019) is inserted as part of the source.

It should also be noted that European statistics on international trade in goods are compiled according to the EU concepts and de\ufb01nitions and may, therefore, differ from national data published by EU countries.\nProduct classi\ufb01cation Division 54 \u2019Medicinal and pharmaceutical products\u2019 of the Standard international trade classi\ufb01cation revision 4 (SITC Rev. 4), is made up of the sub-groups: \u2022 5411 \u2019Provitamins and vitamins (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5413 \u2019Antibiotics (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5414 \u2019Vegetable alkaloids (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5415 \u2019Hormones, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes\u2019; \u2022 5416 \u2019Glycosides; glands or other organs; antisera, vaccines; International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 9 \u2022 5419 \u2019Pharmaceutical goods, other than medicaments\u2019; \u2022 5421 \u2019Medicaments containing antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5422 \u2019Medicaments containing hormones, etc., but not antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5423 \u2019Medicaments containing alkaloids, but not containing hormones etc. or antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5429 \u2019Medicaments not elsewhere speci\ufb01ed\u2019.\nUnit of measure Trade values are expressed in millions (106) or billions (109) of euros. They correspond to the statistical value, i.e.\nto the amount which would be invoiced in case of sale or purchase at the national border of the reporting country. It is called a FOB value (free on board) for exports and a CIF value (cost, insurance, freight) for imports.\nA bias in the geographical allocation of extra-EU \ufb02ows Extra-EU imports and exports are reported by the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged, usually the place where the goods cross the EU external frontier (here referred to as the exit/entry Member State). This is not necessarily the Member State of actual import or export. The geographical allocation of an extra-EU \ufb02ow is biased in the case where the entry/exit Member State is not the actual importing/exporting Member State. In such a case, the extra-EU trade will be allocated to the entry/exit Member State and the actual importing/exporting Member State will report only intra-EU \ufb02ows with the exit/entry Member State. This issue particularly impacts the extra-EU imports of EU countries having important ports for transshipment of goods like Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This is why it is known as the \u2019Rotterdam effect\u2019.\nThe United Kingdom is considered as an extra-EU partner country for the EU for the whole period covered by this article. However, the United Kingdom was still part of the internal market until the end of the transitory period (31 December 2020), meaning that data on trade with the United Kingdom are still based on statistical concepts applicable to trade between the EU countries. Consequently, while imports from any other extra-EU trade partner are grouped by country of origin, the United Kingdom data re\ufb02ect the country of consignment. In practice this means that the goods imported by the EU from the United Kingdom were physically transported from the United Kingdom but part of these goods could have been of other origin than the United Kingdom. For this reason, data on trade with the United Kingdom are not fully comparable with data on trade with other extra-EU trade partners.\nContext Pharmaceutical products are among the most important products within the chemicals sector (SITC section 5).\nToday, the pharmaceutical sector is extensively regulated at EU level in the dual interest of ensuring the highest possible level of public health and patient con\ufb01dence in safe, effective and high-quality medicinal products, while continuing to develop a single EU market for pharmaceuticals in order to strengthen the European pharmaceutical industry\u2019s competitiveness and research capability.\nThe most common trade impediments faced by pharmaceutical exporters are a range of burdensome and costly registration, licensing and certi\ufb01cation procedures. The EU aims to redress these through its bilateral trade agreements or by tackling individual barriers as part of its market access partnership.\nOther articles \u2022 International trade in goods - other articles International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 10 Dedicated section International trade in goods - dedicated section Database International trade in goods - database Data visualisations \u2022 International trade in goods - visualisations Methodology International trade in goods - methodology Legislation \u2022 International trade in goods - legislation External links \u2022 European Commission - DG Trade Notes International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 11",

Collectively, that leading cohort of international buyers paid for 43.9% of globally imported drugs and medicines during 2023. That percentage indicates a relatively concentrated market of buyers worldwide.From a continental perspective, European countries were responsible for over half (53.8%) of spending on drugs and medicines imported during 2023 with pharmaceutical purchases valued at $268 billion. In second place were North American importers at 20.7% while another 17.4% of imported pharmaceuticals was delivered to customers in Asia.Smaller percentages were delivered to Latin America (3.9%) excluding Mexico but including the Caribbean, Africa (2.7%), then Oceania (1.5%) led by Australia and New Zealand.The metrics below combine subtotals for two 4-digit Harmonized Tariff System code prefixes for drugs and medicine subcategories, specifically prefixes 3003 (consisting of 2 or more constituents mixed together) and 3004 (other).Drugs and Medicines: Top 15 Importer CountriesBelow are the 15 countries that imported the highest dollar value worth of drugs and medicines during 2023.United States: US$89.8 billion (18% of imported prescription drugs and medicines)Switzerland: $40.5 billion (8.1%)Germany: $32.5 billion (6.5%)Belgium: $31.3 billion (6.3%)mainland China: $24.5 billion (4.9%)Italy: $20.6 billion (4.1%)France: $18.4 billion (3.7%)United Kingdom: $16.8 billion (3.4%)Japan: $15.9 billion (3.2%)Netherlands: $15.8 billion (3.2%)Spain: $14.9 billion (3%)Canada: $11.5 billion (2.3%)Russia: $8.7 billion (1.7%)Slovenia: $7.5 billion (1.5%)Poland: $6.9 billion (1.4%)By value, the listed 15 countries purchased 71.4% of all prescription drugs and medicines imports in 2023.Among the above countries, the fastest-growing markets for prescription drugs and medicines since 2019 were: Slovenia (up 92.6%), Switzerland (up 90.4%), Netherlands (up 55.9%) and Spain (up 38.5%).Three major markets that posted declines in their imported prescription drugs and medicines purchases were: Russia (down -16.9% from 2022), United Kingdom (down -10.6%) and Japan (down -6.4%).Drugs and Medicines: All Importer Countries in 2023By value, the 100 key countries showcased in the following automated database bought 98.5% of imported pharmaceutical drugs and medicines purchased in 2023.RankImporterDrugs & Medicines%2019-231.United States$89,784,868,000+13.3%2.Switzerland$40,508,742,000+90.4%3.Germany$32,470,160,000+4.7%4.Belgium$31,341,161,000+33%5.mainland China$24,543,916,000+14.1%6.Italy$20,578,736,000+20.4%7.France$18,352,469,000+15.5%8.United Kingdom$16,789,558,000-10.6%9.Japan$15,874,455,000-6.4%10.Netherlands$15,846,137,000+55.9%11.Spain$14,915,496,000+38.5%12.Canada$11,528,660,000+35.5%13.Russia$8,677,211,000-16.9%14.Slovenia$7,547,471,000+92.6%15.Poland$6,943,402,000+33.5%16.Australia$6,060,842,000+13.3%17.Ireland$5,971,430,000+39.2%18.Czech Republic$5,412,484,000+26.1%19.South Korea$5,334,372,000+30.1%20.Brazil$5,073,335,000+31.7%21.Austria$4,648,764,000+22.6%22.Mexico$4,533,840,000+60.3%23.Romania$4,300,172,000+40.3%24.Taiwan$4,166,141,000+35%25.Denmark$3,872,409,000+17.6%26.Saudi Arabia$3,666,414,000-11.9%27.Sweden$3,346,424,000+17.1%28.Egypt$3,275,554,000+51.4%29.Hungary$3,074,217,000+6.7%30.Greece$2,987,559,000+35.3%31.Hong Kong$2,983,988,000+34.1%32.Portugal$2,755,852,000+20.3%33.United Arab Emirates$2,429,182,000-25.6%34.T\u00fcrkiye$2,344,378,000-13.2%35.Colombia$2,301,768,000+46.5%36.Panama$2,119,079,000+26%37.Thailand$2,088,829,000+20.6%38.Slovakia$2,068,323,000+29.7%39.Singapore$1,923,068,000+20%40.Israel$1,897,285,000+9.4%41.Finland$1,870,201,000+17.1%42.Vietnam$1,819,464,000-32.6%43.Bulgaria$1,763,585,000+37.7%44.Ukraine$1,733,174,000+1%45.South Africa$1,731,505,000-3%46.Norway$1,705,741,000+10.1%47.Philippines$1,705,359,000+23.8%48.Kazakhstan$1,447,313,000+63.6%49.Chile$1,444,123,000+33.2%50.Lithuania$1,375,341,000+32.5%51.India$1,360,321,000-0.6%52.Argentina$1,266,289,000+10.1%53.Serbia$1,258,935,000+56.6%54.Malaysia$1,236,736,000-10.2%55.Croatia$1,157,943,000+30.7%56.New Zealand$1,021,456,000+58.8%57.Ecuador$1,009,529,000+40.5%58.Dominican Republic$903,093,000+50.5%59.Algeria$890,666,000-26.8%60.Indonesia$824,449,000+32.5%61.Guatemala$823,646,000+50.9%62.Latvia$793,096,000+30%63.Iraq$781,840,000-22.3%64.Uzbekistan$725,626,000-12.1%65.Costa Rica$676,671,000+16%66.Peru$670,747,000+15.8%67.Estonia$653,465,000+34.8%68.Luxembourg$627,835,000+39.8%69.Nigeria$616,888,000-31%70.Morocco$590,242,000+28.4%71.Jordan$549,354,000+23.2%72.Kuwait$524,991,000-49.5%73.Honduras$524,968,000+20.4%74.Sri Lanka$518,445,000+32.9%75.El Salvador$503,492,000+28.6%76.Tunisia$480,237,000+9.7%77.Iran$472,615,000-46.3%78.Azerbaijan$461,973,000+76.6%79.Ethiopia$460,848,000-17.4%80.Kenya$452,729,000-4.2%81.Belarus$448,584,000-24.7%82.Cyprus$431,955,000+61%83.Georgia$427,490,000+32.2%84.Nicaragua$419,879,000+30%85.Ivory Coast$403,719,000+16.7%86.Macao$378,970,000+63.3%87.Malta$371,918,000+50.8%88.Pakistan$365,901,000-22.4%89.Bosnia/Herzegovina$363,769,000+26.8%90.Myanmar$353,747,000-21.1%91.Qatar$352,935,000-23.8%92.Tanzania$328,493,000+31.2%93.Cambodia$268,915,000+39.6%94.Democratic Rep.

Even the \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008, which affected trade in many other products, did not cause a fall in exports or imports. With exports increasing more than imports, the trade surplus increased from C 18 billion in 2002 to a record high of C 174 billion in 2022 but fell to C 158 billion in 2023.\nFigure 1: EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Increasing share in total trade In 2023, the share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade was 7.8% with the share for imports (4.7%) much smaller than the share for exports (10.8%). Between 2002 and 2008 these shares remained fairly stable (Figure 2). In 2009, the share of imports increased by 1.3 percentage points (pp) and exports by 1.6 pp.\nThis was not caused by an increase in trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products but rather by the decline in total trade. Since 2009, the shares have been \ufb02uctuating but there is a clear overall growth.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 2 Figure 2: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade, 2002-2023 (% in total trade) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) United States and Switzerland remain the top EU partners The United States stands out as the EU\u2019s main trading partner for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 (Figure 3). Exports to the United States (33 %) were almost a third of all EU exports and were followed at some distance by Switzerland (15 %) and China (8 %). Imports to the EU were dominated even more by the United States (39 %) and Switzerland (32 %) followed by the United Kingdom (7 %). Since the United States and Switzerland are by far the two largest trade partners, the development of their trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products with the EU is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 3 Figure 3: Main EU partners for trade of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade with the United States and Switzerland between 2002 and 2023 Figure 4 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and the United States from 2002 to 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, imports from the United States increased by 19.3% while exports decreased by 1.5%. This caused the trade balance to fall from C 54 billion in 2022 to C 45 billion in 2023.\nMeasured as average annual growth between 2002 and 2023, exports increased by 8.8 % per year and imports increased by 7.2 % per year. During the whole period the EU has had a trade surplus with the United States, peaking at C 54 billion in 2022.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 4 Figure 4: EU trade with the United States in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Figure 5 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and Switzerland from 2002 to 2023. In 2023, for the \ufb01rst time in the period under investigation, exports (C 43 billion) were larger than imports (C 38 billion), causing the trade de\ufb01cit of C 1 billion in 2022 to turn into a surplus of C 4 billion in 2023. Over the whole period between 2002 and 2023, measured as average annual growth, exports increased by 10.0 % per year, while imports increased by 7.3 % per year.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 5 Figure 5: EU trade with Switzerland in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products by EU Member State The share of intra EU imports in total (intra + extra) imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 6). For Luxembourg, Lithua-nia and Estonia it was above 93 %, while for Slovenia and Malta it was below 40 %. The average for the EU was 68 %.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 6 Figure 6: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in intra and extra EU imports, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) The share of intra EU exports in total (intra + extra) exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products also varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 7). For Luxembourg, Slovakia, Czechia and Estonia it was above 80 %, while for Portugal, Finland, Denmark and Slovenia it was below 40 %. The average for the EU was 48 %.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 7 Figure 7: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in intra and extra EU exports, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Table 1 shows that in 2023, amongst the EU countries, Germany had the highest extra-EU exports (C 62 billion) followed by Belgium (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 37 billion). Four countries had shares higher than 20 % for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU exports. These were Slovenia (59 %), Ireland (33 %), Denmark (27 %) and Belgium (25 %).\nBelgium (C 26 billion), Germany (C 20 billion) and the Netherlands (C 16 billion) were the largest importers of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from countries outside the EU, in 20231. In 2023, Slovenia (18 %), Belgium (14 %) and Austria (13 %) had the highest shares for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU imports.\nGermany (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 31 billion) had the largest extra-EU trade surpluses for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023. Only Romania, Slovakia, Malta, Estonia and Czechia had trade de\ufb01cits.\n1Dutch and Belgian imports can be overestimated due to the so-called \"Rotterdam effect\" (See sectionData sources for more details) International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 8 Table 1: Extra EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (C million and %) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Source data for tables and graphs \u2022 International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products: tables and \ufb01gures Data sources This article is based on data available in the Eurostat COMEXT database for EU EU countries and in the United Nations COMTRADE database for non-EU countries.\nA code (such as \u2019DS_018995\u2019) is inserted as part of the source. This code allows the reader to easily access the most recent EU data on the Eurostat website. Note that data on the website is frequently updated and may also be more detailed or have a different measurement unit. It should also be noted that European statistics on international trade in goods are compiled according to the EU concepts and de\ufb01nitions and may, therefore, differ from national data published by EU countries.\nProduct classi\ufb01cation Division 54 \u2019Medicinal and pharmaceutical products\u2019 of the Standard international trade classi\ufb01cation revision 4 (SITC Rev. 4), is made up of the sub-groups: \u2022 5411 \u2019Provitamins and vitamins (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5413 \u2019Antibiotics (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5414 \u2019Vegetable alkaloids (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5415 \u2019Hormones, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes\u2019; \u2022 5416 \u2019Glycosides; glands or other organs; antisera, vaccines; International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 9 \u2022 5419 \u2019Pharmaceutical goods, other than medicaments\u2019; \u2022 5421 \u2019Medicaments containing antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5422 \u2019Medicaments containing hormones, etc., but not antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5423 \u2019Medicaments containing alkaloids, but not containing hormones etc. or antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5429 \u2019Medicaments not elsewhere speci\ufb01ed\u2019.\nUnit of measure Trade values are expressed in millions (106) or billions (109) of euros. They correspond to the statistical value, i.e.\nto the amount which would be invoiced in case of sale or purchase at the national border of the reporting country. It is called a FOB value (free on board) for exports and a CIF value (cost, insurance, freight) for imports.\nA bias in the geographical allocation of extra-EU \ufb02ows Extra-EU imports and exports are reported by the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged, usually the place where the goods cross the EU external frontier (here referred to as the exit/entry Member State). This is not necessarily the Member State of actual import or export. The geographical allocation of an extra-EU \ufb02ow is biased in the case where the entry/exit Member State is not the actual importing/exporting Member State. In such a case, the extra-EU trade will be allocated to the entry/exit Member State and the actual importing/exporting Member State will report only intra-EU \ufb02ows with the exit/entry Member State. This issue particularly impacts the extra-EU imports of EU countries having important ports for transshipment of goods like Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This is why it is known as the \u2019Rotterdam effect\u2019.\nThe United Kingdom is considered as an extra-EU partner country for the EU for the whole period covered by this article. However, the United Kingdom was still part of the internal market until the end of the transitory period (31 December 2020), meaning that data on trade with the United Kingdom are still based on statistical concepts applicable to trade between the EU countries. Consequently, while imports from any other extra-EU trade partner are grouped by country of origin, the United Kingdom data re\ufb02ect the country of consignment. In practice this means that the goods imported by the EU from the United Kingdom were physically transported from the United Kingdom but part of these goods could have been of other origin than the United Kingdom. For this reason, data on trade with the United Kingdom are not fully comparable with data on trade with other extra-EU trade partners.\nContext Pharmaceutical products are among the most important products within the chemicals sector (SITC section 5).\nToday, the pharmaceutical sector is extensively regulated at EU level in the dual interest of ensuring the highest possible level of public health and patient con\ufb01dence in safe, effective and high-quality medicinal products, while continuing to develop a single EU market for pharmaceuticals in order to strengthen the European pharmaceutical industry\u2019s competitiveness and research capability.\nThe most common trade impediments faced by pharmaceutical exporters are a range of burdensome and costly registration, licensing and certi\ufb01cation procedures. The EU aims to redress these through its bilateral trade agreements or by tackling individual barriers as part of its market access partnership.\nOther articles \u2022 International trade in goods - other articles International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 10 Dedicated section International trade in goods - dedicated section Database International trade in goods - database Data visualisations \u2022 International trade in goods - visualisations Methodology International trade in goods - methodology Legislation \u2022 International trade in goods - legislation External links \u2022 European Commission - DG Trade Notes International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 11",

      "Medicare Drug Prices Are Changing: What to Know\nMedicare released its new drug prices for 2026, and many of the costliest prescriptions are set to be lowered for Americans who rely on the government health insurance.\nPresident Joe Biden has approved deals with drug companies to lower the costs of 10 of Medicare's most common and expensive drugs.\nThe Biden administration said that the new prices would save taxpayers about $6 billion, while the seniors on Medicare could save $1.5 billion on their prescriptions.\n\"For years, millions of Americans were forced to choose between paying for medications or putting food on the table, while Big Pharma blocked Medicare from being able to negotiate prices on behalf of seniors and people with disabilities. But we fought back\u2014and won,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\"Today, for the first time in history, my Administration is announcing that Medicare has reached agreements on new, lower prices with the manufacturers of all 10 drugs selected for the first round of drug price negotiation.\"\nThe affected medications include those Americans use to manage diabetes, cancer and heart disease, which affect millions each year.\nFor the 10 medications, Medicare recipients will save between 38 and 79 percent starting in 2026. The drugs include Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp.\nBlood clot medications Eliquis and Xarelto went down to $231 and $197, while diabetes medications got major savings too.\nJardiance, Januvia, Farxiga and Fiasp shaved hundreds off their list prices for 2026, now costing between $100 and $200 compared to previous costs above $500 for a 30-day supply.\nThe full list of price changes was announced on the White House website.\nAltogether, more than 67 million Americans rely on Medicare for their health coverage, but high drug prices and premiums have made health care unaffordable for many.\n\"It's a relief for the millions of seniors that take these drugs to treat everything from heart failure, blood clots, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn's disease, and more\u2014and it's a relief for American taxpayers,\" Biden said.\nMedicare previously said blood thinners Xarelto and Eliquis would see lower prices because of the new deals, alongside diabetes medications Jardiance and Januvia.\nPreviously, the U.S. government was not permitted to negotiate with Big Pharma over drug prices, though private insurers always had this ability.\n\"This meant that drug companies could basically charge whatever they want for lifesaving treatments people rely on, and all Americans paid the price,\" White House adviser Neera Tanden said in a media call on Wednesday evening.\nPharmaceutical companies have not been pleased with Biden's price negotiations and pushed against the Inflation Reduction Act, which made the negotiations law.\nWhile the first 10 selected drug prices aren't set to change until 2026, the U.S. government can pick another 15 medications to negotiate on next year.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the negotiations would save the government $25 billion in the next seven years.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also instituted a cap on out-of-pocket drug costs, which is set to start in 2025. Next year, seniors can expect to pay a maximum of $2,000 for their prescriptions.\n\"As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare Part D has become a stronger safety net for Medicare beneficiaries who need expensive medications,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for medicareresources.org, told Newsweek. \"This will provide significant financial relief to enrollees who used to spend far more than that for their medications.\"\nWith the lower costs on prescriptions, there is some concern that those costs could be passed on to Medicare premium prices. Likely in an effort to mitigate some of those issues, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is paying an extra $15 per member per month to insurers.\n\"Some Republican lawmakers are challenging the premium stabilization program, alleging that it should have required congressional approval,\" Norris said. \"But the implementation of this program should ensure that people with Medicare Part D continue to have multiple affordable options for 2025.\"\nOpen enrollment for Medicare begins October 15 and runs to December 7, with all plan selections taking effect in January.\n\"It's a big win for Medicare recipients. One of the concerns going into these negotiations was that a deal wouldn't be reached, and a few of these drugs wouldn't have the same amount of coverage many need,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\n\"Even if you don't use one of the drugs covered, it's an encouraging sign,\" he added. \"With an increasing older population in America, more taxpayers are going to join Medicare in the coming years. The government taking a more proactive approach to negotiations to cover drug prices is one current and future recipients will be thankful for.\"\nUpdate 8/15/24, 10:18 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nTop stories\n\nTrump Is Picking the 'Avenger Squad' for Cabinet, Charlie Kirk Says\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nTrump Allies React to Biden Allowing Ukraine to Hit Russia With US ATACMS\n\nTrump Picks FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr To Lead the Agency\nAbout the writer\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Compared with areas with low telehealth use, high telehealth use was associated with more ambulatory care\u2013sensitive (ACS) hospitalizations (1.63 additional hospitalizations per 1000 beneficiaries per semester), no additional emergency department visits, more clinician encounters (0.30 additional clinician encounters per beneficiary per semester), and higher total cost of care ($164.99 higher cost per beneficiary per semester).\nMeaning\u00a0\r\n    Data from the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that higher levels of telehealth use may be associated with increased access to care and potentially lower quality of care (evidenced by increases in ACS hospitalizations); replication of this analysis with post\u2013COVID-19 data is needed to fully understand the impacts of the telehealth expansion.\nImportance\u00a0\r\n    Understanding the association of telehealth use with health care outcomes is fundamental to determining whether telehealth waivers implemented during the COVID-19 public health emergency should be made permanent. The current literature has yielded inconclusive findings owing to its focus on select states, practices, or health care systems.\nObjective\u00a0\r\n    To estimate the association of telehealth use with outcomes for all Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries by comparing hospital service areas (HSAs) with different levels of telehealth use.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\u00a0\r\n    This US population-based, retrospective cohort study was conducted from July 2022 to April 2023. Participants included Medicare claims of beneficiaries attributed to HSAs with FFS enrollment in Parts A and B.\nExposures\u00a0\r\n    Low, medium, or high tercile of telehealth use created by ranking HSAs according to the number of telehealth visits per 1000 beneficiaries.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\u00a0\r\n    The primary outcomes were quality (ambulatory care\u2013sensitive [ACS] hospitalizations and emergency department [ED] visits per 1000 FFS beneficiaries), access to care (clinician encounters per FFS beneficiary), and cost (total cost of care for Part A and/or B services per FFS Medicare beneficiary) determined with a difference-in-difference analysis.\nResults\u00a0\r\n    In this cohort study of claims from approximately 30 million Medicare beneficiaries (mean [SD] age in 2019, 71.04 [1.67] years; mean [SD] percentage female in 2019, 53.83% [2.14%]) within 3436 HSAs, between the second half of 2019 and the second half of 2021, mean ACS hospitalizations and ED visits declined sharply, mean clinician encounters per beneficiary declined slightly, and mean total cost of care per beneficiary per semester increased slightly. Compared with the low group, the high group had more ACS hospitalizations (1.63 additional hospitalizations per 1000 beneficiaries; 95% CI, 1.03-2.22 hospitalizations), more clinician encounters (0.30 additional encounters per beneficiary per semester; 95% CI, 0.23-0.38 encounters), and higher total cost of care ($164.99 higher cost per beneficiary per semester; 95% CI, $101.03-$228.96). There was no statistically significant difference in ACS ED visits between the low and high groups.\nConclusions and Relevance\u00a0\r\n    In this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries across all 3436 HSAs, high levels of telehealth use were associated with more clinician encounters, more ACS hospitalizations, and higher total health care costs. COVID-19 cases were still high during the period of study, which suggests that these findings partially reflect a higher capacity for providing health services in HSAs with higher telehealth intensity than other HSAs.\nMedicare\u2019s expansion of coverage for telehealth during the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE)1 led to sharply increased use of these services.2,3 Telehealth visits for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries increased 63-fold in 2020, from approximately 840\u202f000 visits in 2019 to nearly 52.7 million visits in 2020.4 Telehealth use peaked in the second quarter of 2020 (47% of Medicare users with a telehealth service) and leveled off by the end of 2022 (15%).5 Nevertheless, compared with prepandemic levels, telehealth use remains remarkably high. Even though the PHE ended in May 2023, Congress extended many Medicare telehealth expansions through December 2024 to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on health care outcomes more thoroughly and to inform potential permanent changes to telehealth coverage policy.6\nThe current literature on the association of telehealth use with outcomes such as health care utilization and quality is small and has yielded mixed results. Depending on which health care system was analyzed, telehealth has been found to be associated with both no increase in utilization (with telehealth substituting for in-person visits)7 and increased primary care utilization.8 Similarly, some studies have found telehealth use to be associated with lower health care quality, whereas others have found the opposite. A study9 using data from 1 urban integrated academic health system in California found that telehealth encounters were associated with higher repeat hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits than in-person encounters, and another study10 using data from a single commercial payer found that telehealth visits require more follow-up for acute conditions than in-person encounters. However, a recent study11 of Medicare patients aged 65 years or older from an accountable care organization in the Midwest found no significant difference between telehealth and in-person encounters in terms of the number of days until the next visit or the probabilities of 3-day and 7-day follow-up visits. Another study12 documented a largely favorable association between telehealth exposure and the quality of primary care using electronic medical record data of commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid beneficiaries from more than 200 outpatient care sites in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Differences in telehealth protocols across health care systems may have contributed to the inconclusive findings.13 In addition, most published studies compare telehealth users with nonusers, attempting to control for confounders but acknowledging the inherent bias. As an exception, Li et al14 categorized practice-level telehealth into terciles using Michigan commercial payer data; they found that patients from practices with higher telehealth use had a higher rate of ambulatory care\u2013sensitive (ACS) hospitalizations and ED visits.\nThe objective of our study is to assess the association of telehealth expansion with health care outcomes among all Medicare FFS beneficiaries. This is an important contribution to the literature given the various methodological limitations of previous studies, which were generally small; focused on select states, practices, or health systems; and compared telehealth users with nonusers. We use a population-based difference-in-differences (DID) method to test whether the telehealth expansion is associated with improved quality and access to care, as well as lower health care costs. Some of the results of this analysis were included in the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) June 2023 Report to Congress.6\nIn this cohort study, we used a DID design to estimate the association of telehealth use with quality of care, access to care, and cost of care for FFS Medicare beneficiaries. The baseline period is the second semester of 2019 (before the PHE and the expansion of telehealth), and the treatment period is the second semester of 2021 (after COVID-19 vaccines were widely available and the expansion of telehealth). The study population includes all Medicare FFS beneficiaries who had Part A and B enrollment during the entire semester and were alive as of the first day of that semester. Data are aggregated at the hospital service area (HSA) level, which is the unit of analysis. HSAs are local health care markets that satisfy most of the residents\u2019 health care needs, including hospitalizations, and the outcomes we analyze are intended to assess quality and access provided by local health care systems.15 Aggregating to the HSA level also lessens concerns about selection bias from comparing telehealth users and nonusers. Beneficiaries are attributed to an HSA using the first zip code for that year and semester. Informed consent was not sought because the data used in this study do not involve human research participants, as defined in 45 CFR \u00a746.102(e). Because the study did not use identifiable private data, nor was there any intervention or interaction with participants, the study was determined to be exempt from institutional review board oversight by the American Institute for Research\u2019s institutional review board. This study conforms to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.16\nWe created 3 levels of intensity for the usage of telehealth services, our exposure variable, by ranking HSAs according to the number of telehealth visits per 1000 beneficiaries in the second half of 2021 (telehealth was restricted before the PHE). The outcomes are quality of care, including ACS hospitalizations and ED visits per 1000 FFS Medicare beneficiaries; access to care, including clinician encounters per FFS Medicare beneficiary, with a breakdown by clinician type; and total cost of care for Part A and Part B services per FFS Medicare beneficiary with a breakdown of cost by service type. Clinician encounters are office visits identified using the Carrier claim file (excluding ambulatory surgery center services). Each encounter is a unique combination of beneficiary identification, claim identification, and National Provider Identifier.\nWe controlled for the following HSA Medicare population characteristics: share of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in FFS Medicare; share of Medicare FFS beneficiaries by age, sex, race, and Medicaid eligibility; mean hierarchical condition category risk score (and its square); share of FFS beneficiaries attributed to alternative payment models; and mean Area Deprivation Index (ADI) for FFS Medicare beneficiaries. We also controlled for HSA market characteristics: population size and new (in a given semester) and cumulative (from the start of the PHE) COVID-19 cases per 10\u202f000 people.\nWe identified telehealth visits using the Carrier physician and outpatient claims Standard Analytic Files. Outcome variables were calculated using FFS Medicare claims and the Common Medicare Environment custom enrollment file. Beneficiary covariates were calculated using the Common Medicare Environment custom enrollment file, Risk Adjustment System data, and Master Data Management beneficiary extract. We obtained the ADI from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health,17 population data from the US Census Bureau,18-20 and the number of COVID-19 cases from the New York Times database.21 For population size and COVID-19 cases, which are at the county level, we created a crosswalk between counties and HSAs. Data on race and ethnicity (Asian, Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White, unknown race, and any other race not otherwise specified) were obtained from Medicare enrollment files and are included in this study along with other demographic characteristics to control for changes over time within geographic areas that could confound the findings.\nThe analyses were conducted from July 2022 to April 2023 using StataMP version 16.1 (StataCorp). The Figure illustrates whether trends were parallel across groups by visually comparing outcome pretrends for the 3 treatment groups for 2018 and 2019. We analyzed descriptive statistics of demographic characteristics, comparing the second semester of 2019 and 2021, as well as across the 3 groups in the second semester of 2019. We conducted a linear regression with fixed-effects DID analysis that identifies the association of telehealth intensity by comparing the mean change in an outcome between 2019 and 2021 for HSAs with medium or high telehealth intensity with the mean change in that outcome for HSAs with low telehealth intensity during the same period. We adjusted for time-varying confounders using the covariates described earlier for 2019 and 2021. We estimated heteroskedastic robust SEs and clustered them at the HSA level. Statistical significance was defined as a 2-sided P\u2009<\u2009.05.\nWe conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we controlled for geographic adjustment factors using the hospital wage index from the Inpatient Prospective Payment System and measures of geographic practice cost indexes, because Medicare payments change from year to year as a result of changes in geographic adjustment factors. Second, we controlled for in-person utilization because the association of telehealth usage may be confounded with that of general health care utilization. Third, we excluded small HSAs (with <500 beneficiaries) because ACS hospitalizations and ED visit rates calculated using a denominator with fewer than 500 beneficiaries have low reliability. Fourth, we used quartiles of telehealth usage to define treatment. Fifth, we ran separate estimates for rural and urban HSAs because the high telehealth intensity group has higher levels of urbanicity and because differences in outcomes could, thus, be due to differences in urbanicity levels rather than telehealth usage. In addition, we estimated a propensity score\u2013weighted DID, where weights were obtained using multinomial logistic regression that estimated the probability of an HSA having low, medium, or high telehealth intensity on the basis of its observed characteristics during the second semester of 2019. Propensity score weighting makes low, medium, and high groups more comparable on observed characteristics and, presumably, on unobserved confounders as well.\nIn the 3436 HSAs analyzed, the sample declined from 31\u202f625\u202f338 beneficiaries in 2019 to 29\u202f335\u202f407 beneficiaries in 2021, mostly owing to increasing Medicare Advantage enrollment (mean [SD] age in 2019, 71.04 [1.67] years; mean [SD] percentage female in 2019, 53.83% [2.14%]). Nonetheless, the characteristics of beneficiaries in the sample were largely unchanged (Table 1).\nThe mean telehealth visits per 1000 FFS Medicare beneficiaries were 174 visits in the low intensity group, 311 in the medium intensity group, and 679 in the high telehealth intensity groups. The terciles were similar in terms of age and gender, but urbanicity and the ADI differed across groups. The high group was also more ethnically diverse and included a higher number of low-income beneficiaries (Table 2).\nBetween the second semester of 2019 and the second semester of 2021, mean ACS hospitalizations (\u22128.14 ACS hospitalizations per 1000 beneficiaries, 32.05% of the baseline rate) and ED visits (\u221212.12 ACS ED visits per 1000 beneficiaries per semester, 26.22% of the baseline rate) declined sharply, whereas the mean total cost of care per beneficiary per semester increased slightly ($424.54; 6.92% of the baseline rate). Mean clinician encounters per beneficiary declined slightly (\u22120.23 clinician encounters per beneficiary per semester; 2.72% of the baseline rate). The trends by tercile are shown in the Figure.\nTable 3 presents the DID regression results adjusted for covariates. Without adjusting for covariates, the high group had 1.39 additional ACS hospitalizations per 1000 beneficiaries (95% CI, 0.84-1.94 hospitalizations) compared with the low group. This difference remained mostly unchanged (1.63 additional hospitalizations; 95% CI, 1.03-2.22 hospitalizations) when we controlled for covariates (Table 3). Given the decline in ACS hospitalizations (Figure), this implies that mean ACS hospitalizations decreased in the high group but at a slower rate than in the low group. There was no statistically significant difference in ACS ED visits between the low and high groups, or between the low and medium groups for ACS hospitalizations or ED visits (Table 3).\nThe unadjusted difference between the medium and low groups in mean total clinician encounters per beneficiary per semester was not statistically significantly different from 0 (0.00; 95% CI, \u22120.04 to 0.04). After adjusting for covariates, there was still no statistically significant difference between the medium and low groups in total clinician encounters (Table 3). However, the medium group had a 0.04 increase in encounters (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.05 encounters) with advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) and physician assistants (PAs) compared with the low group. This was offset by a 0.03 decrease in encounters with specialists (95% CI, \u22120.07 to 0.00 encounters), which likely explains the absence of a statistically significant association for encounters with all types of clinicians.\nUnadjusted, the high group had an additional 0.10 mean total clinician encounters per beneficiary per semester (95% CI, 0.06-0.14 encounters) than the low group. After controlling for covariates, the high group had an increase of 0.30 clinician encounters per beneficiary per semester (95% CI, 0.23-0.38 encounters), which is 2.67% of the baseline rate. Although the analysis shows that the largest increases in the level of clinician encounters occurred among specialists, for whom encounters increased by 0.09 per beneficiary (95% CI, 0.05-0.13 encounters), this was the smallest change relative to the baseline rate (1.49%). The largest increases for the high telehealth intensity HSAs come from hospitalist encounters, which increased by 0.03 (95% CI, 0.02-0.04 encounters; 7.11% of the baseline rate). Similarly, encounters with APRNs and PAs, primary care physicians, and other practitioners (including psychologists and social workers) all increased: 6.60% for APRNs and PAs and 4.00% for other practitioners (Table 3).\nThere was no statistically significant difference in total cost of care per beneficiary per semester whether or not we adjusted for covariates (\u2212$5.79; 95% CI, \u2212$64.59 to $53.00), but there were 2 significant changes to specific categories of costs (adjusted for covariates) that approximately offset one another. Home health costs decreased compared with the low group by $7.44 (95% CI, \u2212$12.31 to \u2212$2.56), whereas durable medical equipment (DME) costs increased by $3.35 (95% CI, \u2212$0.02 to $6.73). Although these estimates do not exactly offset one another, the resulting difference is not statistically significantly different from 0. The analysis shows no statistically significant difference between the medium and low groups for the cost of inpatient care, outpatient care, skilled nursing facility (SNF) care, hospice care, or physician services (Table 3).\nWithout adjusting for covariates, the difference in total cost of care between the high and low group was not statistically significantly different from 0 ($30.16; 95% CI, \u2212$22.64 to $82.97). After adjustment, the high group showed a statistically significant increase ($164.99 overall; 95% CI, $101.03 to $228.96; 2.47% of baseline) in total cost of care per beneficiary per semester. There were statistically significant increases in SNF care, DME, physician services, and inpatient care, whereas costs decreased for home health and outpatient care (Table 3). The analysis showed no statistically significant association with hospice care.\nThe statistically significant results were robust to all sensitivity analyses described in the Methods section, with only marginal differences (see eAppendixes 1 and 2 in Supplement 1 and eTables 1-12 in Supplement 2). The parallel trends assumption is satisfied for most, but not all, outcomes and/or preperiods. Full details are shown in eAppendix 3 in Supplement 1 and eTable 13 in Supplement 2. Means by HSA over time can be found in eTable 14 in Supplement 2.\nThis cohort study compared quality, access, and costs between the second half of 2019 and second half of 2021 for HSAs with different levels of telehealth intensity using Medicare administrative data for all FFS beneficiaries. We found mixed results.\nDuring the study period, there were large decreases in ACS hospitalizations overall, but less so in areas with high telehealth intensity compared with the low telehealth intensity areas. We found no association with ED visits. The finding for ACS hospitalizations necessitates a nuanced interpretation. In general, reduced ACS hospitalizations are considered evidence of improved quality; however, during the PHE, less reduction may have been a marker of hospital capacity. Our measures of ACS hospitalizations and ED visits may have been directly affected by the PHE. One study22 found that respiratory-related ACS hospitalizations declined substantially starting early in the pandemic (around March 2020) and continuing until the end of that study (March 2021), potentially confounding our results.\nWe found that HSAs with high telehealth intensity had increases in clinician encounters for all clinician types compared with the low telehealth intensity areas. Telehealth may have increased accessibility by enabling visits even if patients were unable or unwilling to go in person. The clinicians with the largest relative increases in the number of encounters were hospitalists (7.11%), APRNs and PAs (6.60%), and other practitioners (4.00%). HSAs with medium telehealth intensity saw no significant change in clinician encounters, except for increasing visits with APRNs and PAs. These findings suggest that telehealth maintained or increased access to care, but differentially by specialty. The relative increase in hospitalist visit rates in high telehealth areas may reflect the growth of this specialty.23 The other practitioners category includes clinicians such as psychologists, social workers, physical therapists, and podiatrists. Increased encounters with clinicians in this category in high telehealth areas likely relates to telehealth-associated mental health care access, especially in urban areas.24\nConsistent with increased clinician encounters, the high telehealth HSAs saw statistically significant increases in physician services cost. These HSAs also had statistically significant increases in SNF, DME, and inpatient care cost and statistically significant decreases in home health and outpatient care cost. Although increasing costs in more intensive inpatient care during the height of the pandemic makes sense, in medium HSAs, only DME costs increased significantly. The observed increase in inpatient care cost in high HSAs is consistent with the relative increase in ACS hospitalizations in those areas and may be another sign of higher capacity in these areas.\nThis study has limitations that should be mentioned. The use of data from the second half of 2021 prevents the measurement of postpandemic outcomes. This period overlapped with the surge in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant, which peaked in September 2021, and the beginning of the surge due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, we cannot determine the associations of telehealth with quality, access, and cost independently of the PHE. In particular, the finding that telehealth intensity was associated with more hospitalizations but not ED visits is likely affected by the PHE. For example, if a patient delayed care because of concerns about COVID-19 but then had a telehealth encounter because of an acute concern, they may have then sought and been admitted for inpatient care rather than further delaying care, adding to the ACS hospitalizations for the high telehealth intensity HSAs. The overall pattern during a period when there were fewer concerns and capacity limits to in-person care could look very different.\nIn this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries within 3436 HSAs near the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency in the US, HSAs with the most telehealth usage improved access to care (as measured by clinician encounters at the HSA level) and attenuated the decline in ACS hospitalizations compared with other areas. Additional analysis using data from after the PHE and with alternative outcome measures could help produce estimates that, being subject to fewer confounding factors, better capture the potential beneficial effects of telehealth on the quality of care.\nAccepted for Publication: March 10, 2024.\nPublished: May 13, 2024. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.11006\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2024 Saharkhiz M et al.

      "Telemedicine Statistics \u2013 The Latest Telehealth Statistics in 2024\nIn this guide, we cover the main regional telemedicine markets, the most important telehealth use cases, and the key current and future trends in the field.\nTelemedicine statistics give us information about providing support and healthcare through electronic communication channels, like telephones and the internet. It\u2019s part of the digital transformation of healthcare and has been on the rise for the last few decades.\nIt was COVID-19, however, that really pushed telemedicine and remote clinical services into the spotlight. Around the world, medical professionals and patients relied on telehealth and virtual care to mitigate the risks of infection and optimize the resources of healthcare systems.\nAfter the pandemic, many facilities continued to offer remote healthcare services, and the market has been growing ever since.\nGiven these advancements and the considerable potential impact of telemedicine on healthcare, it\u2019s important to pay attention to telemedicine statistics and trends. Let\u2019s dive in.\nKey Telemedicine Statistics\nTelemedicine Market Size & Forecast\nAccording to Grand View Research, the telemedicine market was valued at almost $115 billion in 2023. The report forecasts it to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.96% between 2023 and 2030. Fortune Business Insights concurs with that assessment, predicting that the telemedicine market will reach $286.22 billion by 2030.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to the growth of the telemedicine market and the popularity of digital health solutions. Social distancing measures and the overwhelming impact on medical personnel meant that many routine appointments were canceled. Here\u2019s a quick overview of COVID-19\u2019s impact on telemedicine.\nTelemedicine and Covid-19\nA 2022 study by Kaiser Permanente tells us that before the start of the pandemic, telemedicine integration in the US was rudimentary, although 76% of American hospital systems did have some form of telehealth. However, in the first three months of the pandemic, telehealth insurance claims grew by 766%, and over 20% of all US medical appointments in 2020 were remote.\nMoreover, before COVID-19, 65% of American medical professionals had never used telemedicine, and 23% used it rarely.\nDuring the pandemic\u2019s peak, more than 97% of healthcare experts were using telemedicine. For 43%, half of their appointments were telehealth appointments. In terms of outlook, 44% of US doctors predict that between 10% and 49% of their future appointments will be through telehealth.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Region\nAs with most emerging technologies, regions use and develop telemedicine at different rates. In this section, we look at key telemedicine statistics in different parts of the world, including popularity and uptake, number of users, and consumer attitudes.\nNorth America\nNorth America is the largest telemedicine market in the world, with a share of 33.5%. That\u2019s hardly surprising since many telehealth companies have a presence in the region. Moreover, as of 2022, 22% of global telemedicine companies were looking to expand to Canada and 17% to the US.\nIn 2023, Canada\u2019s telehealth market revenue (including digital treatment and digital wellbeing) reached $2.42 billion,\u00a0roughly ~$100 million more than the year before. That revenue is forecast to hit $3.58 billion by 2028, as the significant growth is largely due to Canada\u2019s high telehealth literacy.\nAs of 2021, over 80% of physicians in the country had the expertise to provide virtual care, and 78% were satisfied by the level of patient support they could provide through this channel.\nIn the US, the telemedicine market was valued at $38.04 billion in 2022\u00a0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.1% until 2030. In 2023, 44% of physicians used it at least weekly\u00a0and 40% daily. For 65% of American physicians, 25% of all their appointments in 2022 were telehealth appointments.\nEurope\nThe European telemedicine market is almost on par with North America in terms of development and growth. As of 2022, 77% of European countries frequently used telemedicine, with COVID-19 contributing to its use. As our infographic shows, the Spanish telemedicine market had a significant boost during COVID-19.\nSpain is the largest telemedicine market in the EU. Almost 72% of Spanish residents had a telemedicine appointment during the pandemic. The market revenue was $270.2 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $351.5 million by 2027.\nGiven that the number of telemedicine users in the country increased from 1.18 million in 2020 to 1.32 million in 2021 and is forecast to reach 1.41 million in 2027, such exponential growth isn\u2019t surprising. The average revenue per user (ARPU) in telemedicine is also forecast to grow from $209.5 in 2022 to $250 by 2027.\nThe UK isn\u2019t far behind. For instance, over 80% of patients in the UK\u00a0 had a telephone (22%) or a video consultation (59%) with their doctor during COVID-19. And in 2022, 28% of physicians saw at least 75% of their patients via telemedicine. In comparison, this was 2% in Germany and Sweden, and 1% in France.\nIn 2022, the British telehealth market was valued at $1.58 billion and is forecast to reach $16.2 billion by 2030. The main reasons are the ongoing healthcare crisis in the UK and the government\u2019s digitization efforts.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America (LATAM), Brazil has the largest telehealth market, which is not surprising, considering it\u2019s one of the most populated countries in the world. In 2020, there were around 2.46 million users of online medical consultations.\nThe number grew to 3.49 million in 2023 and is forecast to reach 4.25 million by 2028. The ARPU has been growing steadily since 2021 and is predicted to reach $292.81 in 2028.\nOther LATAM countries have somewhat smaller telemedicine markets. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the region\u2019s 2023 telemedicine market revenue and its forecast growth.\nAsia-Pacific\nThe Asia-Pacific (APAC) telemedicine market is experiencing significant growth. Before the pandemic, the region\u2019s telemedicine adoption rate was low: 5% in Australia, 29% in India, and non-existent in Malaysia. However, in 2024, the adoption rate is predicted to grow exponentially: 70% in Malaysia, 76% in China, and 56% in Australia.\nAPAC\u2019s telemedicine market size was approximately $16.8 billion in 2020, and it\u2019s forecast to more than double by 2025 ($37.1 billion). Japan is expected to see some of the largest growth, from $5.1 billion in 2023 to $7.1 billion in 2028.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Audience\nNow, let\u2019s look at two user groups in these global telemedicine markets: the patients and the medical professionals.\nWho Uses Telemedicine?\nAccording to 2021 research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, 37% of adults used telemedicine, with slightly more females using it (42%) than males (31.7%). Regarding age, patients aged 65 and over used telemedicine the most (43.3%) and\u00a0Gen Z (18\u201325-year-olds) the least (29.4%) in 2021 .\nAn ASPE (a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services) study conducted a year later\u00a0shed more light on telemedicine users in 2022. It shows that 22.5% of adults and 18.1% of children in the US used telemedicine that year.\nLike the CDC study, the ASPE report found that Gen Z use telemedicine the least (17.6%)\u00a0and baby boomers (those aged 65+) the most (24.6%). In terms of income split, the highest percentage of telemedicine users in 2022 had an annual income of less than $25,000 (26.4%).\nBut what about other countries?\nIn Spain\u00a0more women used telemedicine (63.2%) than men (47.4%) in 2022, like the US. Again, similar to the US, Gen Z had the lowest rate of telemedicine use (49.1%). However, it was the millennials (aged 26\u201340) who used telemedicine most frequently (58%). For\u00a0baby boomers, the rate was 54.1%.\nAttitudes Towards Telemedicine\nAs with all innovations, people have varying opinions about telemedicine. In this section, we look at the statistics related to the opinions and attitudes of medical professionals and patients towards telemedicine.\nAs the above graph shows,\u00a0Australia had the highest percentage of physicians worldwide who were satisfied with telehealth in 2022. The potential for time saved using telemedicine was also highest in Australia in 2023 \u2013 up to six hours each year.\nIn fact, many physicians worldwide consider telemedicine a convenient solution. Almost 70% of American healthcare professionals perceived telemedicine as \u2018convenient\u2019 in 2021, and 35% as \u2018efficient.\u2019 Moreover, the lion\u2019s share of these physicians believe that ease of use is the key to ensuring patients\u2019 access to telemedicine.\nConvenience is also the prevalent factor among physicians in other countries. For instance, in Canada, 70% of healthcare professionals found providing video appointments very convenient, and 77% had the same opinion about telephone appointments. And 84% of physicians confirmed that telehealth made it easier for patients to access their care.\nPatients\u2019 attitudes towards telemedicine is moving in a positive direction. Before COVID-19, 66% of adults in the US had concerns about the quality of telemedicine. However, this changed after the pandemic, and as of 2021, 88% preferred to use telemedicine.\nMoreover, studies tell us that during COVID-19, patients\u2019 experiences with telehealth appointments were just as positive as or more positive than face-to-face healthcare appointments in the US.\nOf these appointments, patients tended to prefer video calls to telephone appointments. One study found that women preferred telehealth appointments for certain reproductive health issues.\nPatients in Mexico seem to concur. According to statistics from 2021, almost 80% of telemedicine users said telehealth appointments were just as good as in-person appointments. About one-third of people (27%) in Great Britain were skeptical of telemedicine before trying it.\nTop Telemedicine Use Case Statistics\nNow, let\u2019s take a closer look at why people use telemedicine. In this section, we\u2019ll delve into the most common use cases for telehealth appointments.\nDiagnostics & Follow-up Appointments\nThe most common reason people in the US used telemedicine in 2023 was follow-up appointments, which made up around 47% of all US telehealth appointments. It seems to be the convenience that people find attractive.\nIndeed, in a paper published in The American Journal of Managed Care, researchers stipulate that 52.5% of follow-up patients found telemedicine appointments more efficient.\nMental Health Support\nAnother common purpose of telehealth appointments is mental health support, used by over one-third of American telemedicine users between 2021 and 2023. These telemental health services improve access to mental healthcare for certain groups of people, but it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all solution, as it requires some technological literacy.\nChronic Conditions Support\nTelemedicine has been a game-changer for patients with chronic conditions. During COVID-19, telehealth was used by almost 50% of Europeans living with such conditions. In the US, physicians reported that 72% of their telehealth appointments were related to chronic care in 2021.\nIn addition to improving patients\u2019 quality of life, telemedicine is a significant time-saver for people with chronic illnesses. For instance, Italians with chronic pain could save up to 9.5 hours per year with telemedicine, more than in any other country. Germans and Australians with chronic conditions could save up to 7.4 hours.\nFuture Telemedicine Trends\nWhat is the future of telemedicine? Given that it\u2019s already making a huge difference to millions of people\u2019s lives, it\u2019s no surprise that the only way for telehealth is up.\nBut what are the trends shaping its development?\nIntegration With AI\nThe applications of AI in healthcare are boundless, and telemedicine is no exception. AI-powered apps can analyze huge amounts of patient data to help identify patterns and offer invaluable insights.\nChatbots and virtual assistants can enhance patient engagement by providing real-time responses to queries, helping schedule appointments, and setting reminders to take medication. Also, the diagnostics applications of AI can help save time and optimize physicians\u2019 workload.\nAugmented Reality & Virtual Reality\nTelemedicine doesn\u2019t just support patients, it can transform the day-to-day work of medical professionals. AR and VR can help professionals, especially those being trained, to engage in realistic medical simulations, such as surgeries and procedures.\nThese simulations can provide a valuable learning experience, boosting physicians\u2019 competence.\nRemote Patient Monitoring\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) is a big deal in telemedicine, especially for patients with chronic illnesses. For example, integrating RPM with wearable technologies allows healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely and access up-to-date data, enabling them to provide the best patient care. It also allows real-time responses to help prevent complications.\nClosing Thoughts\nLike any other medtech innovation, telehealth\u2019s primary goal is to help people. During COVID-19, we were shown how well telemedicine can work on an unprecedented scale, leading to accelerated digital transformation in medical technologies. As of 2023, that market was worth more than $100 billion, and it continues to grow.\nIn this guide, we reviewed the key telemedicine markets, how they are growing, how patients and medical professionals perceive telemedicine, and the most common use cases.\nWe feel optimistic about the future of telemedicine, telehealth, and other medtech advancements. However, we also know that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution, and we look forward to seeing how innovators will bridge the gap that restricts access to telemedicine and other healthcare to various population groups.\nSources\nQuestion & Answers (0)\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

      "Telemedicine Statistics \u2013 The Latest Telehealth Statistics in 2024\nIn this guide, we cover the main regional telemedicine markets, the most important telehealth use cases, and the key current and future trends in the field.\nTelemedicine statistics give us information about providing support and healthcare through electronic communication channels, like telephones and the internet. It\u2019s part of the digital transformation of healthcare and has been on the rise for the last few decades.\nIt was COVID-19, however, that really pushed telemedicine and remote clinical services into the spotlight. Around the world, medical professionals and patients relied on telehealth and virtual care to mitigate the risks of infection and optimize the resources of healthcare systems.\nAfter the pandemic, many facilities continued to offer remote healthcare services, and the market has been growing ever since.\nGiven these advancements and the considerable potential impact of telemedicine on healthcare, it\u2019s important to pay attention to telemedicine statistics and trends. Let\u2019s dive in.\nKey Telemedicine Statistics\nTelemedicine Market Size & Forecast\nAccording to Grand View Research, the telemedicine market was valued at almost $115 billion in 2023. The report forecasts it to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.96% between 2023 and 2030. Fortune Business Insights concurs with that assessment, predicting that the telemedicine market will reach $286.22 billion by 2030.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to the growth of the telemedicine market and the popularity of digital health solutions. Social distancing measures and the overwhelming impact on medical personnel meant that many routine appointments were canceled. Here\u2019s a quick overview of COVID-19\u2019s impact on telemedicine.\nTelemedicine and Covid-19\nA 2022 study by Kaiser Permanente tells us that before the start of the pandemic, telemedicine integration in the US was rudimentary, although 76% of American hospital systems did have some form of telehealth. However, in the first three months of the pandemic, telehealth insurance claims grew by 766%, and over 20% of all US medical appointments in 2020 were remote.\nMoreover, before COVID-19, 65% of American medical professionals had never used telemedicine, and 23% used it rarely.\nDuring the pandemic\u2019s peak, more than 97% of healthcare experts were using telemedicine. For 43%, half of their appointments were telehealth appointments. In terms of outlook, 44% of US doctors predict that between 10% and 49% of their future appointments will be through telehealth.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Region\nAs with most emerging technologies, regions use and develop telemedicine at different rates. In this section, we look at key telemedicine statistics in different parts of the world, including popularity and uptake, number of users, and consumer attitudes.\nNorth America\nNorth America is the largest telemedicine market in the world, with a share of 33.5%. That\u2019s hardly surprising since many telehealth companies have a presence in the region. Moreover, as of 2022, 22% of global telemedicine companies were looking to expand to Canada and 17% to the US.\nIn 2023, Canada\u2019s telehealth market revenue (including digital treatment and digital wellbeing) reached $2.42 billion,\u00a0roughly ~$100 million more than the year before. That revenue is forecast to hit $3.58 billion by 2028, as the significant growth is largely due to Canada\u2019s high telehealth literacy.\nAs of 2021, over 80% of physicians in the country had the expertise to provide virtual care, and 78% were satisfied by the level of patient support they could provide through this channel.\nIn the US, the telemedicine market was valued at $38.04 billion in 2022\u00a0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.1% until 2030. In 2023, 44% of physicians used it at least weekly\u00a0and 40% daily. For 65% of American physicians, 25% of all their appointments in 2022 were telehealth appointments.\nEurope\nThe European telemedicine market is almost on par with North America in terms of development and growth. As of 2022, 77% of European countries frequently used telemedicine, with COVID-19 contributing to its use. As our infographic shows, the Spanish telemedicine market had a significant boost during COVID-19.\nSpain is the largest telemedicine market in the EU. Almost 72% of Spanish residents had a telemedicine appointment during the pandemic. The market revenue was $270.2 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $351.5 million by 2027.\nGiven that the number of telemedicine users in the country increased from 1.18 million in 2020 to 1.32 million in 2021 and is forecast to reach 1.41 million in 2027, such exponential growth isn\u2019t surprising. The average revenue per user (ARPU) in telemedicine is also forecast to grow from $209.5 in 2022 to $250 by 2027.\nThe UK isn\u2019t far behind. For instance, over 80% of patients in the UK\u00a0 had a telephone (22%) or a video consultation (59%) with their doctor during COVID-19. And in 2022, 28% of physicians saw at least 75% of their patients via telemedicine. In comparison, this was 2% in Germany and Sweden, and 1% in France.\nIn 2022, the British telehealth market was valued at $1.58 billion and is forecast to reach $16.2 billion by 2030. The main reasons are the ongoing healthcare crisis in the UK and the government\u2019s digitization efforts.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America (LATAM), Brazil has the largest telehealth market, which is not surprising, considering it\u2019s one of the most populated countries in the world. In 2020, there were around 2.46 million users of online medical consultations.\nThe number grew to 3.49 million in 2023 and is forecast to reach 4.25 million by 2028. The ARPU has been growing steadily since 2021 and is predicted to reach $292.81 in 2028.\nOther LATAM countries have somewhat smaller telemedicine markets. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the region\u2019s 2023 telemedicine market revenue and its forecast growth.\nAsia-Pacific\nThe Asia-Pacific (APAC) telemedicine market is experiencing significant growth. Before the pandemic, the region\u2019s telemedicine adoption rate was low: 5% in Australia, 29% in India, and non-existent in Malaysia. However, in 2024, the adoption rate is predicted to grow exponentially: 70% in Malaysia, 76% in China, and 56% in Australia.\nAPAC\u2019s telemedicine market size was approximately $16.8 billion in 2020, and it\u2019s forecast to more than double by 2025 ($37.1 billion). Japan is expected to see some of the largest growth, from $5.1 billion in 2023 to $7.1 billion in 2028.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Audience\nNow, let\u2019s look at two user groups in these global telemedicine markets: the patients and the medical professionals.\nWho Uses Telemedicine?\nAccording to 2021 research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, 37% of adults used telemedicine, with slightly more females using it (42%) than males (31.7%). Regarding age, patients aged 65 and over used telemedicine the most (43.3%) and\u00a0Gen Z (18\u201325-year-olds) the least (29.4%) in 2021 .\nAn ASPE (a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services) study conducted a year later\u00a0shed more light on telemedicine users in 2022. It shows that 22.5% of adults and 18.1% of children in the US used telemedicine that year.\nLike the CDC study, the ASPE report found that Gen Z use telemedicine the least (17.6%)\u00a0and baby boomers (those aged 65+) the most (24.6%). In terms of income split, the highest percentage of telemedicine users in 2022 had an annual income of less than $25,000 (26.4%).\nBut what about other countries?\nIn Spain\u00a0more women used telemedicine (63.2%) than men (47.4%) in 2022, like the US. Again, similar to the US, Gen Z had the lowest rate of telemedicine use (49.1%). However, it was the millennials (aged 26\u201340) who used telemedicine most frequently (58%). For\u00a0baby boomers, the rate was 54.1%.\nAttitudes Towards Telemedicine\nAs with all innovations, people have varying opinions about telemedicine. In this section, we look at the statistics related to the opinions and attitudes of medical professionals and patients towards telemedicine.\nAs the above graph shows,\u00a0Australia had the highest percentage of physicians worldwide who were satisfied with telehealth in 2022. The potential for time saved using telemedicine was also highest in Australia in 2023 \u2013 up to six hours each year.\nIn fact, many physicians worldwide consider telemedicine a convenient solution. Almost 70% of American healthcare professionals perceived telemedicine as \u2018convenient\u2019 in 2021, and 35% as \u2018efficient.\u2019 Moreover, the lion\u2019s share of these physicians believe that ease of use is the key to ensuring patients\u2019 access to telemedicine.\nConvenience is also the prevalent factor among physicians in other countries. For instance, in Canada, 70% of healthcare professionals found providing video appointments very convenient, and 77% had the same opinion about telephone appointments. And 84% of physicians confirmed that telehealth made it easier for patients to access their care.\nPatients\u2019 attitudes towards telemedicine is moving in a positive direction. Before COVID-19, 66% of adults in the US had concerns about the quality of telemedicine. However, this changed after the pandemic, and as of 2021, 88% preferred to use telemedicine.\nMoreover, studies tell us that during COVID-19, patients\u2019 experiences with telehealth appointments were just as positive as or more positive than face-to-face healthcare appointments in the US.\nOf these appointments, patients tended to prefer video calls to telephone appointments. One study found that women preferred telehealth appointments for certain reproductive health issues.\nPatients in Mexico seem to concur. According to statistics from 2021, almost 80% of telemedicine users said telehealth appointments were just as good as in-person appointments. About one-third of people (27%) in Great Britain were skeptical of telemedicine before trying it.\nTop Telemedicine Use Case Statistics\nNow, let\u2019s take a closer look at why people use telemedicine. In this section, we\u2019ll delve into the most common use cases for telehealth appointments.\nDiagnostics & Follow-up Appointments\nThe most common reason people in the US used telemedicine in 2023 was follow-up appointments, which made up around 47% of all US telehealth appointments. It seems to be the convenience that people find attractive.\nIndeed, in a paper published in The American Journal of Managed Care, researchers stipulate that 52.5% of follow-up patients found telemedicine appointments more efficient.\nMental Health Support\nAnother common purpose of telehealth appointments is mental health support, used by over one-third of American telemedicine users between 2021 and 2023. These telemental health services improve access to mental healthcare for certain groups of people, but it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all solution, as it requires some technological literacy.\nChronic Conditions Support\nTelemedicine has been a game-changer for patients with chronic conditions. During COVID-19, telehealth was used by almost 50% of Europeans living with such conditions. In the US, physicians reported that 72% of their telehealth appointments were related to chronic care in 2021.\nIn addition to improving patients\u2019 quality of life, telemedicine is a significant time-saver for people with chronic illnesses. For instance, Italians with chronic pain could save up to 9.5 hours per year with telemedicine, more than in any other country. Germans and Australians with chronic conditions could save up to 7.4 hours.\nFuture Telemedicine Trends\nWhat is the future of telemedicine? Given that it\u2019s already making a huge difference to millions of people\u2019s lives, it\u2019s no surprise that the only way for telehealth is up.\nBut what are the trends shaping its development?\nIntegration With AI\nThe applications of AI in healthcare are boundless, and telemedicine is no exception. AI-powered apps can analyze huge amounts of patient data to help identify patterns and offer invaluable insights.\nChatbots and virtual assistants can enhance patient engagement by providing real-time responses to queries, helping schedule appointments, and setting reminders to take medication. Also, the diagnostics applications of AI can help save time and optimize physicians\u2019 workload.\nAugmented Reality & Virtual Reality\nTelemedicine doesn\u2019t just support patients, it can transform the day-to-day work of medical professionals. AR and VR can help professionals, especially those being trained, to engage in realistic medical simulations, such as surgeries and procedures.\nThese simulations can provide a valuable learning experience, boosting physicians\u2019 competence.\nRemote Patient Monitoring\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) is a big deal in telemedicine, especially for patients with chronic illnesses. For example, integrating RPM with wearable technologies allows healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely and access up-to-date data, enabling them to provide the best patient care. It also allows real-time responses to help prevent complications.\nClosing Thoughts\nLike any other medtech innovation, telehealth\u2019s primary goal is to help people. During COVID-19, we were shown how well telemedicine can work on an unprecedented scale, leading to accelerated digital transformation in medical technologies. As of 2023, that market was worth more than $100 billion, and it continues to grow.\nIn this guide, we reviewed the key telemedicine markets, how they are growing, how patients and medical professionals perceive telemedicine, and the most common use cases.\nWe feel optimistic about the future of telemedicine, telehealth, and other medtech advancements. However, we also know that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution, and we look forward to seeing how innovators will bridge the gap that restricts access to telemedicine and other healthcare to various population groups.\nSources\nQuestion & Answers (0)\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

      "\n    California Health Care Foundation\n  \n\n    Utility menu\n  \nThe Prognosis for Telehealth\nThe future of primary care could be a hybrid model of in-person and telehealth care, including both phone and video visits\nOne of the biggest shifts in health care that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t about vaccines or masks or monoclonal antibodies. In fact, it wasn\u2019t really about the SARS-CoV-2 virus at all. It was the dramatic growth of telehealth.\nBetween February and April 2020, telehealth visits for primary care, conducted either by phone or video, increased from zero to 148 visits per 1,000 patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in California, according to new research from the Santa Monica\u2013based RAND Corporation. In contrast, in-person care dropped from about 230 to 65 visits per 1,000 patients during that time, RAND found.\nBy the summer of 2021, the number of in-person visits at California FQHCs had rebounded to 66% of primary care appointments, but telehealth still composed about one-third of visits. Telehealth is even more prevalent in the behavioral health care realm, with 72% of appointments conducted either by phone or video as of August 2021.\n\u201cWe joke that a decade of telemedicine implementation happened in a week or two,\u201d said Lori Uscher-Pines, a RAND senior policy researcher. \u201cIt was amazing how quickly health systems and individual providers were able to start offering telehealth visits.\u201d\nThis rapid shift to telehealth is unsurprising, given the urgency of keeping patients and staff members safe during the pandemic. What remains to be seen is whether, once the dust settles and COVID-19 is deemed less of a threat, telehealth will be here to stay.\nThe findings of the RAND report suggest that while telehealth has a valuable role in increasing access to care, it should not serve as a blanket replacement for in-person visits. There were concerns over the efficacy of audio-only appointments, the difficulties in implementing video visits, and whether patients might be at risk of receiving inadequate care because of these technological challenges. As a result, a hybrid model, including in-person, video, and occasionally audio visits that caters to patients\u2019 individual needs, would likely be the best approach, the researchers said.\nOvercoming Barriers to Care\nA strong argument in favor of telehealth is that virtual visits, both audio and video, enhance equity by increasing accessibility and flexibility for patients. \u201cWe look at the many barriers that patients face in getting care \u2014 geography, transportation, childcare, getting time off work, language,\u201d said Chris Perrone, director of CHCF\u2019s Improving Access team, which funded RAND\u2019s research. \u201cTelehealth makes it easier to see or talk with a physician without having to find childcare, take a day off work, or travel long distances.\u201d\nThat expands access to care, Perrone said.\nHowever, there are questions about whether the level of care offered in telehealth visits is as effective and as high quality as in-person visits. Also, some visits must be conducted in person because of the need for a physical examination or the collection of lab samples and biometric information.\nBefore the pandemic, one of the biggest concerns about telehealth services was the rising costs of that approach to providing care. \u201cTelemedicine use was very restricted prior to the pandemic, both at the federal level and at the state level across the US,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cA big concern was that offering telehealth would increase costs without necessarily improving population health. That\u2019s because telehealth is so easy to access and it\u2019s so convenient that it would lead to extra utilization that was not necessary.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, Medicare and state Medicaid programs did not pay for telehealth visits except in specified situations. In March 2020, that policy quickly changed out of necessity. In March of this year, federal reimbursements for telehealth services were extended until at least the end of 2022 \u2014 and possibly longer \u2014 with the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In California, the Department of Health Care Services is committed to continue paying FQHCs for video and audio telehealth visits after the pandemic \u2014 covering all Medi-Cal covered benefits and services.\nPerceptions of Telehealth\nFacing this inflection point, CHCF commissioned several reports to assess the state of telehealth during the pandemic at California FQHCs, which serve people with low incomes and are primarily funded through reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.\nAn assessment (PDF)\u00a0of 23 FQHCs\u2019 implementation of telehealth during the height of COVID-19, found that 86% of providers were satisfied with the work they performed via telehealth and 84% would continue providing telehealth after the pandemic subsides.\nA second report from RAND surveyed staff and providers at 45 FQHCs, public hospitals, and community health centers across the state, which serve a combined 1.7 million patients. It found that, overall, \u201cPerceptions of whether telehealth provided an acceptable level of care were relatively positive, but perceptions of its sustainability \u2014 as well as perceptions of equity and quality of care \u2014 were nuanced.\u201d\nWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\n\u2014Lori Uscher-Pines, RAND Corporation\nTelehealth provided important access to care during the pandemic and helped patients overcome \u201cbarriers to in-person care, such as transportation,\u201d the report found. However, there were concerns about \u201cinequities in access, particularly for patients who were most affected by the digital divide.\u201d\nCHCF also funded other research that documents patient views on telehealth. A 2020 CHCF survey of people with low incomes found their telehealth visits compared favorably to in-person visits. Seventy-two percent of respondents who received care by phone were as satisfied or more satisfied. Of those who received care by video, 65% were as satisfied or more satisfied than with their last in-person visit.\nAudio-Only Versus Video Visits\nHealth care workers\u2019 biggest worry centered around phone versus video visits. Among the FQHCs that were part of RAND\u2019s recent analysis, less than 5% of telehealth visits were conducted via video, despite their advantages over audio-only visits in many cases. As a result, a major emphasis has been on how clinics can expand access to video visits for their patients.\n\u201cSurveys suggest that providers generally prefer video visits,\u201d said Uscher-Pines. \u201cThey get additional information \u2014 for example, just being able to see and visually examine the patient. Providers say they really like being able to see a patient\u2019s home environment and for the patient to open up their medicine cabinet and show what\u2019s in it.\u201d\nHowever, it\u2019s also true that many patients don\u2019t like video for this very reason \u2014 they don\u2019t want to let providers into their homes, particularly if they haven\u2019t developed a trusting relationship with the provider.\nNeighborhood Healthcare in San Diego County and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) were two FQHCs that invested in video telehealth early in the pandemic. They reported that there were considerable growing pains in getting both patients and physicians to use the technology.\nIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is.\n\u2014Amanda Churape, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital\n\u201cWhat comes with integrating a new workflow is a lot of hesitancy, so our numbers were pretty low in the beginning,\u201d said Amanda Churape, a specialty care program manager at ZSFG. \u201cA lot of our providers and staff had actually never used Zoom or had never really had experience doing video, so there was a lot of training that needed to be done.\u201d\nSignificant numbers of patients and providers did not have a Zoom-compatible device at all, she said.\n\u201cWe started pushing very early on to go to video, and that was a challenge simply because those platforms, at that time, were just poorly developed,\u201d said Jeffrey Glenn, chief operating officer at Neighborhood. \u201cOur visits are 15 minutes apiece, so the providers would tell us, \u2018I can\u2019t spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to connect the patient.\u2019 And so early on, they would give up quickly and they would say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to call you.\u2019\u201d\nRamping Up Capabilities\nTo assist with the transition to remote provider visits, CHCF \u2014 which had funded projects working to expand use of the model even before the pandemic \u2014 launched the $6 million Tipping Point for Telehealth Initiative to help FQHCs ramp up their digital capabilities. The initiative included a learning collaborative on how to provide telehealth most effectively, dubbed the Connected Care Accelerator, as well as grants to enable clinics to invest in training and equipment.\nClinics were given flexibility in how they used the money as long as they applied it to expanding their telehealth capacity. Some of the clinics used the money to hire a specialized coordinator, like Churape, who oversees a team of telehealth ambassadors who help set up patients for video visits. First, the ambassadors screen patients to see if they have a device with a camera and access to Wi-Fi or an unlimited data plan. Then the ambassadors teach the patient how to download the application, join the meeting, and troubleshoot audio and video issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is,\u201d Churape said. \u201cWhat took the most time is actually getting the patient onto the application, teaching them how to download the application, teaching them how to join a meeting.\u201d\nOther FQHCs, including Neighborhood, used the grant money to buy equipment like iPads and rolling workstations to provide virtual visits at their clinics. Medical assistants move the rolling video displays between exam rooms and queue up patient calls, allowing physicians to transition seamlessly back and forth between in-person and telehealth visits.\n\u201cA provider may be in Exam Room A seeing a patient in person, but then when they get done and walk into the next room, there may be a virtual patient sitting on the iPad,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIn the very beginning we felt like we need to have dedicated providers, like 100% telehealth or 100% in-person. Then we graduated to this hybrid model, which we are still employing today.\u201d\nLooking Ahead: A Hybrid Model of Care\nEven with all the work they\u2019ve put in, Neighborhood and ZSFG say most of their telehealth visits are still conducted via telephone. That may be because many of the populations the clinics serve face the greatest barriers to accessing care: the elderly, people experiencing homelessness, and people with limited English proficiency. Uscher-Pines worries that those patients, who are only able to obtain audio telehealth services, may be receiving lower quality care as a result.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a little bit concerning is that [these] patients are getting an untested service,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cIt may be that audio-only visits are appropriate for many different use cases, but the literature just isn\u2019t there yet to support when it\u2019s appropriate and when it\u2019s not.\u201d\nGiven the advantages and drawbacks of telehealth, audio, and video, many providers are now calling for a hybrid model of care, offering a mix of in-person and virtual appointments depending on the patient and purpose of the visit.\n\u201cTelehealth quality is really complicated. The question is not \u2018Does telehealth work?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Does telehealth work for this patient population with this condition served in this setting?\u2019\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s clear from the RAND report is that the flexibility of telehealth is valuable for many patients and providers, with one-third of visits conducted virtually over a year into the pandemic. Making sure that these appointments, whether they are conducted by phone or video, are accessible, and are of the highest quality, will be critical in ensuring equitable care for patients who face barriers to in-person visits, even after the COVID-19 public health emergency is over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDana G.

      "Telemedicine Statistics \u2013 The Latest Telehealth Statistics in 2024\nIn this guide, we cover the main regional telemedicine markets, the most important telehealth use cases, and the key current and future trends in the field.\nTelemedicine statistics give us information about providing support and healthcare through electronic communication channels, like telephones and the internet. It\u2019s part of the digital transformation of healthcare and has been on the rise for the last few decades.\nIt was COVID-19, however, that really pushed telemedicine and remote clinical services into the spotlight. Around the world, medical professionals and patients relied on telehealth and virtual care to mitigate the risks of infection and optimize the resources of healthcare systems.\nAfter the pandemic, many facilities continued to offer remote healthcare services, and the market has been growing ever since.\nGiven these advancements and the considerable potential impact of telemedicine on healthcare, it\u2019s important to pay attention to telemedicine statistics and trends. Let\u2019s dive in.\nKey Telemedicine Statistics\nTelemedicine Market Size & Forecast\nAccording to Grand View Research, the telemedicine market was valued at almost $115 billion in 2023. The report forecasts it to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.96% between 2023 and 2030. Fortune Business Insights concurs with that assessment, predicting that the telemedicine market will reach $286.22 billion by 2030.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to the growth of the telemedicine market and the popularity of digital health solutions. Social distancing measures and the overwhelming impact on medical personnel meant that many routine appointments were canceled. Here\u2019s a quick overview of COVID-19\u2019s impact on telemedicine.\nTelemedicine and Covid-19\nA 2022 study by Kaiser Permanente tells us that before the start of the pandemic, telemedicine integration in the US was rudimentary, although 76% of American hospital systems did have some form of telehealth. However, in the first three months of the pandemic, telehealth insurance claims grew by 766%, and over 20% of all US medical appointments in 2020 were remote.\nMoreover, before COVID-19, 65% of American medical professionals had never used telemedicine, and 23% used it rarely.\nDuring the pandemic\u2019s peak, more than 97% of healthcare experts were using telemedicine. For 43%, half of their appointments were telehealth appointments. In terms of outlook, 44% of US doctors predict that between 10% and 49% of their future appointments will be through telehealth.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Region\nAs with most emerging technologies, regions use and develop telemedicine at different rates. In this section, we look at key telemedicine statistics in different parts of the world, including popularity and uptake, number of users, and consumer attitudes.\nNorth America\nNorth America is the largest telemedicine market in the world, with a share of 33.5%. That\u2019s hardly surprising since many telehealth companies have a presence in the region. Moreover, as of 2022, 22% of global telemedicine companies were looking to expand to Canada and 17% to the US.\nIn 2023, Canada\u2019s telehealth market revenue (including digital treatment and digital wellbeing) reached $2.42 billion,\u00a0roughly ~$100 million more than the year before. That revenue is forecast to hit $3.58 billion by 2028, as the significant growth is largely due to Canada\u2019s high telehealth literacy.\nAs of 2021, over 80% of physicians in the country had the expertise to provide virtual care, and 78% were satisfied by the level of patient support they could provide through this channel.\nIn the US, the telemedicine market was valued at $38.04 billion in 2022\u00a0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.1% until 2030. In 2023, 44% of physicians used it at least weekly\u00a0and 40% daily. For 65% of American physicians, 25% of all their appointments in 2022 were telehealth appointments.\nEurope\nThe European telemedicine market is almost on par with North America in terms of development and growth. As of 2022, 77% of European countries frequently used telemedicine, with COVID-19 contributing to its use. As our infographic shows, the Spanish telemedicine market had a significant boost during COVID-19.\nSpain is the largest telemedicine market in the EU. Almost 72% of Spanish residents had a telemedicine appointment during the pandemic. The market revenue was $270.2 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $351.5 million by 2027.\nGiven that the number of telemedicine users in the country increased from 1.18 million in 2020 to 1.32 million in 2021 and is forecast to reach 1.41 million in 2027, such exponential growth isn\u2019t surprising. The average revenue per user (ARPU) in telemedicine is also forecast to grow from $209.5 in 2022 to $250 by 2027.\nThe UK isn\u2019t far behind. For instance, over 80% of patients in the UK\u00a0 had a telephone (22%) or a video consultation (59%) with their doctor during COVID-19. And in 2022, 28% of physicians saw at least 75% of their patients via telemedicine. In comparison, this was 2% in Germany and Sweden, and 1% in France.\nIn 2022, the British telehealth market was valued at $1.58 billion and is forecast to reach $16.2 billion by 2030. The main reasons are the ongoing healthcare crisis in the UK and the government\u2019s digitization efforts.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America (LATAM), Brazil has the largest telehealth market, which is not surprising, considering it\u2019s one of the most populated countries in the world. In 2020, there were around 2.46 million users of online medical consultations.\nThe number grew to 3.49 million in 2023 and is forecast to reach 4.25 million by 2028. The ARPU has been growing steadily since 2021 and is predicted to reach $292.81 in 2028.\nOther LATAM countries have somewhat smaller telemedicine markets. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the region\u2019s 2023 telemedicine market revenue and its forecast growth.\nAsia-Pacific\nThe Asia-Pacific (APAC) telemedicine market is experiencing significant growth. Before the pandemic, the region\u2019s telemedicine adoption rate was low: 5% in Australia, 29% in India, and non-existent in Malaysia. However, in 2024, the adoption rate is predicted to grow exponentially: 70% in Malaysia, 76% in China, and 56% in Australia.\nAPAC\u2019s telemedicine market size was approximately $16.8 billion in 2020, and it\u2019s forecast to more than double by 2025 ($37.1 billion). Japan is expected to see some of the largest growth, from $5.1 billion in 2023 to $7.1 billion in 2028.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Audience\nNow, let\u2019s look at two user groups in these global telemedicine markets: the patients and the medical professionals.\nWho Uses Telemedicine?\nAccording to 2021 research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, 37% of adults used telemedicine, with slightly more females using it (42%) than males (31.7%). Regarding age, patients aged 65 and over used telemedicine the most (43.3%) and\u00a0Gen Z (18\u201325-year-olds) the least (29.4%) in 2021 .\nAn ASPE (a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services) study conducted a year later\u00a0shed more light on telemedicine users in 2022. It shows that 22.5% of adults and 18.1% of children in the US used telemedicine that year.\nLike the CDC study, the ASPE report found that Gen Z use telemedicine the least (17.6%)\u00a0and baby boomers (those aged 65+) the most (24.6%). In terms of income split, the highest percentage of telemedicine users in 2022 had an annual income of less than $25,000 (26.4%).\nBut what about other countries?\nIn Spain\u00a0more women used telemedicine (63.2%) than men (47.4%) in 2022, like the US. Again, similar to the US, Gen Z had the lowest rate of telemedicine use (49.1%). However, it was the millennials (aged 26\u201340) who used telemedicine most frequently (58%). For\u00a0baby boomers, the rate was 54.1%.\nAttitudes Towards Telemedicine\nAs with all innovations, people have varying opinions about telemedicine. In this section, we look at the statistics related to the opinions and attitudes of medical professionals and patients towards telemedicine.\nAs the above graph shows,\u00a0Australia had the highest percentage of physicians worldwide who were satisfied with telehealth in 2022. The potential for time saved using telemedicine was also highest in Australia in 2023 \u2013 up to six hours each year.\nIn fact, many physicians worldwide consider telemedicine a convenient solution. Almost 70% of American healthcare professionals perceived telemedicine as \u2018convenient\u2019 in 2021, and 35% as \u2018efficient.\u2019 Moreover, the lion\u2019s share of these physicians believe that ease of use is the key to ensuring patients\u2019 access to telemedicine.\nConvenience is also the prevalent factor among physicians in other countries. For instance, in Canada, 70% of healthcare professionals found providing video appointments very convenient, and 77% had the same opinion about telephone appointments. And 84% of physicians confirmed that telehealth made it easier for patients to access their care.\nPatients\u2019 attitudes towards telemedicine is moving in a positive direction. Before COVID-19, 66% of adults in the US had concerns about the quality of telemedicine. However, this changed after the pandemic, and as of 2021, 88% preferred to use telemedicine.\nMoreover, studies tell us that during COVID-19, patients\u2019 experiences with telehealth appointments were just as positive as or more positive than face-to-face healthcare appointments in the US.\nOf these appointments, patients tended to prefer video calls to telephone appointments. One study found that women preferred telehealth appointments for certain reproductive health issues.\nPatients in Mexico seem to concur. According to statistics from 2021, almost 80% of telemedicine users said telehealth appointments were just as good as in-person appointments. About one-third of people (27%) in Great Britain were skeptical of telemedicine before trying it.\nTop Telemedicine Use Case Statistics\nNow, let\u2019s take a closer look at why people use telemedicine. In this section, we\u2019ll delve into the most common use cases for telehealth appointments.\nDiagnostics & Follow-up Appointments\nThe most common reason people in the US used telemedicine in 2023 was follow-up appointments, which made up around 47% of all US telehealth appointments. It seems to be the convenience that people find attractive.\nIndeed, in a paper published in The American Journal of Managed Care, researchers stipulate that 52.5% of follow-up patients found telemedicine appointments more efficient.\nMental Health Support\nAnother common purpose of telehealth appointments is mental health support, used by over one-third of American telemedicine users between 2021 and 2023. These telemental health services improve access to mental healthcare for certain groups of people, but it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all solution, as it requires some technological literacy.\nChronic Conditions Support\nTelemedicine has been a game-changer for patients with chronic conditions. During COVID-19, telehealth was used by almost 50% of Europeans living with such conditions. In the US, physicians reported that 72% of their telehealth appointments were related to chronic care in 2021.\nIn addition to improving patients\u2019 quality of life, telemedicine is a significant time-saver for people with chronic illnesses. For instance, Italians with chronic pain could save up to 9.5 hours per year with telemedicine, more than in any other country. Germans and Australians with chronic conditions could save up to 7.4 hours.\nFuture Telemedicine Trends\nWhat is the future of telemedicine? Given that it\u2019s already making a huge difference to millions of people\u2019s lives, it\u2019s no surprise that the only way for telehealth is up.\nBut what are the trends shaping its development?\nIntegration With AI\nThe applications of AI in healthcare are boundless, and telemedicine is no exception. AI-powered apps can analyze huge amounts of patient data to help identify patterns and offer invaluable insights.\nChatbots and virtual assistants can enhance patient engagement by providing real-time responses to queries, helping schedule appointments, and setting reminders to take medication. Also, the diagnostics applications of AI can help save time and optimize physicians\u2019 workload.\nAugmented Reality & Virtual Reality\nTelemedicine doesn\u2019t just support patients, it can transform the day-to-day work of medical professionals. AR and VR can help professionals, especially those being trained, to engage in realistic medical simulations, such as surgeries and procedures.\nThese simulations can provide a valuable learning experience, boosting physicians\u2019 competence.\nRemote Patient Monitoring\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) is a big deal in telemedicine, especially for patients with chronic illnesses. For example, integrating RPM with wearable technologies allows healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely and access up-to-date data, enabling them to provide the best patient care. It also allows real-time responses to help prevent complications.\nClosing Thoughts\nLike any other medtech innovation, telehealth\u2019s primary goal is to help people. During COVID-19, we were shown how well telemedicine can work on an unprecedented scale, leading to accelerated digital transformation in medical technologies. As of 2023, that market was worth more than $100 billion, and it continues to grow.\nIn this guide, we reviewed the key telemedicine markets, how they are growing, how patients and medical professionals perceive telemedicine, and the most common use cases.\nWe feel optimistic about the future of telemedicine, telehealth, and other medtech advancements. However, we also know that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution, and we look forward to seeing how innovators will bridge the gap that restricts access to telemedicine and other healthcare to various population groups.\nSources\nQuestion & Answers (0)\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

      "\n    California Health Care Foundation\n  \n\n    Utility menu\n  \nThe Prognosis for Telehealth\nThe future of primary care could be a hybrid model of in-person and telehealth care, including both phone and video visits\nOne of the biggest shifts in health care that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t about vaccines or masks or monoclonal antibodies. In fact, it wasn\u2019t really about the SARS-CoV-2 virus at all. It was the dramatic growth of telehealth.\nBetween February and April 2020, telehealth visits for primary care, conducted either by phone or video, increased from zero to 148 visits per 1,000 patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in California, according to new research from the Santa Monica\u2013based RAND Corporation. In contrast, in-person care dropped from about 230 to 65 visits per 1,000 patients during that time, RAND found.\nBy the summer of 2021, the number of in-person visits at California FQHCs had rebounded to 66% of primary care appointments, but telehealth still composed about one-third of visits. Telehealth is even more prevalent in the behavioral health care realm, with 72% of appointments conducted either by phone or video as of August 2021.\n\u201cWe joke that a decade of telemedicine implementation happened in a week or two,\u201d said Lori Uscher-Pines, a RAND senior policy researcher. \u201cIt was amazing how quickly health systems and individual providers were able to start offering telehealth visits.\u201d\nThis rapid shift to telehealth is unsurprising, given the urgency of keeping patients and staff members safe during the pandemic. What remains to be seen is whether, once the dust settles and COVID-19 is deemed less of a threat, telehealth will be here to stay.\nThe findings of the RAND report suggest that while telehealth has a valuable role in increasing access to care, it should not serve as a blanket replacement for in-person visits. There were concerns over the efficacy of audio-only appointments, the difficulties in implementing video visits, and whether patients might be at risk of receiving inadequate care because of these technological challenges. As a result, a hybrid model, including in-person, video, and occasionally audio visits that caters to patients\u2019 individual needs, would likely be the best approach, the researchers said.\nOvercoming Barriers to Care\nA strong argument in favor of telehealth is that virtual visits, both audio and video, enhance equity by increasing accessibility and flexibility for patients. \u201cWe look at the many barriers that patients face in getting care \u2014 geography, transportation, childcare, getting time off work, language,\u201d said Chris Perrone, director of CHCF\u2019s Improving Access team, which funded RAND\u2019s research. \u201cTelehealth makes it easier to see or talk with a physician without having to find childcare, take a day off work, or travel long distances.\u201d\nThat expands access to care, Perrone said.\nHowever, there are questions about whether the level of care offered in telehealth visits is as effective and as high quality as in-person visits. Also, some visits must be conducted in person because of the need for a physical examination or the collection of lab samples and biometric information.\nBefore the pandemic, one of the biggest concerns about telehealth services was the rising costs of that approach to providing care. \u201cTelemedicine use was very restricted prior to the pandemic, both at the federal level and at the state level across the US,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cA big concern was that offering telehealth would increase costs without necessarily improving population health. That\u2019s because telehealth is so easy to access and it\u2019s so convenient that it would lead to extra utilization that was not necessary.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, Medicare and state Medicaid programs did not pay for telehealth visits except in specified situations. In March 2020, that policy quickly changed out of necessity. In March of this year, federal reimbursements for telehealth services were extended until at least the end of 2022 \u2014 and possibly longer \u2014 with the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In California, the Department of Health Care Services is committed to continue paying FQHCs for video and audio telehealth visits after the pandemic \u2014 covering all Medi-Cal covered benefits and services.\nPerceptions of Telehealth\nFacing this inflection point, CHCF commissioned several reports to assess the state of telehealth during the pandemic at California FQHCs, which serve people with low incomes and are primarily funded through reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.\nAn assessment (PDF)\u00a0of 23 FQHCs\u2019 implementation of telehealth during the height of COVID-19, found that 86% of providers were satisfied with the work they performed via telehealth and 84% would continue providing telehealth after the pandemic subsides.\nA second report from RAND surveyed staff and providers at 45 FQHCs, public hospitals, and community health centers across the state, which serve a combined 1.7 million patients. It found that, overall, \u201cPerceptions of whether telehealth provided an acceptable level of care were relatively positive, but perceptions of its sustainability \u2014 as well as perceptions of equity and quality of care \u2014 were nuanced.\u201d\nWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\n\u2014Lori Uscher-Pines, RAND Corporation\nTelehealth provided important access to care during the pandemic and helped patients overcome \u201cbarriers to in-person care, such as transportation,\u201d the report found. However, there were concerns about \u201cinequities in access, particularly for patients who were most affected by the digital divide.\u201d\nCHCF also funded other research that documents patient views on telehealth. A 2020 CHCF survey of people with low incomes found their telehealth visits compared favorably to in-person visits. Seventy-two percent of respondents who received care by phone were as satisfied or more satisfied. Of those who received care by video, 65% were as satisfied or more satisfied than with their last in-person visit.\nAudio-Only Versus Video Visits\nHealth care workers\u2019 biggest worry centered around phone versus video visits. Among the FQHCs that were part of RAND\u2019s recent analysis, less than 5% of telehealth visits were conducted via video, despite their advantages over audio-only visits in many cases. As a result, a major emphasis has been on how clinics can expand access to video visits for their patients.\n\u201cSurveys suggest that providers generally prefer video visits,\u201d said Uscher-Pines. \u201cThey get additional information \u2014 for example, just being able to see and visually examine the patient. Providers say they really like being able to see a patient\u2019s home environment and for the patient to open up their medicine cabinet and show what\u2019s in it.\u201d\nHowever, it\u2019s also true that many patients don\u2019t like video for this very reason \u2014 they don\u2019t want to let providers into their homes, particularly if they haven\u2019t developed a trusting relationship with the provider.\nNeighborhood Healthcare in San Diego County and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) were two FQHCs that invested in video telehealth early in the pandemic. They reported that there were considerable growing pains in getting both patients and physicians to use the technology.\nIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is.\n\u2014Amanda Churape, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital\n\u201cWhat comes with integrating a new workflow is a lot of hesitancy, so our numbers were pretty low in the beginning,\u201d said Amanda Churape, a specialty care program manager at ZSFG. \u201cA lot of our providers and staff had actually never used Zoom or had never really had experience doing video, so there was a lot of training that needed to be done.\u201d\nSignificant numbers of patients and providers did not have a Zoom-compatible device at all, she said.\n\u201cWe started pushing very early on to go to video, and that was a challenge simply because those platforms, at that time, were just poorly developed,\u201d said Jeffrey Glenn, chief operating officer at Neighborhood. \u201cOur visits are 15 minutes apiece, so the providers would tell us, \u2018I can\u2019t spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to connect the patient.\u2019 And so early on, they would give up quickly and they would say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to call you.\u2019\u201d\nRamping Up Capabilities\nTo assist with the transition to remote provider visits, CHCF \u2014 which had funded projects working to expand use of the model even before the pandemic \u2014 launched the $6 million Tipping Point for Telehealth Initiative to help FQHCs ramp up their digital capabilities. The initiative included a learning collaborative on how to provide telehealth most effectively, dubbed the Connected Care Accelerator, as well as grants to enable clinics to invest in training and equipment.\nClinics were given flexibility in how they used the money as long as they applied it to expanding their telehealth capacity. Some of the clinics used the money to hire a specialized coordinator, like Churape, who oversees a team of telehealth ambassadors who help set up patients for video visits. First, the ambassadors screen patients to see if they have a device with a camera and access to Wi-Fi or an unlimited data plan. Then the ambassadors teach the patient how to download the application, join the meeting, and troubleshoot audio and video issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is,\u201d Churape said. \u201cWhat took the most time is actually getting the patient onto the application, teaching them how to download the application, teaching them how to join a meeting.\u201d\nOther FQHCs, including Neighborhood, used the grant money to buy equipment like iPads and rolling workstations to provide virtual visits at their clinics. Medical assistants move the rolling video displays between exam rooms and queue up patient calls, allowing physicians to transition seamlessly back and forth between in-person and telehealth visits.\n\u201cA provider may be in Exam Room A seeing a patient in person, but then when they get done and walk into the next room, there may be a virtual patient sitting on the iPad,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIn the very beginning we felt like we need to have dedicated providers, like 100% telehealth or 100% in-person. Then we graduated to this hybrid model, which we are still employing today.\u201d\nLooking Ahead: A Hybrid Model of Care\nEven with all the work they\u2019ve put in, Neighborhood and ZSFG say most of their telehealth visits are still conducted via telephone. That may be because many of the populations the clinics serve face the greatest barriers to accessing care: the elderly, people experiencing homelessness, and people with limited English proficiency. Uscher-Pines worries that those patients, who are only able to obtain audio telehealth services, may be receiving lower quality care as a result.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a little bit concerning is that [these] patients are getting an untested service,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cIt may be that audio-only visits are appropriate for many different use cases, but the literature just isn\u2019t there yet to support when it\u2019s appropriate and when it\u2019s not.\u201d\nGiven the advantages and drawbacks of telehealth, audio, and video, many providers are now calling for a hybrid model of care, offering a mix of in-person and virtual appointments depending on the patient and purpose of the visit.\n\u201cTelehealth quality is really complicated. The question is not \u2018Does telehealth work?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Does telehealth work for this patient population with this condition served in this setting?\u2019\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s clear from the RAND report is that the flexibility of telehealth is valuable for many patients and providers, with one-third of visits conducted virtually over a year into the pandemic. Making sure that these appointments, whether they are conducted by phone or video, are accessible, and are of the highest quality, will be critical in ensuring equitable care for patients who face barriers to in-person visits, even after the COVID-19 public health emergency is over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDana G.

      "\n    California Health Care Foundation\n  \n\n    Utility menu\n  \nThe Prognosis for Telehealth\nThe future of primary care could be a hybrid model of in-person and telehealth care, including both phone and video visits\nOne of the biggest shifts in health care that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t about vaccines or masks or monoclonal antibodies. In fact, it wasn\u2019t really about the SARS-CoV-2 virus at all. It was the dramatic growth of telehealth.\nBetween February and April 2020, telehealth visits for primary care, conducted either by phone or video, increased from zero to 148 visits per 1,000 patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in California, according to new research from the Santa Monica\u2013based RAND Corporation. In contrast, in-person care dropped from about 230 to 65 visits per 1,000 patients during that time, RAND found.\nBy the summer of 2021, the number of in-person visits at California FQHCs had rebounded to 66% of primary care appointments, but telehealth still composed about one-third of visits. Telehealth is even more prevalent in the behavioral health care realm, with 72% of appointments conducted either by phone or video as of August 2021.\n\u201cWe joke that a decade of telemedicine implementation happened in a week or two,\u201d said Lori Uscher-Pines, a RAND senior policy researcher. \u201cIt was amazing how quickly health systems and individual providers were able to start offering telehealth visits.\u201d\nThis rapid shift to telehealth is unsurprising, given the urgency of keeping patients and staff members safe during the pandemic. What remains to be seen is whether, once the dust settles and COVID-19 is deemed less of a threat, telehealth will be here to stay.\nThe findings of the RAND report suggest that while telehealth has a valuable role in increasing access to care, it should not serve as a blanket replacement for in-person visits. There were concerns over the efficacy of audio-only appointments, the difficulties in implementing video visits, and whether patients might be at risk of receiving inadequate care because of these technological challenges. As a result, a hybrid model, including in-person, video, and occasionally audio visits that caters to patients\u2019 individual needs, would likely be the best approach, the researchers said.\nOvercoming Barriers to Care\nA strong argument in favor of telehealth is that virtual visits, both audio and video, enhance equity by increasing accessibility and flexibility for patients. \u201cWe look at the many barriers that patients face in getting care \u2014 geography, transportation, childcare, getting time off work, language,\u201d said Chris Perrone, director of CHCF\u2019s Improving Access team, which funded RAND\u2019s research. \u201cTelehealth makes it easier to see or talk with a physician without having to find childcare, take a day off work, or travel long distances.\u201d\nThat expands access to care, Perrone said.\nHowever, there are questions about whether the level of care offered in telehealth visits is as effective and as high quality as in-person visits. Also, some visits must be conducted in person because of the need for a physical examination or the collection of lab samples and biometric information.\nBefore the pandemic, one of the biggest concerns about telehealth services was the rising costs of that approach to providing care. \u201cTelemedicine use was very restricted prior to the pandemic, both at the federal level and at the state level across the US,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cA big concern was that offering telehealth would increase costs without necessarily improving population health. That\u2019s because telehealth is so easy to access and it\u2019s so convenient that it would lead to extra utilization that was not necessary.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, Medicare and state Medicaid programs did not pay for telehealth visits except in specified situations. In March 2020, that policy quickly changed out of necessity. In March of this year, federal reimbursements for telehealth services were extended until at least the end of 2022 \u2014 and possibly longer \u2014 with the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In California, the Department of Health Care Services is committed to continue paying FQHCs for video and audio telehealth visits after the pandemic \u2014 covering all Medi-Cal covered benefits and services.\nPerceptions of Telehealth\nFacing this inflection point, CHCF commissioned several reports to assess the state of telehealth during the pandemic at California FQHCs, which serve people with low incomes and are primarily funded through reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.\nAn assessment (PDF)\u00a0of 23 FQHCs\u2019 implementation of telehealth during the height of COVID-19, found that 86% of providers were satisfied with the work they performed via telehealth and 84% would continue providing telehealth after the pandemic subsides.\nA second report from RAND surveyed staff and providers at 45 FQHCs, public hospitals, and community health centers across the state, which serve a combined 1.7 million patients. It found that, overall, \u201cPerceptions of whether telehealth provided an acceptable level of care were relatively positive, but perceptions of its sustainability \u2014 as well as perceptions of equity and quality of care \u2014 were nuanced.\u201d\nWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\n\u2014Lori Uscher-Pines, RAND Corporation\nTelehealth provided important access to care during the pandemic and helped patients overcome \u201cbarriers to in-person care, such as transportation,\u201d the report found. However, there were concerns about \u201cinequities in access, particularly for patients who were most affected by the digital divide.\u201d\nCHCF also funded other research that documents patient views on telehealth. A 2020 CHCF survey of people with low incomes found their telehealth visits compared favorably to in-person visits. Seventy-two percent of respondents who received care by phone were as satisfied or more satisfied. Of those who received care by video, 65% were as satisfied or more satisfied than with their last in-person visit.\nAudio-Only Versus Video Visits\nHealth care workers\u2019 biggest worry centered around phone versus video visits. Among the FQHCs that were part of RAND\u2019s recent analysis, less than 5% of telehealth visits were conducted via video, despite their advantages over audio-only visits in many cases. As a result, a major emphasis has been on how clinics can expand access to video visits for their patients.\n\u201cSurveys suggest that providers generally prefer video visits,\u201d said Uscher-Pines. \u201cThey get additional information \u2014 for example, just being able to see and visually examine the patient. Providers say they really like being able to see a patient\u2019s home environment and for the patient to open up their medicine cabinet and show what\u2019s in it.\u201d\nHowever, it\u2019s also true that many patients don\u2019t like video for this very reason \u2014 they don\u2019t want to let providers into their homes, particularly if they haven\u2019t developed a trusting relationship with the provider.\nNeighborhood Healthcare in San Diego County and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) were two FQHCs that invested in video telehealth early in the pandemic. They reported that there were considerable growing pains in getting both patients and physicians to use the technology.\nIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is.\n\u2014Amanda Churape, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital\n\u201cWhat comes with integrating a new workflow is a lot of hesitancy, so our numbers were pretty low in the beginning,\u201d said Amanda Churape, a specialty care program manager at ZSFG. \u201cA lot of our providers and staff had actually never used Zoom or had never really had experience doing video, so there was a lot of training that needed to be done.\u201d\nSignificant numbers of patients and providers did not have a Zoom-compatible device at all, she said.\n\u201cWe started pushing very early on to go to video, and that was a challenge simply because those platforms, at that time, were just poorly developed,\u201d said Jeffrey Glenn, chief operating officer at Neighborhood. \u201cOur visits are 15 minutes apiece, so the providers would tell us, \u2018I can\u2019t spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to connect the patient.\u2019 And so early on, they would give up quickly and they would say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to call you.\u2019\u201d\nRamping Up Capabilities\nTo assist with the transition to remote provider visits, CHCF \u2014 which had funded projects working to expand use of the model even before the pandemic \u2014 launched the $6 million Tipping Point for Telehealth Initiative to help FQHCs ramp up their digital capabilities. The initiative included a learning collaborative on how to provide telehealth most effectively, dubbed the Connected Care Accelerator, as well as grants to enable clinics to invest in training and equipment.\nClinics were given flexibility in how they used the money as long as they applied it to expanding their telehealth capacity. Some of the clinics used the money to hire a specialized coordinator, like Churape, who oversees a team of telehealth ambassadors who help set up patients for video visits. First, the ambassadors screen patients to see if they have a device with a camera and access to Wi-Fi or an unlimited data plan. Then the ambassadors teach the patient how to download the application, join the meeting, and troubleshoot audio and video issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is,\u201d Churape said. \u201cWhat took the most time is actually getting the patient onto the application, teaching them how to download the application, teaching them how to join a meeting.\u201d\nOther FQHCs, including Neighborhood, used the grant money to buy equipment like iPads and rolling workstations to provide virtual visits at their clinics. Medical assistants move the rolling video displays between exam rooms and queue up patient calls, allowing physicians to transition seamlessly back and forth between in-person and telehealth visits.\n\u201cA provider may be in Exam Room A seeing a patient in person, but then when they get done and walk into the next room, there may be a virtual patient sitting on the iPad,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIn the very beginning we felt like we need to have dedicated providers, like 100% telehealth or 100% in-person. Then we graduated to this hybrid model, which we are still employing today.\u201d\nLooking Ahead: A Hybrid Model of Care\nEven with all the work they\u2019ve put in, Neighborhood and ZSFG say most of their telehealth visits are still conducted via telephone. That may be because many of the populations the clinics serve face the greatest barriers to accessing care: the elderly, people experiencing homelessness, and people with limited English proficiency. Uscher-Pines worries that those patients, who are only able to obtain audio telehealth services, may be receiving lower quality care as a result.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a little bit concerning is that [these] patients are getting an untested service,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cIt may be that audio-only visits are appropriate for many different use cases, but the literature just isn\u2019t there yet to support when it\u2019s appropriate and when it\u2019s not.\u201d\nGiven the advantages and drawbacks of telehealth, audio, and video, many providers are now calling for a hybrid model of care, offering a mix of in-person and virtual appointments depending on the patient and purpose of the visit.\n\u201cTelehealth quality is really complicated. The question is not \u2018Does telehealth work?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Does telehealth work for this patient population with this condition served in this setting?\u2019\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s clear from the RAND report is that the flexibility of telehealth is valuable for many patients and providers, with one-third of visits conducted virtually over a year into the pandemic. Making sure that these appointments, whether they are conducted by phone or video, are accessible, and are of the highest quality, will be critical in ensuring equitable care for patients who face barriers to in-person visits, even after the COVID-19 public health emergency is over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDana G.

With telemedicine, patients can now receive medical advice, diagnosis, disease management and treatment from the comfort of their homes, increasing their access to care and eliminating physical barriers created by hospital capacity, distance or transportation.\nThis report examines the continued adoption of telemedicine, its applications across various specialties and health care services, and its effects on physician well-being, patient access, and continuity of care. Study findings show that 88% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, with many reporting reduced wait times, improved adherence to treatment plans, and decreased no-show rates. Additionally, a consider- able portion of physicians surveyed reported that telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules and positively impacted their feelings of autonomy and work-life balance. Beyond expanding access to health care, telemedicine may also be increasing patients\u2019 willingness to seek medical attention. The majority of all patients surveyed (70%) said they may be more likely to consult with a doctor if they can do so virtually, with convenience and efficiency being primary drivers of adoption. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year, 85% said it resulted in equivalent or superior quality of care, with the majority reporting increased satisfaction. As the digitization of health care continues, telemedicine is poised to main- tain a pivotal role in health care delivery. Telemedicine and in-person care are not mutually exclusive, and uniting both can help reduce costs, expand access, and improve care for everyone. With further identification and im- plementation of best practices, telemedicine\u2019s capacity to personalize care models, promote continuity of care, and improve patient outcomes will only get stronger.\nReport Introduction 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Introduction 03 Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 04 An analysis of fee-for-service Medicare telemedicine claims throughout 2022 revealed that nearly 47% of billing physicians were users of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform. In the last quarter of 2022 (October to December) alone, Doximity's telemedicine tools were used by over 375,000 unique clinicians.* To gain a deeper understanding of the progression and sustained utilization of telemedicine, Doximity conducted an analysis of how its physician members, across all specialties and practice areas, used its telemedicine tools throughout 2022. To supplement this data, Doximity conducted a survey of over 1,200 of its physician telemedicine users across nine specialties: cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and psychiatry.\n*As reported on February 9, 2023 during Doximity\u2019s Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter earnings call 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 05 Physician Insights Telemedicine Insights from Doximity's Physician Membership 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 06 The metro areas with the highest physician adoption of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform in 2022 ranged across all regions of the U.S. New York had the highest overall adoption of telemedicine among physicians, followed by Chicago and Boston.\nMetro Areas with the HIGHEST HIGHEST Adoption 1.

This trend may be attributed to telemedicine\u2019s ability to promote continuity of care and long-term patient-physician relationships. Among all physicians surveyed, over 83% reported they found telemedicine useful in enhancing continuity of care for patients with complex or chronic conditions, and nearly two-thirds (65%) said telemedicine improved communication with their patients. 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 08 Adoption by Specialty Adoption of Telemedicine Highest in Specialties that Manage Chronic Illness 1.

With telemedicine, patients now have access to subspecialists which may not be available in their area. In addition, follow ups for things like adjusting a heart failure therapy can be done via telemedicine, eliminating the need for patients to drive long distances for a short office visit. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve learned telemedicine is not a replacement, but a complement to our practices. \u2013 Munir Janmohamed, MD, Medical Director Heart Failure, Dignity Health Medical Foundation 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 09 As health care becomes more digitized, physicians across specialties are integrating telemedicine into their practices. In a survey of Doximity's telemedicine users, nearly 84% of physicians reported using telemedicine at least weekly, with 40% incorporating it into their daily clinical practice. The highest reports of daily use were among psych- iatrists at 84%, followed by endocrinologists at 57%. Looking ahead, the increasing popularity of mobile medicine and remote patient monitoring devices \u2014 estimated to reach 60.6 million U.S. patients by 20243 \u2014\u00ad is likely to drive further demand for reliable and complementary telemedicine solutions.\nFrequency of Use Many Physicians Incorporating Telemedicine into Daily, Weekly Practice *May not sum to 100 due to rounding numbers.\nHow often do you use telemedicine (via voice, video, text, etc.) in your practice?* Monthly 11% Quarterly 3% None of the Above 3% Participant None of the Ab Quarterly Monthly Daily Weekly 44% 40% 11% 3% 3% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 1 Daily 40% Weekly 44% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine As physicians lean into digital, they are embracing multiple telemedicine modalities, with video emerging as the most predominant among physicians surveyed. Audio-only phone visits are also widely employed, demonstrating the need for telemedicine tools that are versatile and adaptable to patients\u2019 needs. According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, Medicare patients with less technology access, lack of video experience, Latinx ethnicity, or limited English pro- ficiency, were all more likely to be offered telephone visits compared to video visits.4 These findings underscore the importance of audio-only options and the ongoing need for inclusive, flexible, and accessible telemedicine and product features that meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population.

While one of the most predominant applications among physicians is routine follow-up visits (92% of physicians surveyed), the majority of physicians surveyed (57%) use telemedicine to discuss lab and test results and treatment options with their patients, and this is even higher among oncologists (70%). Telemedicine also offers an important channel for prescription refills and timely follow-ups after a missed in-person visit, while playing a non-trivial role in remote patient monitoring, patient triage and urgent care. Notably, a recent study conducted by Epic Research found that most patients who had a telemedicine visit did not require an in-person follow-up appointment within the same specialty for three months. These findings suggest that telemedicine can provide effective medical attention without the need for additional in-person visits.5 Adoption by Use Case Telemedicine's Role Extends Beyond Routine Care How Physicians Apply Telemedicine in Clinical Practice: Routine Follow-Up Patient Visits Patient Consults Patient Triage Remote Patient Monitoring Test Results and Treatment Options Follow-Ups After Missed In-Person Visits Medication Management Urgent Care 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 12 While the pandemic certainly increased telemedicine use, the opportunity for better time management could help explain its continued adoption. Two-thirds of all physicians surveyed (66%) reported at least one time management benefit, such as greater autonomy and work-life balance, increased productivity, and easier schedule management. In fact, the majority of physicians surveyed reported telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules. As physicians continue to navigate burnout and overwork, these benefits could drive even greater adoption of telemedicine in the future.\nEffects on Productivity, Work-Life Balance Physicians Report Better Time Management \"Telemedicine has made it easier to manage my schedule.\" \"Telemedicine helps me be more productive and better serve my patients.\" \"Telemedicine has provided me with greater autonomy and work-life balance.\" \"Telemedicine helps me to provide care to more patients per day.\" Physician-Reported Benefits of Telemedicine Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 13 Telemedicine is also instrumental in addressing the costly and disruptive issue of patient no-shows for doctor visits. Approximately 61% of physicians surveyed reported a reduction in their patient no-show rates as a result of telemedicine, likely due to the increased convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of virtual care visits. Importantly, 77% of physicians said they have observed either equivalent or improved patient adherence to treatment plans through telemedicine, with less than 2% reporting decreased adherence.\nEffects on Patient Visit, Treatment Adherence Reduces No-Show Rates, Improves or Maintains Adherence to Treatment Plans How has telemedicine affected your patients' adherence to treatment plans?* Not applicable 1 Not applicable 1% Decreased adherence 2% Unsure 21% Increased adherence 37% No change 40% 1 Decreased adherence 2% No change in adherence 40% Increased adherence 37% *May not sum to 100, due to rounding numbers.\nUnsure 21% Not applicable 1% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 14 Patient access also appears to be a leading contributor to telemedicine adoption. Nearly 88% of physicians surveyed said telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, particularly among populations that may have faced barriers to care previously. Similarly, 87% of physicians reported telemedicine has enabled them to provide care to patients who face obstacles visiting their office in person. As additional benefits, nearly 44% of physicians found that telemedicine has actually reduced wait times for their patients, while 41% said telemedicine has expanded their community reach and referral networks.\nEffects on Patient Access Physicians Report Improved Access, Reduced Wait Times for Patients Physicians Who Agree Telemedicine Has Increased Patient Access to Health Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree 88 Neutral 10 Disagree 3 Disagree 3% Neutral 10% Agree 87% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Among all physicians surveyed, over 78% indicated they believe there should be pay parity between telemedicine and in-person visits, and nearly 84% said the ability to practice telemedicine across state lines is critical to improving patient access to specialists and other timely care. With a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034,1 telemedicine is likely to play a significant role in promoting patient access to care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.\nPolicies to Preserve Patient Access Pay Parity, Licensing Across State Lines Critical to Patient Access Percentage of Physicians Who Agree There Should Be Pay Parity Between Telemedicine and In-Person Visits Percentage of Physicians Who Agree Ability to Practice Telemedicine Across State Lines is Critical to Improving Patient Access to Specialists, Other Timely Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree Neutral Disagree Disagree 4% Neutral 12% Agree 84% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Survey respondents included 1,200 patients who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 patients who did not. Among all respondents surveyed, the majority reported participating in a telemedicine visit within the last year (between March 2022 to March 2023). The following analyses examine these patients' direct experiences with telemedicine, as well as broader trends and preferences among the full patient cohort.\nPatient Insights Tracking Patient Perception and Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 19 In 2022, telemedicine reached the 80% adoption mark overall, becoming the preferred channel for prescription care and minor illness.6 While this is a significant milestone, the frequency of telemedicine use is also noteworthy. Based on survey results, nearly 60% of patients who had a telemedicine visit in the past year participated in a minimum of three virtual visits. Over one in five (21%) participated in six or more visits, and this frequency was similar among patients with and without chronic illnesses. Further, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported it improved their access to health care services.\nTelemedicine Use Among Patients Patients Report Recurring Use of Telemedicine Within One-Year Period In the past year, how many times did you meet with a doctor virtually?* Has virtual care improved your access to health care services?* *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nFundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold 6+ times 21 3-5 times 38 1-2 times 41 41% 38% 21% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundrais Participant Unsure No No Change Yes 76% 17% 5% 2% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 3-5 Times 38% No 5% Unsure 2% 1-2 Times 41% Yes 76% 6+ Times 21% No Change 17% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 20 Patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year identified a number of reasons for adoption, with efficiency and convenience being primary drivers. Telemedicine enables patients to consult with their doctors from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to interrupt their daily routines or commute to a doctor's office. Importantly, more than one in four patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year reported opting for a virtual visit because they did not believe their situation warranted an in-person appointment. This suggests that telemedicine could play a vital role in ensuring patients less inclined to visit a doctor's office still receive timely medical evaluation. In fact, the majority of all patients surveyed (70%) indicated they may be more likely to consult with a doctor in a non-emergency situation if the visit could be conducted virtually.\nFactors Driving Telemedicine Adoption Efficiency, Convenience Leading Drivers of Patient Adoption *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nWhy did you see your doctor virtually within the past year?* Easier than in-person visit (more convenient) Faster than in-person visit Concerns about COVID-19 and other infections Didn't feel in-person was needed (didn't feel bad enough) Difficulty getting to doctors office Couldn't miss work 0 60 45 30 15 53% 43% 31% 27% 26% 16% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 21 Over the past year, patients participated in telemedicine visits to receive a number of health care services, ranging from routine check-ups to appointments to discuss test results and treatment options. While follow-up appointments appear to be one of the primary applications of telemedicine use, this is likely due to the comprehensive nature of these visits, which can encompass various health care services. Among all patients who had a virtual care visit in the past year, approximately one in three patients (34%) used telemedicine to discuss their medications with their doctor or to refill their prescriptions, while roughly one in five used telemedicine to review test or treatment options. Notably, some of the highest use of telemedicine for these services was among patients with chronic illnesses.\nAdoption by Health Care Service Strong Telemedicine Adoption for Routine Visits, Medication Management What type(s) of care have you received virtually in the past year?\nFollow-ups after an in-person visit Regular check-ups Medication management and refills Review of test or lab results Mental health appointments Review of test or treatment options Same-day appointments (non-emergency) Urgent or emergency care Remote monitoring device check-up 0 50 38 25 13 46% 36% 34% 32% 25% 20% 17% 11% 9% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 22 Patients are also embracing a variety of telemedicine modalities to cater to their diverse needs and preferences. These modalities include video consultations, audio-only phone calls, and chat or text messaging. Among all patients surveyed, video emerged as the most preferred modality, with audio- only phone visits closely behind. These relatively strong preferences across modalities underscore the need for adaptable and flexible telemedicine solutions that can promote a positive patient experience for all.\nPreferences by Modality Patients Report Similar Preferences for Video, Audio-Only Visits Which types of virtual care formats do you prefer?\nAll Patients Patients with Telemedicine Visit in Past Year Video Phone (audio only) Chat or text messaging I prefer to meet with my doctor in person 15 0 30 45 60 42% 56% 39% 46% 27% 31% 27% 13% Computer (laptop/desktop) 51% Tablet or iPad 38% Home phone or basic cell phone 20% Wi-Fi or Internet 54% Among all patients surveyed, the majority (77%) reported having regular access to a smartphone, making it the most commonly available device for virtual health care visits.

Moving forward, uniting telemedicine with in-person care will help personalize care models, promote more equitable access to care, and strengthen the overall health care system for all. By leveraging the advantages of both telemedicine and in-person care, physicians as well as care teams can create flexible and adaptable models that better meet the diverse needs of their patients. This flexibility could also provide much- needed support for physicians and other medical professionals, as they continue to navigate a complex and evolving health care landscape.\nConclusion, Methodology & Sources Conclusion 27 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 28 Physician Insights Medicare Telemedicine Insights: Doximity partnered with CareJourney, a health analytics organization, to measure the number of physicians billing a set of Medicare telemedicine codes throughout 2022.

COVID-19 patients who were isolated and received HBIC were monitored through telephone consultations (TC), in-person TC visits, and a self-reporting application. By evaluating patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC, healthcare providers could gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the HBIC program.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study design enrolled 444 HBIC patients who answered a structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model assessed the association between independent variables and patient satisfaction. The length of stay in HBIC was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. The data collection started on April (1\u201330), 2022, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nResults: The median age was 34, and 247 (55.6%) were females. A greater proportion (313, 70.5%) of the participants had high satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AOR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those who were symptomatic (AOR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were found to be significant factors for high user satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and more in-person visits (>1 visit) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001) had greater chances to reduce the length of stay in the COVID-19 HBIC.\nConclusion: 70.5% of the participants had high satisfaction with the system, and frequent phone call follow-ups on patients\u2019 clinical status can significantly improve their satisfaction and length of recovery. An in-person visit is also an invaluable factor in a patient\u2019s recovery.\n1 Introduction\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on numerous countries, resulting in a staggering number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Specifically, 774,771,942 confirmed cases and 7,035,337 deaths were reported globally. In Africa, approximately 9,576,309 confirmed cases and 175,500 deaths have been recorded, whereas Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths (1). Given the outbreak\u2019s severity and the prevailing epidemiological situation, the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia has taken swift action by developing, approving, and implementing a national guide on home-based isolation and care (HBIC). This guide is tailored for asymptomatic and mildly confirmed COVID-19 cases (2). Consequently, many patients have enrolled in the system, establishing a comprehensive telephone consultation (TC) service. Healthcare workers from health centers have been diligently monitoring the clinical condition of these patients through regular phone calls or in-person visits (2). The national or regional COVID-19 emergency centers are available for assistance to ensure that patients receive the necessary support and information. Patients facing challenges or requiring guidance on the system\u2019s functioning, worsening symptoms, medication advice, or ambulance requests can reach these centers (2). This approach provides comprehensive care and support to individuals affected by COVID-19 in Ethiopia.\nSeveral studies have emphasized the utilization of teleconsultations (TC) in Sub-Saharan Africa amid the COVID-19 outbreak. For instance, a study conducted at the Aga Khan Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, revealed varying frequencies of TC calls over 3\u2009months, with peaks observed at 7\u2009weeks and lows at 13\u2009weeks (3). In Uganda, the Ministry of Health rolled out TC services across multiple health centers simultaneously (4). Similarly, in Cameroon, many physicians resorted to TC consultations during the pandemic, often using WhatsApp applications (5). Despite the progress in telemedicine practices, assessing the quality of care provided through these methods is crucial. Quality indicators for telemedicine outcomes include mortality rates, average length of stay, and complication rates (6). The adoption of telemedicine has played a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of diagnosis and treatment in primary public hospitals (7). This is evident in the reduction of treatment duration, decrease in the average length of hospital stays, and decline in the percentage of critically ill patients (8). Moreover, telemedicine aids in improving personalized care and broadening the accessibility of medical services. Healthcare providers can deliver more efficient and effective patient care by harnessing telemedicine, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (9, 10). Patient satisfaction is a significant indicator of the societal perception of healthcare services, particularly in telemedicine. The practical advantages of telemedicine further underscore its social reputation within primary healthcare facilities. First, Telemedicine plays a crucial role in alleviating the financial burden on patients and their families by eliminating expenses associated with transportation and accommodation (11). Second, the efficient nature of telemedicine expedites disease diagnosis and treatment, thereby mitigating patients\u2019 suffering (11). Lastly, telemedicine\u2019s unique \u201cface-to-face\u201d communication system fosters a novel connection between medical professionals and patients, ultimately enhancing the healthcare experience (12, 13). Despite numerous studies, the findings remain inconclusive and conflicting. Some researchers suggested recruiting adaptable patients who embrace this new technology\u2019s convenience (14). Conversely, others highlight limitations, such as the relative novelty of telehealth in medicine, which makes it challenging to compare its outcomes with those of more traditional interventions (15). In addition, patient satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors. However, the factors influencing patient satisfaction in different settings or conditions remain debated (15).\nPatient satisfaction and length of stay are crucial metrics for assessing the quality of healthcare programs. This study aimed to provide insights into the factors influencing the satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC of COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This study uses traditional care (TC) and hybrid (in-person-TC) approaches in different sub-city areas. By understanding these factors, policymakers can develop strategic plans to improve the quality of healthcare services, thereby ensuring high satisfaction levels and shorter medical residence stays. The findings of this study can also inform the National Public Health Emergency Operation Center and the Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia on how to intervene and strengthen the healthcare system. In addition, the results can contribute to expanding telemedicine services and adopting digital health technologies in the country\u2019s healthcare sector.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Study area\nThis study focuses on Addis Ababa, primarily because of the significant burden of COVID-19 cases. Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths, with nearly 67% of these cases originating in Addis Ababa (1). Moreover, implementing the COVID-19 HBIC model in Addis Ababa surpasses other regions. Furthermore, the HBIC\u2019s self-reporting and follow-up application is exclusively available in Addis Ababa, making it an ideal location for research. Addis Ababa is divided into 11 sub-cities [Addis Ketema, Akaky Kaliti, Arada, Bole, Gullele, Kirkos, Kolfe Keranio, Lideta, Nefas Silk-Lafto, Yeka, Lemi Kura (New)], all of which have adopted the HBIC system for COVID-19 patients since the initial case was identified. The digital follow-up tool was specifically launched in the Bole sub-city (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Addis Ababa district locations. This map of the 11 Addis Ababa sub-cities is included in this study. Lemi Kura is a new district and is not included in this map.\n2.2 Study period\nThe study was conducted from 1 to 30 April 2022 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.3 Telemedicine medical team and technology\nEach sub-city is equipped with two to four health centers that serve as the base for the telemedicine medical team. A well-established system ensures that patient data is promptly transmitted to follow-up teams, enabling healthcare workers to initiate their follow-up procedures without delay. To support this initiative, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Addis Ababa Health Bureau allocated a tablet with complimentary airtime to each sub-city proportionate to the needs of the telemedicine medical team.\n2.4 Population studied\nThis study encompasses all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were isolated, received care at home, and met the criteria for inclusion. The study population consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to HBIC from its inception, aged between 18 and 60, individuals who underwent regular follow-up assessments while at HBIC, and those whose contact information was documented in the registry.\n2.5 Patient\u2019s independent variables\nPatients were classified based on the following criteria: Gender (male, female), Age (<30, 31\u201340, 41\u201350, 51\u201360\u2009years), city of residence, education level (no education and elementary, secondary and diploma, degree and above), occupation (government employee, private employee, self-employee, not working), symptoms (asymptomatic, symptomatic), type of attention (only telephone call\u2014TC, telephone call with in-person visits - in-person-TC), frequency of calls (\u22642 calls, \u22653 calls), and frequency of in-person visits (no visits, \u22642 visits, \u22653 visits).\n2.6 Study design\nA cross-sectional research design assessed two primary variables: patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC in days. The formula for a single population proportion was applied to determine the required population size of 385 (with a Z-score of 1.96, an outcome proportion of 50%, and a marginal error of 5%). The technique of proportionate stratified sampling involved dividing the entire population into 11 strata or sub-cities. The total sample size was then distributed proportionally among each sub-city based on the burden of the disease. Study participants were selected from each stratum or sub-city using systematic probability sampling (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Data collection. Sampling technique from each sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.7 Data collection tools, techniques, and quality assurance\nA validated patient satisfaction survey from the teleneurology program in Chile (13) employed a Likert scale to assess the extent of patient satisfaction. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected, a pretest was conducted on a random sample of 23 (5%) patients. Based on the findings from the pretest, necessary amendments were made to the data collection tool. Additionally, the collected data underwent daily reviews for clarity and completeness checks. Before analysis, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was evaluated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha test (13). The local language was used during data collection to ensure the required information was collected with greater understanding. To facilitate this, the data collection questionnaire was first developed in English and then translated into Amharic, and the data collected were back-translated to English for consistency. The data collectors administered the questionnaire over the telephone, and responses were recorded on the individual datasheets. Training on the basics of the questionnaire and how to use it appropriately was given by the principal investigator for two BSc nurses for 2\u2009days.\n2.8 Patient satisfaction survey\nThe final questionnaire consisted of 17 closed-response questions, each assigned a numerical value ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The questions were categorized into four contextualized areas. The overall score on the questionnaire, with a maximum of 85 points, served as an indicator of patient satisfaction. The scoring system classified satisfaction levels as follows: very low (17 points or below), low (18\u201334 points), moderate (35\u201351 points), high (52\u201368 points), and very high (69\u201385 points). Following completion of the survey, patients were divided into two main groups based on their scores: (i) those with a score below 51 points, indicating moderate or low patient satisfaction, and (ii) those with a score over 52 points, indicating high or very high patient satisfaction (Table 1).\nTable 1. Study questionnaire.\r\n\n2.9 Data and outcomes analysis\nSummary statistics, including frequency, percentage, median, and interquartile range, were utilized to summarize the characteristics of patients and other relevant information. This research aimed to assess the relationship between the independent variables and two primary outcomes: (i) the level of patient satisfaction and (ii) the length of stay in the HBIC. The binary logistic regression (Backwald) model was employed to examine the independent variables associated with patient satisfaction, and the findings were presented as odds ratios (OR). Cox regression (Backwald) analysis was conducted to evaluate the independent variables linked to the length of stay in HBIC, and the results were reported as hazard ratios (HR). To compare the means of length of stay in HBIC, a non-normal distribution, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for independent samples was employed, while the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. The significance level was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 26.\n2.10 Ethical considerations\nThe study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee. Oral informed consent was obtained from the participants before any form of data collection. Participants\u2019 contact information was obtained after a formal request was made to the Addis Ababa Health Bureau. Demographic data of all participants and survey responses were anonymously collected and entered. Access to the collected information was limited to the authors, and confidentiality was maintained throughout the project.\n3 Results\n3.1 Data collection\nA 17-question structured questionnaire was developed by reviewing similar studies (Table 1) (13). Upon completing a reliability assessment of the survey, the internal reliability of the survey was robust, as evidenced by a Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of 0.96 (data not shown). The study included 509 patients, yielding a response rate of 87.2% (n\u2009=\u2009444). Among the non-respondents (n\u2009=\u200965, 12.8%), the reasons provided for their lack of participation were as follows: 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) had incorrect contact information, and another 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) did not receive any follow-up, either in-person or through phone communication. The remaining 60% (n\u2009=\u200939) of participants displayed uncooperative behavior, as their phones were inactive, unreachable, or did not answer (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Patient\u2019s response from telephone calls. Response rate and reasons for non-response include: (i) wrong phone number, (ii) no follow-up, and (iii) other.\n3.2 Population description, patient satisfaction, and length of stay in HBIC\nThe descriptive statistics of the 444 patients who participated in the study are below. The median age was 34\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years, with an age distribution as follows: Age:<30 (n\u2009=\u2009164, 36.9%); 31\u201340 (n\u2009=\u2009141, 31.8%); 41\u201350 (n\u2009=\u200987, 19.6%); and 51\u201360 (n\u2009=\u200952, 11.7%). The gender distribution of the patients was as follows: Female 247 (55.6%) (Table 2). We outline the performance of the HBIC system according to the patient satisfaction parameter. Due to the low frequency obtained in the lower user satisfaction groups (very low, low, and moderate), we grouped patients into two major groups according to the degree of user satisfaction: low or moderate and high or very high. patients with high or very high user satisfaction represent 313 (70.5%). When we break down this group by gender, we see that women have a slightly higher percentage of high or very high user satisfaction than men, with 177 (56.9%) females. However, no statistically significant differences are observed. Analyzing the distribution of patients with high and very high user satisfaction by age, we observe that more than 50% of patients are concentrated in a population under 40\u2009years old (Table 2). The length of stay for patients with high or very high satisfaction varied depending on certain variables. The average length of stay for females was 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, while for males, it was 16\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, and in terms of age groups, patients showed similar lengths between 14 and 16 days (Table 2).\nTable 2. Patient\u2019s demographic variables.\r\n\nThe distribution of patients according to sub-city of residence was found to be quite homogeneous, with some exceptions as detailed below: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200962, 14.0%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Arada (n\u2009=\u200943, 9.7%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200977, 17.3%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200959, 13.3%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u200911, 2.5%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200936, 8.1%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200922, 5.0%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u200916, 3.6%). Patients with high or very high satisfaction were distributed according to sub-city of residence as follows: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200948, 10.8%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200935), Arada (n\u2009=\u200932, 7.2%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200957, 12.8%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%, 7.9%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u20096, 1.4%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200923, 5.2%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200920, 4.5%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200918, 4.1%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u20098, 1.8%) (Table 2). Regarding the city of origin, the average length of stay varied as follows: Addis Ketema (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Akaki Kality (16\u2009\u00b1\u20098), Arada (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Bole (14\u2009\u00b1\u20093), Gulele (17\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Kirkos (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Kolfe Keranyo (16\u2009\u00b1\u20096), Lideta (14\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Nefas Silk Lafto (20\u2009\u00b1\u20097), Yeka (15\u2009\u00b1\u20097), and Lemi Kura (14\u2009\u00b1\u20097) (Table 2).\nThe patient\u2019s satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC can be influenced by various factors, including the patient\u2019s level of education and occupation. The distribution of patients\u2019 education level is as follows: 79 patients (17.8%) had no education or only completed elementary school, 174 patients (39.2%) had completed secondary school or obtained a diploma, and 191 patients (43.0%) had a degree or higher education. The distribution of patients\u2019 occupation is as follows: 121 patients (27.3%) were government employees, 114 patients (25.7%) were private employees, 120 patients (25.0%) were self-employed, and 89 patients (20.0%) were not working (Table 2). The majority of patients who showed high or very high user satisfaction have higher levels of education: Education: No Educ and Elementary (n\u2009=\u200945, 10.1%), Secondary and Diploma (n\u2009=\u2009125, 28.2%), Degree and above (n\u2009=\u2009143, 32.2%); however, the distribution was found to be more symmetrical according to the occupational level of these patients: Government employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.0%), Private employee (n\u2009=\u200985, 19.1%), Self-employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.1%), Not working (n\u2009=\u200968, 15.3%) (Table 2). No significant differences were found in the duration length of stay in HBIC among patients concerning their level of education and occupation type. The respective data for education are as follows: No Education and Elementary 14\u2009\u00b1\u20097, Secondary and Diploma 15\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Degree and above 17\u2009\u00b1\u20095. Similarly, the data for occupation type were: Government employee 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Private employee 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Self-employee 16\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Not working 18\u2009\u00b1\u20097 (Table 2).\nMost patients who participated in this study were symptomatic, accounting for 275 (61.9%) with an average length of stay for HBIC of 16 (\u00b16). Patients who displayed symptoms were more satisfied (n\u2009=\u2009215, 48.5%) than those who were asymptomatic (n\u2009=\u200998, 22.1%). The length of stay in HBIC for asymptomatic patients (14\u2009\u00b1\u20095), was slightly lower than that of Symptomatic patients (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095). However, no statistically significant differences were observed (data not shown).\nNext, we described the frequency of phone call follow-ups for patients during their stay at HBIC. The most common type of care was TC, with 330 patients (74.3%), followed by in-person and TC visits, with 114 patients (25.7%). The overall frequency of in-person visits was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20092 visits, and it can be further broken down as follows: no visits (n\u2009=\u2009330, 48.9%), \u22642 visits (n\u2009=\u200984, 18.9%), and\u2009\u2265\u20093 visits (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%). The average frequency of phone call follow-ups was 3\u2009\u00b1\u20096 calls, and we observe that the distribution of calls appears to be symmetrical: TC was \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009221, 49.8%) and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls (n\u2009=\u2009223, 50.2%).\nIn terms of the mode of care, patients who were exclusively contacted through teleconsultation (TC) 217 (48.9%) were more satisfied than those receiving hybrid care with both TC and in-person visits 96 (21.6%). Consistent with the findings, patients exhibited higher user satisfaction with an increased frequency of calls in TC, as those patients with more than \u22653 calls (n\u2009=\u2009184, 41.4%) expressed greater satisfaction compared to patients with less than or equal to \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009129, 29.1%) (Table 2). Upon analyzing the frequency of in-person visits, patients with fewer visits reported higher user satisfaction: No visits (n\u2009=\u2009217, 69.3%), 1 visit (n\u2009=\u200970, 22.0%), and\u2009\u2265\u20092 visits (n\u2009=\u200926, 8.3%).\nIt is important to mention that differences in patient length of stay were observed according to the type of care, as patients treated through the TC system 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095 stayed for a shorter period than those receiving hybrid care through TC and in-person visits 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). As expected, patients with more calls stayed longer in the HBIC system as described below: Frequency of calls in TC: \u22642 calls 13\u2009\u00b1\u20093, and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Table 2).\n3.3 Statistical analysis associated with patient satisfaction\nA binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to explore the variables associated with high or very high patient satisfaction levels. The results revealed that individuals who placed more than three calls (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those displaying symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were more inclined to report increased satisfaction. Nevertheless, no statistically significant relationships were found between user satisfaction and the other independent variables investigated (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 3).\nTable 3. Relevant demographic variables that influence patient satisfaction.\r\n\n3.4 Statistical analysis associated with patient length of stay in HBIC\nA Cox regression analysis was employed to examine the factors influencing the duration of hospital stays in patients who reported high levels of satisfaction. The findings revealed that patients who made more than three phone calls had a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000), indicating a greater likelihood of reducing their length of stay. Similarly, patients with more in-person visits also exhibited a lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). However, no statistically significant associations were observed between the length of stay and the other independent variables analyzed (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 4).\nTable 4. Cox regression analysis to elucidate the demographic variables associated with the length of stay in HBIC and patients\u2019 satisfaction.\r\n\n3.5 Statistical analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC\nPreviously, we identified the following variables that significantly influence patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC: the presence of symptoms, the number of phone calls, and in-person follow-ups. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between symptoms and patient satisfaction with the number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups (Table 5). It was noted that symptomatic patients with low or moderate satisfaction levels have an OR\u2009=\u20095.7 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and 7.6 times higher likelihood of having in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was notably longer for those with a higher number of phone calls. Conversely, patients with high or very high satisfaction levels have a 2.3 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was significantly longer for those with in-person follow-up. Sig p\u2009<\u20090.05 (Table 5).\nTable 5. Analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC.\r\n\n4 Discussion\nThis study aimed to evaluate the levels of patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC among COVID-19 patients while also examining the different factors that may impact these outcomes. Given the considerable number of COVID-19-positive instances and the limited bed availability at COVID-19-specific hospitals, the HBIC endorsed the practice of home isolation for COVID-19-affected persons. This directive was instituted because most COVID-19 patients were either asymptomatic or displayed mild symptoms. Such cases generally do not necessitate hospitalization at COVID-19-designated medical facilities and can be adequately managed at home with appropriate medical guidance and monitoring. The heightened level of patient satisfaction observed in symptomatic individuals treated by HBIC is supported by an associated investigation conducted through a survey-based study (10, 16\u201318).\nWe identified a noteworthy connection between a high or very high satisfaction level and the frequency of phone call follow-ups in patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Essentially, for each increment of one in the frequency of phone call follow-ups, the chances of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction rose by a factor of 2.8 (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000). This tendency may be attributed to patients encountering difficulties during their healthcare facility stay, and regular communication with the follow-up team assists in addressing some of these challenges. As per the National HBIC Guideline, the frequency of phone call follow-ups escalates as the severity of the COVID-19 illness worsens, with follow-ups occurring once a week, every 3\u2009days until discharge, and daily until discharge (19). Correspondingly, individuals exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms had 2.0 times greater odds of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction than those with asymptomatic disease (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Cox regression analysis uncovered a negative correlation between the length of stay in HBIC patients with high or very high satisfaction and the frequency of phone calls, follow-ups, and in-person visits. Specifically, the number of phone calls and in-person visits (with a minimum of two visits) emerged as significant factors impacting the length of stay. Upon adjusting for other variables, it was observed that with each additional phone call, the length of stay in the hospital-based isolation center (HBIC) decreased by 46.3% (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000). Similarly, after accounting for other covariates, the length of stay among COVID-19 patients who had more than one in-person visit was 50.5% lower compared to patients with no in-person visits (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Finally, this investigation determined that symptomatic patients with Low or Moderate satisfaction had a greater likelihood of experiencing a larger Number of Phone Calls, In-Person follow-ups, and a longer stay at HBIC compared to patients with high or very high satisfaction.\nUser satisfaction and length of stay have shown dissimilar results in different latitudes. A study conducted in general and university hospitals in the Netherlands found no evidence of a correlation between the average length of stay in hospital wards and patient satisfaction (20). Several studies conducted at the Nancy University Hospital Center in France and in training hospitals in Turkey and Japan (21\u201323) have found a connection between prolonged lengths of stay and decreased patient satisfaction. These studies have highlighted the importance of environmental factors in influencing patient satisfaction (24). However, a distinct study carried out in teaching hospitals in Turkey discovered that patients who stayed longer expressed higher satisfaction levels than those with shorter stays (25). Despite these variations, one can speculate about the reasons for higher user satisfaction in patients with greater follow-ups. Among these reasons, it can be argued that it is well-documented that telemedicine technology has the potential to enhance the quality of primary medical care, shorten the duration of treatment, and decrease the number of severe hospitalization cases (17). Telemedicine expands the availability of medical services and broadens the range of medical care, which is particularly crucial in Ethiopia, with a fragmented healthcare system and limited coverage (26, 27). The sharing of medical resources is especially significant for rural or isolated areas, and telemedicine offers a greater abundance of advanced medical resources for primary hospital consultations in these vast rural regions, thereby enhancing the quality of medical and healthcare services (10, 28, 29).\nThe incorporation of telemedicine into the healthcare systems of low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Ethiopia, has the potential to bring about cost savings and resource conservation in the long run. Consequently, this could alleviate the financial burden on individuals and enhance their access to affordable healthcare services (17). It is important to note that in many LMICs, a significant portion of overall health spending comes from out-of-pocket payments, as there is often no general health insurance available (30). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the already fragile healthcare systems in LMICs (10, 31). In this regard, telemedicine services could be crucial in relieving pressure on the healthcare system by saving time and resources and enhancing efficiency and accessibility. Additionally, telemedicine can facilitate social distancing measures and reduce the need for face-to-face interactions in hospitals and clinics, helping prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 through physical contact (10, 32). Furthermore, telemedicine can also be instrumental in providing counseling and specific advice to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as guidance on prevention measures. Overall, the adoption of telemedicine in LMICs holds great potential for addressing healthcare challenges, reducing costs, and improving access to quality care. It can serve as a valuable tool in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthening healthcare systems in these countries (33).\nThroughout the initial three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, most patients seeking medical care were directed to the HBIC. This strategic decision is believed to have effectively alleviated the potential burden of cases and prevented burnout among the existing treatment facilities (2). The HBIC specifically caters to COVID-19 patients and represents our country\u2019s pioneering national telehealth service. Therefore, it is crucial to examine its operational experiences thoroughly. The focus should be on integrating functionalities that encourage community acceptance of this telehealth modality. As COVID-19 patients continue to be enrolled in the HBIC, the findings from this study will serve as a valuable resource for the Ministry of Health and COVID-19 response teams in their efforts to enhance the healthcare system. The HBIC framework offers a practical solution for healthcare providers who aim to extend their services to patients residing in remote areas. Moreover, the growing acceptance and familiarity with telemedicine visits, driven by the pandemic, are likely to shape the future landscape of healthcare delivery for both patients and providers.\nThe study\u2019s findings should be evaluated considering the strengths and limitations identified. The study\u2019s strength lies in the thorough selection process of participants from various sub-cities throughout the entire duration of the service. The research questions were also carefully developed using a validated tool and assessed for internal consistency, ensuring their comprehensibility.\n4.1 Limitations\nIt is important to acknowledge a limitation of the study, which is the potential recall bias introduced by enrolling most patients during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this limitation, this study is expected to pave the way for advancements in telemedical services in Ethiopia. Furthermore, it can potentially expand and incorporate other telemedicine care modalities, such as videoconferencing, in the future.\n5 Conclusion\nThe investigation evaluated patient satisfaction and length of stay in telemedicine services. The findings revealed that most patients, accounting for over 70.5%, reported high or very high satisfaction with these services. Notably, patients who received frequent follow-up phone calls and exhibited symptomatic COVID-19 disease expressed higher satisfaction. Additionally, it was observed that a higher frequency of phone calls and in-person visits resulted in a shorter stay in the Hospital-Based Isolation Center (HBIC). Consequently, it is crucial to consider the aforementioned factors to enhance patient satisfaction and reduce the length of stay in HBIC or other telemedicine services. It is worth mentioning that the HBIC, which caters specifically to COVID-19 patients, represents the first large-scale national telemedicine service implemented in our country. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly examine the experiences gained from this service, with particular attention given to incorporating features that facilitate community acceptance and reimbursement of this mode of healthcare delivery. Meanwhile, as the enrollment of COVID-19 patients in the HBIC continues, the findings of this study will serve as a valuable resource for guiding the Ministry of Health, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, and the COVID-19 response team in their efforts to improve the system.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee.

COVID-19 patients who were isolated and received HBIC were monitored through telephone consultations (TC), in-person TC visits, and a self-reporting application. By evaluating patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC, healthcare providers could gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the HBIC program.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study design enrolled 444 HBIC patients who answered a structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model assessed the association between independent variables and patient satisfaction. The length of stay in HBIC was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. The data collection started on April (1\u201330), 2022, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nResults: The median age was 34, and 247 (55.6%) were females. A greater proportion (313, 70.5%) of the participants had high satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AOR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those who were symptomatic (AOR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were found to be significant factors for high user satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and more in-person visits (>1 visit) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001) had greater chances to reduce the length of stay in the COVID-19 HBIC.\nConclusion: 70.5% of the participants had high satisfaction with the system, and frequent phone call follow-ups on patients\u2019 clinical status can significantly improve their satisfaction and length of recovery. An in-person visit is also an invaluable factor in a patient\u2019s recovery.\n1 Introduction\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on numerous countries, resulting in a staggering number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Specifically, 774,771,942 confirmed cases and 7,035,337 deaths were reported globally. In Africa, approximately 9,576,309 confirmed cases and 175,500 deaths have been recorded, whereas Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths (1). Given the outbreak\u2019s severity and the prevailing epidemiological situation, the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia has taken swift action by developing, approving, and implementing a national guide on home-based isolation and care (HBIC). This guide is tailored for asymptomatic and mildly confirmed COVID-19 cases (2). Consequently, many patients have enrolled in the system, establishing a comprehensive telephone consultation (TC) service. Healthcare workers from health centers have been diligently monitoring the clinical condition of these patients through regular phone calls or in-person visits (2). The national or regional COVID-19 emergency centers are available for assistance to ensure that patients receive the necessary support and information. Patients facing challenges or requiring guidance on the system\u2019s functioning, worsening symptoms, medication advice, or ambulance requests can reach these centers (2). This approach provides comprehensive care and support to individuals affected by COVID-19 in Ethiopia.\nSeveral studies have emphasized the utilization of teleconsultations (TC) in Sub-Saharan Africa amid the COVID-19 outbreak. For instance, a study conducted at the Aga Khan Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, revealed varying frequencies of TC calls over 3\u2009months, with peaks observed at 7\u2009weeks and lows at 13\u2009weeks (3). In Uganda, the Ministry of Health rolled out TC services across multiple health centers simultaneously (4). Similarly, in Cameroon, many physicians resorted to TC consultations during the pandemic, often using WhatsApp applications (5). Despite the progress in telemedicine practices, assessing the quality of care provided through these methods is crucial. Quality indicators for telemedicine outcomes include mortality rates, average length of stay, and complication rates (6). The adoption of telemedicine has played a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of diagnosis and treatment in primary public hospitals (7). This is evident in the reduction of treatment duration, decrease in the average length of hospital stays, and decline in the percentage of critically ill patients (8). Moreover, telemedicine aids in improving personalized care and broadening the accessibility of medical services. Healthcare providers can deliver more efficient and effective patient care by harnessing telemedicine, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (9, 10). Patient satisfaction is a significant indicator of the societal perception of healthcare services, particularly in telemedicine. The practical advantages of telemedicine further underscore its social reputation within primary healthcare facilities. First, Telemedicine plays a crucial role in alleviating the financial burden on patients and their families by eliminating expenses associated with transportation and accommodation (11). Second, the efficient nature of telemedicine expedites disease diagnosis and treatment, thereby mitigating patients\u2019 suffering (11). Lastly, telemedicine\u2019s unique \u201cface-to-face\u201d communication system fosters a novel connection between medical professionals and patients, ultimately enhancing the healthcare experience (12, 13). Despite numerous studies, the findings remain inconclusive and conflicting. Some researchers suggested recruiting adaptable patients who embrace this new technology\u2019s convenience (14). Conversely, others highlight limitations, such as the relative novelty of telehealth in medicine, which makes it challenging to compare its outcomes with those of more traditional interventions (15). In addition, patient satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors. However, the factors influencing patient satisfaction in different settings or conditions remain debated (15).\nPatient satisfaction and length of stay are crucial metrics for assessing the quality of healthcare programs. This study aimed to provide insights into the factors influencing the satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC of COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This study uses traditional care (TC) and hybrid (in-person-TC) approaches in different sub-city areas. By understanding these factors, policymakers can develop strategic plans to improve the quality of healthcare services, thereby ensuring high satisfaction levels and shorter medical residence stays. The findings of this study can also inform the National Public Health Emergency Operation Center and the Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia on how to intervene and strengthen the healthcare system. In addition, the results can contribute to expanding telemedicine services and adopting digital health technologies in the country\u2019s healthcare sector.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Study area\nThis study focuses on Addis Ababa, primarily because of the significant burden of COVID-19 cases. Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths, with nearly 67% of these cases originating in Addis Ababa (1). Moreover, implementing the COVID-19 HBIC model in Addis Ababa surpasses other regions. Furthermore, the HBIC\u2019s self-reporting and follow-up application is exclusively available in Addis Ababa, making it an ideal location for research. Addis Ababa is divided into 11 sub-cities [Addis Ketema, Akaky Kaliti, Arada, Bole, Gullele, Kirkos, Kolfe Keranio, Lideta, Nefas Silk-Lafto, Yeka, Lemi Kura (New)], all of which have adopted the HBIC system for COVID-19 patients since the initial case was identified. The digital follow-up tool was specifically launched in the Bole sub-city (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Addis Ababa district locations. This map of the 11 Addis Ababa sub-cities is included in this study. Lemi Kura is a new district and is not included in this map.\n2.2 Study period\nThe study was conducted from 1 to 30 April 2022 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.3 Telemedicine medical team and technology\nEach sub-city is equipped with two to four health centers that serve as the base for the telemedicine medical team. A well-established system ensures that patient data is promptly transmitted to follow-up teams, enabling healthcare workers to initiate their follow-up procedures without delay. To support this initiative, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Addis Ababa Health Bureau allocated a tablet with complimentary airtime to each sub-city proportionate to the needs of the telemedicine medical team.\n2.4 Population studied\nThis study encompasses all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were isolated, received care at home, and met the criteria for inclusion. The study population consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to HBIC from its inception, aged between 18 and 60, individuals who underwent regular follow-up assessments while at HBIC, and those whose contact information was documented in the registry.\n2.5 Patient\u2019s independent variables\nPatients were classified based on the following criteria: Gender (male, female), Age (<30, 31\u201340, 41\u201350, 51\u201360\u2009years), city of residence, education level (no education and elementary, secondary and diploma, degree and above), occupation (government employee, private employee, self-employee, not working), symptoms (asymptomatic, symptomatic), type of attention (only telephone call\u2014TC, telephone call with in-person visits - in-person-TC), frequency of calls (\u22642 calls, \u22653 calls), and frequency of in-person visits (no visits, \u22642 visits, \u22653 visits).\n2.6 Study design\nA cross-sectional research design assessed two primary variables: patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC in days. The formula for a single population proportion was applied to determine the required population size of 385 (with a Z-score of 1.96, an outcome proportion of 50%, and a marginal error of 5%). The technique of proportionate stratified sampling involved dividing the entire population into 11 strata or sub-cities. The total sample size was then distributed proportionally among each sub-city based on the burden of the disease. Study participants were selected from each stratum or sub-city using systematic probability sampling (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Data collection. Sampling technique from each sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.7 Data collection tools, techniques, and quality assurance\nA validated patient satisfaction survey from the teleneurology program in Chile (13) employed a Likert scale to assess the extent of patient satisfaction. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected, a pretest was conducted on a random sample of 23 (5%) patients. Based on the findings from the pretest, necessary amendments were made to the data collection tool. Additionally, the collected data underwent daily reviews for clarity and completeness checks. Before analysis, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was evaluated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha test (13). The local language was used during data collection to ensure the required information was collected with greater understanding. To facilitate this, the data collection questionnaire was first developed in English and then translated into Amharic, and the data collected were back-translated to English for consistency. The data collectors administered the questionnaire over the telephone, and responses were recorded on the individual datasheets. Training on the basics of the questionnaire and how to use it appropriately was given by the principal investigator for two BSc nurses for 2\u2009days.\n2.8 Patient satisfaction survey\nThe final questionnaire consisted of 17 closed-response questions, each assigned a numerical value ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The questions were categorized into four contextualized areas. The overall score on the questionnaire, with a maximum of 85 points, served as an indicator of patient satisfaction. The scoring system classified satisfaction levels as follows: very low (17 points or below), low (18\u201334 points), moderate (35\u201351 points), high (52\u201368 points), and very high (69\u201385 points). Following completion of the survey, patients were divided into two main groups based on their scores: (i) those with a score below 51 points, indicating moderate or low patient satisfaction, and (ii) those with a score over 52 points, indicating high or very high patient satisfaction (Table 1).\nTable 1. Study questionnaire.\r\n\n2.9 Data and outcomes analysis\nSummary statistics, including frequency, percentage, median, and interquartile range, were utilized to summarize the characteristics of patients and other relevant information. This research aimed to assess the relationship between the independent variables and two primary outcomes: (i) the level of patient satisfaction and (ii) the length of stay in the HBIC. The binary logistic regression (Backwald) model was employed to examine the independent variables associated with patient satisfaction, and the findings were presented as odds ratios (OR). Cox regression (Backwald) analysis was conducted to evaluate the independent variables linked to the length of stay in HBIC, and the results were reported as hazard ratios (HR). To compare the means of length of stay in HBIC, a non-normal distribution, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for independent samples was employed, while the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. The significance level was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 26.\n2.10 Ethical considerations\nThe study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee. Oral informed consent was obtained from the participants before any form of data collection. Participants\u2019 contact information was obtained after a formal request was made to the Addis Ababa Health Bureau. Demographic data of all participants and survey responses were anonymously collected and entered. Access to the collected information was limited to the authors, and confidentiality was maintained throughout the project.\n3 Results\n3.1 Data collection\nA 17-question structured questionnaire was developed by reviewing similar studies (Table 1) (13). Upon completing a reliability assessment of the survey, the internal reliability of the survey was robust, as evidenced by a Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of 0.96 (data not shown). The study included 509 patients, yielding a response rate of 87.2% (n\u2009=\u2009444). Among the non-respondents (n\u2009=\u200965, 12.8%), the reasons provided for their lack of participation were as follows: 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) had incorrect contact information, and another 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) did not receive any follow-up, either in-person or through phone communication. The remaining 60% (n\u2009=\u200939) of participants displayed uncooperative behavior, as their phones were inactive, unreachable, or did not answer (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Patient\u2019s response from telephone calls. Response rate and reasons for non-response include: (i) wrong phone number, (ii) no follow-up, and (iii) other.\n3.2 Population description, patient satisfaction, and length of stay in HBIC\nThe descriptive statistics of the 444 patients who participated in the study are below. The median age was 34\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years, with an age distribution as follows: Age:<30 (n\u2009=\u2009164, 36.9%); 31\u201340 (n\u2009=\u2009141, 31.8%); 41\u201350 (n\u2009=\u200987, 19.6%); and 51\u201360 (n\u2009=\u200952, 11.7%). The gender distribution of the patients was as follows: Female 247 (55.6%) (Table 2). We outline the performance of the HBIC system according to the patient satisfaction parameter. Due to the low frequency obtained in the lower user satisfaction groups (very low, low, and moderate), we grouped patients into two major groups according to the degree of user satisfaction: low or moderate and high or very high. patients with high or very high user satisfaction represent 313 (70.5%). When we break down this group by gender, we see that women have a slightly higher percentage of high or very high user satisfaction than men, with 177 (56.9%) females. However, no statistically significant differences are observed. Analyzing the distribution of patients with high and very high user satisfaction by age, we observe that more than 50% of patients are concentrated in a population under 40\u2009years old (Table 2). The length of stay for patients with high or very high satisfaction varied depending on certain variables. The average length of stay for females was 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, while for males, it was 16\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, and in terms of age groups, patients showed similar lengths between 14 and 16 days (Table 2).\nTable 2. Patient\u2019s demographic variables.\r\n\nThe distribution of patients according to sub-city of residence was found to be quite homogeneous, with some exceptions as detailed below: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200962, 14.0%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Arada (n\u2009=\u200943, 9.7%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200977, 17.3%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200959, 13.3%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u200911, 2.5%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200936, 8.1%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200922, 5.0%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u200916, 3.6%). Patients with high or very high satisfaction were distributed according to sub-city of residence as follows: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200948, 10.8%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200935), Arada (n\u2009=\u200932, 7.2%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200957, 12.8%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%, 7.9%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u20096, 1.4%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200923, 5.2%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200920, 4.5%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200918, 4.1%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u20098, 1.8%) (Table 2). Regarding the city of origin, the average length of stay varied as follows: Addis Ketema (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Akaki Kality (16\u2009\u00b1\u20098), Arada (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Bole (14\u2009\u00b1\u20093), Gulele (17\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Kirkos (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Kolfe Keranyo (16\u2009\u00b1\u20096), Lideta (14\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Nefas Silk Lafto (20\u2009\u00b1\u20097), Yeka (15\u2009\u00b1\u20097), and Lemi Kura (14\u2009\u00b1\u20097) (Table 2).\nThe patient\u2019s satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC can be influenced by various factors, including the patient\u2019s level of education and occupation. The distribution of patients\u2019 education level is as follows: 79 patients (17.8%) had no education or only completed elementary school, 174 patients (39.2%) had completed secondary school or obtained a diploma, and 191 patients (43.0%) had a degree or higher education. The distribution of patients\u2019 occupation is as follows: 121 patients (27.3%) were government employees, 114 patients (25.7%) were private employees, 120 patients (25.0%) were self-employed, and 89 patients (20.0%) were not working (Table 2). The majority of patients who showed high or very high user satisfaction have higher levels of education: Education: No Educ and Elementary (n\u2009=\u200945, 10.1%), Secondary and Diploma (n\u2009=\u2009125, 28.2%), Degree and above (n\u2009=\u2009143, 32.2%); however, the distribution was found to be more symmetrical according to the occupational level of these patients: Government employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.0%), Private employee (n\u2009=\u200985, 19.1%), Self-employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.1%), Not working (n\u2009=\u200968, 15.3%) (Table 2). No significant differences were found in the duration length of stay in HBIC among patients concerning their level of education and occupation type. The respective data for education are as follows: No Education and Elementary 14\u2009\u00b1\u20097, Secondary and Diploma 15\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Degree and above 17\u2009\u00b1\u20095. Similarly, the data for occupation type were: Government employee 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Private employee 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Self-employee 16\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Not working 18\u2009\u00b1\u20097 (Table 2).\nMost patients who participated in this study were symptomatic, accounting for 275 (61.9%) with an average length of stay for HBIC of 16 (\u00b16). Patients who displayed symptoms were more satisfied (n\u2009=\u2009215, 48.5%) than those who were asymptomatic (n\u2009=\u200998, 22.1%). The length of stay in HBIC for asymptomatic patients (14\u2009\u00b1\u20095), was slightly lower than that of Symptomatic patients (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095). However, no statistically significant differences were observed (data not shown).\nNext, we described the frequency of phone call follow-ups for patients during their stay at HBIC. The most common type of care was TC, with 330 patients (74.3%), followed by in-person and TC visits, with 114 patients (25.7%). The overall frequency of in-person visits was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20092 visits, and it can be further broken down as follows: no visits (n\u2009=\u2009330, 48.9%), \u22642 visits (n\u2009=\u200984, 18.9%), and\u2009\u2265\u20093 visits (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%). The average frequency of phone call follow-ups was 3\u2009\u00b1\u20096 calls, and we observe that the distribution of calls appears to be symmetrical: TC was \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009221, 49.8%) and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls (n\u2009=\u2009223, 50.2%).\nIn terms of the mode of care, patients who were exclusively contacted through teleconsultation (TC) 217 (48.9%) were more satisfied than those receiving hybrid care with both TC and in-person visits 96 (21.6%). Consistent with the findings, patients exhibited higher user satisfaction with an increased frequency of calls in TC, as those patients with more than \u22653 calls (n\u2009=\u2009184, 41.4%) expressed greater satisfaction compared to patients with less than or equal to \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009129, 29.1%) (Table 2). Upon analyzing the frequency of in-person visits, patients with fewer visits reported higher user satisfaction: No visits (n\u2009=\u2009217, 69.3%), 1 visit (n\u2009=\u200970, 22.0%), and\u2009\u2265\u20092 visits (n\u2009=\u200926, 8.3%).\nIt is important to mention that differences in patient length of stay were observed according to the type of care, as patients treated through the TC system 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095 stayed for a shorter period than those receiving hybrid care through TC and in-person visits 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). As expected, patients with more calls stayed longer in the HBIC system as described below: Frequency of calls in TC: \u22642 calls 13\u2009\u00b1\u20093, and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Table 2).\n3.3 Statistical analysis associated with patient satisfaction\nA binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to explore the variables associated with high or very high patient satisfaction levels. The results revealed that individuals who placed more than three calls (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those displaying symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were more inclined to report increased satisfaction. Nevertheless, no statistically significant relationships were found between user satisfaction and the other independent variables investigated (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 3).\nTable 3. Relevant demographic variables that influence patient satisfaction.\r\n\n3.4 Statistical analysis associated with patient length of stay in HBIC\nA Cox regression analysis was employed to examine the factors influencing the duration of hospital stays in patients who reported high levels of satisfaction. The findings revealed that patients who made more than three phone calls had a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000), indicating a greater likelihood of reducing their length of stay. Similarly, patients with more in-person visits also exhibited a lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). However, no statistically significant associations were observed between the length of stay and the other independent variables analyzed (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 4).\nTable 4. Cox regression analysis to elucidate the demographic variables associated with the length of stay in HBIC and patients\u2019 satisfaction.\r\n\n3.5 Statistical analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC\nPreviously, we identified the following variables that significantly influence patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC: the presence of symptoms, the number of phone calls, and in-person follow-ups. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between symptoms and patient satisfaction with the number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups (Table 5). It was noted that symptomatic patients with low or moderate satisfaction levels have an OR\u2009=\u20095.7 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and 7.6 times higher likelihood of having in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was notably longer for those with a higher number of phone calls. Conversely, patients with high or very high satisfaction levels have a 2.3 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was significantly longer for those with in-person follow-up. Sig p\u2009<\u20090.05 (Table 5).\nTable 5. Analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC.\r\n\n4 Discussion\nThis study aimed to evaluate the levels of patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC among COVID-19 patients while also examining the different factors that may impact these outcomes. Given the considerable number of COVID-19-positive instances and the limited bed availability at COVID-19-specific hospitals, the HBIC endorsed the practice of home isolation for COVID-19-affected persons. This directive was instituted because most COVID-19 patients were either asymptomatic or displayed mild symptoms. Such cases generally do not necessitate hospitalization at COVID-19-designated medical facilities and can be adequately managed at home with appropriate medical guidance and monitoring. The heightened level of patient satisfaction observed in symptomatic individuals treated by HBIC is supported by an associated investigation conducted through a survey-based study (10, 16\u201318).\nWe identified a noteworthy connection between a high or very high satisfaction level and the frequency of phone call follow-ups in patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Essentially, for each increment of one in the frequency of phone call follow-ups, the chances of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction rose by a factor of 2.8 (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000). This tendency may be attributed to patients encountering difficulties during their healthcare facility stay, and regular communication with the follow-up team assists in addressing some of these challenges. As per the National HBIC Guideline, the frequency of phone call follow-ups escalates as the severity of the COVID-19 illness worsens, with follow-ups occurring once a week, every 3\u2009days until discharge, and daily until discharge (19). Correspondingly, individuals exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms had 2.0 times greater odds of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction than those with asymptomatic disease (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Cox regression analysis uncovered a negative correlation between the length of stay in HBIC patients with high or very high satisfaction and the frequency of phone calls, follow-ups, and in-person visits. Specifically, the number of phone calls and in-person visits (with a minimum of two visits) emerged as significant factors impacting the length of stay. Upon adjusting for other variables, it was observed that with each additional phone call, the length of stay in the hospital-based isolation center (HBIC) decreased by 46.3% (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000). Similarly, after accounting for other covariates, the length of stay among COVID-19 patients who had more than one in-person visit was 50.5% lower compared to patients with no in-person visits (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Finally, this investigation determined that symptomatic patients with Low or Moderate satisfaction had a greater likelihood of experiencing a larger Number of Phone Calls, In-Person follow-ups, and a longer stay at HBIC compared to patients with high or very high satisfaction.\nUser satisfaction and length of stay have shown dissimilar results in different latitudes. A study conducted in general and university hospitals in the Netherlands found no evidence of a correlation between the average length of stay in hospital wards and patient satisfaction (20). Several studies conducted at the Nancy University Hospital Center in France and in training hospitals in Turkey and Japan (21\u201323) have found a connection between prolonged lengths of stay and decreased patient satisfaction. These studies have highlighted the importance of environmental factors in influencing patient satisfaction (24). However, a distinct study carried out in teaching hospitals in Turkey discovered that patients who stayed longer expressed higher satisfaction levels than those with shorter stays (25). Despite these variations, one can speculate about the reasons for higher user satisfaction in patients with greater follow-ups. Among these reasons, it can be argued that it is well-documented that telemedicine technology has the potential to enhance the quality of primary medical care, shorten the duration of treatment, and decrease the number of severe hospitalization cases (17). Telemedicine expands the availability of medical services and broadens the range of medical care, which is particularly crucial in Ethiopia, with a fragmented healthcare system and limited coverage (26, 27). The sharing of medical resources is especially significant for rural or isolated areas, and telemedicine offers a greater abundance of advanced medical resources for primary hospital consultations in these vast rural regions, thereby enhancing the quality of medical and healthcare services (10, 28, 29).\nThe incorporation of telemedicine into the healthcare systems of low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Ethiopia, has the potential to bring about cost savings and resource conservation in the long run. Consequently, this could alleviate the financial burden on individuals and enhance their access to affordable healthcare services (17). It is important to note that in many LMICs, a significant portion of overall health spending comes from out-of-pocket payments, as there is often no general health insurance available (30). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the already fragile healthcare systems in LMICs (10, 31). In this regard, telemedicine services could be crucial in relieving pressure on the healthcare system by saving time and resources and enhancing efficiency and accessibility. Additionally, telemedicine can facilitate social distancing measures and reduce the need for face-to-face interactions in hospitals and clinics, helping prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 through physical contact (10, 32). Furthermore, telemedicine can also be instrumental in providing counseling and specific advice to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as guidance on prevention measures. Overall, the adoption of telemedicine in LMICs holds great potential for addressing healthcare challenges, reducing costs, and improving access to quality care. It can serve as a valuable tool in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthening healthcare systems in these countries (33).\nThroughout the initial three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, most patients seeking medical care were directed to the HBIC. This strategic decision is believed to have effectively alleviated the potential burden of cases and prevented burnout among the existing treatment facilities (2). The HBIC specifically caters to COVID-19 patients and represents our country\u2019s pioneering national telehealth service. Therefore, it is crucial to examine its operational experiences thoroughly. The focus should be on integrating functionalities that encourage community acceptance of this telehealth modality. As COVID-19 patients continue to be enrolled in the HBIC, the findings from this study will serve as a valuable resource for the Ministry of Health and COVID-19 response teams in their efforts to enhance the healthcare system. The HBIC framework offers a practical solution for healthcare providers who aim to extend their services to patients residing in remote areas. Moreover, the growing acceptance and familiarity with telemedicine visits, driven by the pandemic, are likely to shape the future landscape of healthcare delivery for both patients and providers.\nThe study\u2019s findings should be evaluated considering the strengths and limitations identified. The study\u2019s strength lies in the thorough selection process of participants from various sub-cities throughout the entire duration of the service. The research questions were also carefully developed using a validated tool and assessed for internal consistency, ensuring their comprehensibility.\n4.1 Limitations\nIt is important to acknowledge a limitation of the study, which is the potential recall bias introduced by enrolling most patients during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this limitation, this study is expected to pave the way for advancements in telemedical services in Ethiopia. Furthermore, it can potentially expand and incorporate other telemedicine care modalities, such as videoconferencing, in the future.\n5 Conclusion\nThe investigation evaluated patient satisfaction and length of stay in telemedicine services. The findings revealed that most patients, accounting for over 70.5%, reported high or very high satisfaction with these services. Notably, patients who received frequent follow-up phone calls and exhibited symptomatic COVID-19 disease expressed higher satisfaction. Additionally, it was observed that a higher frequency of phone calls and in-person visits resulted in a shorter stay in the Hospital-Based Isolation Center (HBIC). Consequently, it is crucial to consider the aforementioned factors to enhance patient satisfaction and reduce the length of stay in HBIC or other telemedicine services. It is worth mentioning that the HBIC, which caters specifically to COVID-19 patients, represents the first large-scale national telemedicine service implemented in our country. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly examine the experiences gained from this service, with particular attention given to incorporating features that facilitate community acceptance and reimbursement of this mode of healthcare delivery. Meanwhile, as the enrollment of COVID-19 patients in the HBIC continues, the findings of this study will serve as a valuable resource for guiding the Ministry of Health, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, and the COVID-19 response team in their efforts to improve the system.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee.

Businesses that prioritize it enjoy greater loyalty, enhanced reputation, and increased sales. Bain & Company found that a 5% increase in customer retention can raise profits by 25% to 95%.\nWith 32% of customers willing to abandon a brand they love after a single bad experience, businesses must consistently deliver exceptional service. In the digital age, where reviews and word-of-mouth can make or break a brand, focusing on customer satisfaction not only retains existing clients but also attracts new ones. By addressing the key factors influencing customer satisfaction, businesses can build loyalty and drive growth.\nUnderstanding the factors that affect customer satisfaction is crucial for any business owner, or customer service manager aiming to thrive in today's competitive marketplace. By delving into deeper aspects, businesses can identify areas for improvement and tailor their strategies to meet customer expectations.\nWhat is customer satisfaction\nCustomer satisfaction refers to how well a company's products or services meet or exceed their customer's expectations. It's a critical measure of success, reflecting how happy customers are with what they\u2019ve purchased or experienced.\nWhen a business delivers on its promises \u2014 or better yet, exceeds them \u2014 it moves closer to achieving high levels of customer satisfaction. High levels of customer happiness often result in positive outcomes for businesses, such as loyalty, repeat business, positive word-of-mouth referrals, and a strong brand reputation. Conversely, low customer happiness can lead to churn, negative reviews, and a damaged brand image.\nBusinesses frequently use surveys, feedback forms, and metrics like Customer Satisfaction Scores (CSAT) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) to measure customer satisfaction, helping them identify areas for improvement. Various factors influence customer satisfaction, including product quality, customer support, ease of doing business, and the overall customer experience.\nWhy does customer satisfaction matter\nCustomer satisfaction is significant for several compelling reasons, impacting modern customer experiences in various ways:\n\nEncourages repeat business: Satisfied customers are more likely to return and make additional purchases, significantly contributing to the company's long-term revenue.\nFosters loyalty & reduces churn: High levels of customer satisfaction cultivate loyalty, making customers less inclined to switch to competitors. This loyalty not only lowers churn rates but also turns satisfied customers into brand advocates who are eager to recommend the company to others.\nAmplifies word-of-mouth marketing: Happy customers serve as powerful marketing allies. They are inclined to share positive experiences with friends, and family, and on social media, effectively acting as organic promoters of the brand's strengths. This form of word-of-mouth marketing is both highly effective and cost-efficient, rooted in genuine satisfaction and trust.\nEnhances brand reputation & competitive edge: In today's digital age, where online reviews can significantly impact a business, maintaining a strong brand reputation is crucial. Positive reviews and high satisfaction ratings establish a competitive advantage, attracting new customers who rely on the experiences of others when making purchasing decisions.\nPromotes continuous improvement: Monitoring customer satisfaction through surveys and feedback enables businesses to pinpoint both strengths and areas that require enhancement. This ongoing feedback loop empowers companies to evolve alongside their customer base, ensuring they remain relevant and responsive to changing needs and expectations.\nBoosts financial performance: Numerous studies have established a direct correlation between customer satisfaction and key business performance metrics such as sales growth, market share, and profitability. Satisfied customers typically spend more and engage in behaviors that enhance profitability, driving revenue without the proportional increase in marketing or acquisition costs usually associated with attracting new customers.\n\nBy focusing on key aspects like product quality, service efficiency, technological advancements, and personalization, businesses can cultivate a culture of customer satisfaction that drives success and growth. A robust customer support framework is essential for adapting to evolving consumer expectations and refining strategies for an enhanced overall customer experience.\n12 factors affecting customer satisfaction\nUnderstanding the factors that drive customer satisfaction is essential for any business seeking to prosper. By identifying and analyzing these factors, businesses can effectively adapt their customer satisfaction strategies to meet and exceed expectations. This ultimately strengthens client relationships and enhances their market position. Here are 12 essential factors influencing customer satisfaction:\n\nAccessibility\nEmpathy\nCommunication\nResponse time\nConvenience\nVariety of choices\nSimplicity\nQuality\nCompetitive pricing\nRecognition and appreciation\nLoyalty programs\nCommunity\n\nEach of these factors plays a crucial role in influencing customer satisfaction, thereby shaping the customer experience. Let\u2019s delve deeper into this list of the factors that influence customer satisfaction.\n1. Accessibility\nAccessibility is a measure of how easy it is to access your products and services. This can be supported through user-friendly websites or physical locations, thereby, creating a seamless experience that fosters trust and satisfaction.\nOffering multiple interaction channels\u2014like phone, email, and social media\u2014enhances the customer experience and positively influences satisfaction. When customers can easily connect with a business, it strengthens their satisfaction and fosters loyalty. Ultimately, prioritizing accessibility can significantly impact a company's success and reputation.\nMoxo streamlines communication and enhances the customer experience by consolidating resources, support, and services into one intuitive interface - a client portal. With everything at their fingertips, customers stay informed on the go, never missing important updates. This seamless interaction boosts satisfaction, fosters loyalty, and strengthens long-term relationships, ultimately elevating business success and reputation.\n2. Empathy\nEmpathy is an essential factor that contributes to building customer satisfaction and loyalty. It involves building customer relations by understanding and sharing customers' feelings through active listening and genuine care. By fostering emotional connections, brands build trust and loyalty. Moxo enhances personalized interactions as a centralized communication hub, ensuring no customer message is missed. With features like personalized messaging and video calls, you can foster authentic connections that boost customer satisfaction.\n3. Language\nClear communication is key to customer satisfaction. Using simple, relatable language helps avoid confusion, build rapport, and foster trust, enhancing the overall customer experience. Moxo enhances customer satisfaction by integrating text, email, voice, and video communication. Its user-friendly platform streamlines document sharing and real-time interactions, reducing miscommunication. With in-context messaging and spot commenting, Moxo fosters collaboration, helping businesses connect effectively and clients feel valued.\n4. Response time\nIn today's age of instant gratification, quick response times are crucial for businesses. Customers demand prompt answers, and companies that prioritize responsiveness not only meet those needs but also build stronger relationships and loyalty.\nMoxo enhances communication by replacing traditional emails with synced conversations, integrating multiple channels into one platform. This centralization streamlines customer interactions, speeds up issue resolution, and improves team collaboration, ultimately boosting response times and customer satisfaction.\n5. Convenience\nOne of the most important factors that contribute to customer satisfaction is convenience. Clients today demand services, which are served conveniently. It improves customer experiences by streamlining interactions, offering flexible payment options, easy returns, and user-friendly interfaces. Prioritizing convenience enhances satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat business, driving success and stronger connections.\nMoxo simplifies these interactions with seamless communication tools for messaging, video calls, and document sharing\u2014all on one platform. It enhances task and project management by setting deadlines for stakeholders, reducing the need for multiple apps. This streamlined approach ensures support is just a click away, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty at every step.\n6. Choices\nProviding a range of options lets customers choose what best meets their unique needs, enhancing satisfaction and fostering a personalized experience. When customers feel in control, it boosts their confidence and loyalty, leading to a more positive relationship with the brand.\nMoxo stands out in the digital landscape by seamlessly integrating third-party tools and customizable workflows into its services. This streamlined approach simplifies workflows, enabling companies to utilize familiar applications without the hassle of managing multiple platforms.\n7. Simplicity\nSimplicity is essential for reducing frustration and enhancing the customer experience. Clear processes and intuitive designs foster trust and reliability, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty. Moxo's client portals exemplify this with easy navigation, allowing hassle-free access to services. By eliminating complexity, Moxo stands out as a solution provider that truly understands client needs.\n8. Quality\nQuality of service or product is a crucial factor for customer satisfaction and business success. High-quality products and services not only exceed expectations but also build trust and loyalty. When customers feel valued, they are more likely to return and refer others.\n9. Reasonable prices\nCompetitive pricing is at the center of the list of factors that influence customer satisfaction. While customers undoubtedly seek quality products and excellent service, they also prioritize fairness and transparency in pricing. When businesses offer competitive rates, it attracts customers. By striking the right balance between quality and cost, businesses can create a positive experience that keeps customers coming back.\n10. Appreciation\nShowing appreciation to customers boosts their satisfaction. Simple gestures like personalized thank-you notes and tailored offers create lasting connections and encourage repeat business. Loyalty rewards programs foster a sense of community, enhancing the overall customer experience. Moxo exemplifies this by engaging in feedback loops to understand user needs, ensuring customers feel valued. Quick response times and regular product updates reinforce trust and satisfaction, ultimately fostering loyalty and long-term success.\n11. Loyalty programs\nLoyalty programs incentivize repeat business by rewarding customers with points, discounts, or exclusive perks. These programs offer one of the best ways to influence customer satisfaction. They enhance customer retention, deepen brand connections, and make customers feel valued. By encouraging ongoing engagement, these programs foster long-term relationships and increase satisfaction.\n12. Community\nCreating a community around a brand boosts customer satisfaction and loyalty. When customers feel connected, they build trust and engagement, leading to positive word-of-mouth. This connection not only fosters loyalty but also helps cultivate a vibrant ecosystem, driving customer retention and long-term success.\nExploring strategies to foster loyalty and ensure customer satisfaction reveals that these efforts enhance the customer experience and support sustainable business growth. Now, we\u2019ll understand how prioritizing customer happiness drives overall business performance, leading to improved profitability, reduced churn rates, and a stronger brand reputation. Let\u2019s delve into the vital link between customer satisfaction and business success.\nHow improving customer satisfaction boosts business\nImproving customer satisfaction directly boosts business success. Satisfied customers tend to make repeat purchases, leave positive reviews, and refer others, leading to lower churn rates and increased market share. High satisfaction translates into tangible growth, measurable through key performance indicators (KPIs). Here are a few important ones:\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS): The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a primary KPI influenced by customer satisfaction. It measures the likelihood of customers recommending a business to others. A high NPS signifies strong customer loyalty and can result in increased customer acquisition as satisfied clients become enthusiastic brand advocates.\nCustomer Lifetime Value (CLV): Another crucial KPI impacted by customer satisfaction is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). Satisfied customers are more likely to remain loyal over time, contributing significantly to revenue growth. By enhancing CLV, businesses can reduce acquisition costs and allocate resources more effectively, fostering further growth.\nCustomer Effort Score (CES): Customer satisfaction also affects the Customer Effort Score (CES), which assesses how easy it is to do business with a company. A lower effort score indicates higher satisfaction and can drastically cut operational costs related to support and service. This efficiency not only boosts profitability but also strengthens competitive advantage in crowded markets.\n\nInvesting in customer satisfaction leads to an upward spiral of business benefits: from fostering loyalty and advocacy to optimizing operational efficiency and improving financial performance. By prioritizing customer happiness, companies set themselves on a path toward sustainable growth and long-term success.\nHow Moxo enhances client experience and satisfaction\nMoxo enhances client experience and satisfaction with innovative solutions that streamline communication and simplify processes.
