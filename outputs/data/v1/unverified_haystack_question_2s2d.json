During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.

The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",

Notes UK overview March overall was unsettled, wet and dull. The month began colder than normal across the UK, with temperatures across the UK cooler than average and southern areas recording notably low daily minimum temperatures (for instance, Benson in Oxfordshire recorded -4.6\u00b0C on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd across parts of south west England, causing some travel disruption. However, the cool weather was replaced with milder weather for much of the rest of the month, with temperatures widely into the mid to high teens at times (for instance, a maximum of 18.8\u00b0C was recorded at Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th). Temperatures dipped again towards the end of the month, and on the 27th/28th, some areas around Plymouth and Dartmoor experienced snowy conditions overnight. Overall the weather was unsettled, with a succession of frontal systems bringing rain and wind. By mid-month, several counties including London and Kent had already provisionally experienced their whole-month average rainfall, and continued to be soaked throughout the rest of the month. The month ended on an unsettled note, with widespread showers and strong winds across the UK. Overall, the provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was much milder than areas further north, with a provisional mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C (anomaly of 1.4\u00b0C) for southern England and 5.0\u00b0C (anomaly of 0.6\u00b0C) for Scotland. England provisionally recorded the seventh-warmest March on record in a series from 1884. The UK overall recorded provisionally 127% of the long term average rainfall for March, with much of this concentrated in the south. England and Wales both recorded more than 150% of their long term average monthly rainfall, while Scotland recorded just 90% of the average March rainfall. County Down in Northern Ireland provisionally experienced its third wettest March on record (145.9mm) in a series from 1836. As well as wet, the month was also dull, with the UK provisionally recording just 95.2 hours of sunshine (87% of the long term average). Reference climatology used for calculating anomalies is the period 1991-2020 unless otherwise stated. Weather impacts \u2022 Snow across Ireland, southwest Midlands and the Bristol area caused traffic disruption and road closures \u2022 Persistent rain across the country throughout the month, particularly in southern England, caused groundwater and surface water flooding March started with heavy snow across southern and western parts of Northern Ireland, with the Enniskillen area reporting numerous traffic incidents and several fallen trees as a result of the snow. Parts of the Peak District and south Pennines also experienced snow, with several roads reported closed for a period. Further south, a heavy hail storm in Sussex on the 1st may have contributed to a major road traffic collision on the M23. Further snow on the 2nd hit the south-western Midlands and Bristol area, with reports of several snow-related traffic incidents and the use of snow ploughs to clear a section of the M4. The rest of the month saw unsettled weather with regular bouts of rain. Ongoing groundwater flooding in Suffolk that began in February continued well into March, bringing significant traffic disruption. However, there was otherwise relatively little in the way of impactful rain up until the final week of the month. The last week of March brought rain, snow, and strong winds. Heavy rain in Cornwall on the 25th/26th as a result of a stalling weather front led to flooding; the Cornwall Fire and Rescue service reported rescuing six people from flooding incidents on the roads which included rescues from flooded cars. On the 27th, the rain turned to snow across southwest England, leading to travel disruption including reports of abandoned vehicles around Dartmoor and further road disruption in mid-Wales as the area of precipitation moved north. Strong winds and locally intense rainfall on the 28th affected southern areas of Wales and England, resulting in several incidents of surface water flooding that led to the closure of several roads in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire to allow the floodwater to drain. The month closed with scattered heavy showers on the 29th, before the weather settled a little over the Easter weekend.

Weather diary \u2022 Low pressure dominating, wet and windy The weather pattern for March was characterized by a series of Atlantic low pressure systems crossing the country through the month with just a brief settled spell during the 2nd week and the occasional transient ridge of high pressure. Wet and windy was the order of the day on the 1st with a deep low crossing central England, producing significant rainfall across all regions, and some very strong winds for the south coast, gusts to 80mph being reported in places. Low pressure continued to dominate through to the 6th. By the 7th, high pressure had become established over Scandinavia and the UK fell under the influence of a continental easterly until the 11th. The consequence of that was northern parts of England and all of Scotland remained mostly dry but cold, and any weather systems were pushed south, bringing more wind and rain to southern and southwestern counties. However, by the 13th, the high pressure had all but vanished, allowing a mobile westerly airstream to resume over the UK with the latest system bringing heavy and persistent rain particularly to Northern Ireland, north Wales and northwest England. Parts of Snowdonia saw nearly 100mm of rain over a 24 hour period. From the 13th to the 25th, the UK was hit by a series of depressions, with their attendant fronts bringing more wind and rain across all regions. After the 20th, the trajectory of the lows changed to approach the UK from a more southerly direction. The resulting southwesterly winds finally brought some milder conditions, with maximum temperatures widely into the mid-teens Celsius, slightly higher over southern England. After the 25th and to the end of the month, a north-south split was evident with Scotland subject to a cold and showery northeasterly airstream, with the rest of the UK milder but very wet at times. Notes The Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884, and this report forms a continuation of that series. The purpose of each report is to provide an overview of the weather conditions across the UK for that month. The emphasis is mainly based on observations from the surface network of weather stations. Climate series based on from data from these stations are used to provide long term context. This summary was produced on 03/04/2024 14:28. The statistics are a provisional assessment of the observational data available at the time of production. Ongoing data receipt and quality assurance processes may result in subsequent updates to the statistics presented. If you have any questions or feedback about this product, spot any data errors or omissions, or wish to obtain further data, please contact the Met Office. For historical monthly weather reports please visit the Library and Archive. o The land-surface observations presented in this report are from the Met Office official weather station network which includes both automatic weather stations and manual climate stations operated by volunteer observers. Rainfall data are from the official registered rain-gauge network which includes rain-gauges operated by a number of key partners including the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and Northern Ireland Water. o The observations are carefully managed such that they conform to current best-practice observational standards as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The observations also pass through a range of quality assurance procedures at the Met Office before application for climate monitoring. o Daily and monthly maps, monthly statistics and monthly time-series are primarily based on the HadUK-Grid dataset of 1km resolution UK gridded climate data (Hollis et al, 2019). Monthly statistics from the monthly Central England temperature series 1659 (Manley, 1974) and England and Wales precipitation series from 1766 (Wigley et al, 1984) provide long term context. o The monthly lightning activity map is based on data from the Met Office ATDnet (Arrival Time Difference Network) system. This is an automatic lightning location network comprising around ten lightning outstation sensors located across Europe. o The monthly maps of mean sea level pressure and 250hPa wind speed and direction are based on the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al, 2019). ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades.

    "Document2": "Brazil \u2013 Extreme Rainfall Days in Metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo Have Risen Four-Fold\nStudy by researchers at Brazil\u2019s National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) reveals that etreme rainfall days in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have risen four-fold in seven decades. The research also shows a rise in the number of consecutive dry days, suggesting that extreme rainfall events are concentrated in shorter, more widely spaced periods.\nExtreme rainfall has become increasingly common in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The capital of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in the southern hemisphere. The metropolitan area suffered from flooding due to heavy rain in February. Early in the month, no less than 114 millimeters (mm) fell in a single 24-hour period. This was the second highest 24-hour amount for the month since 1943, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET).\nAccording to a study by researchers at the Natural Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN), an agency of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC), both the total rainfall and the frequency of extreme rainfall events in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have increased significantly in the last seven decades.\nWhile there were practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s, such days have occurred between twice and five times per year in the last ten years in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, according to the authors.\nThe study was supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation \u2013 FAPESP under the aegis of its Research Program on Global Climate Change (RPGCC). The findings are reported in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.\nResearchers affiliated with INMET, the National Space Research Institute (INPE) and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG-USP) also took part in the study.\n\u201cIntense rainstorms lasting a few hours with huge amounts of water, as much as 80 mm or 100 mm, are no longer sporadic events. They\u2019re happening more and more frequently,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo, a senior researcher at CEMADEN and principal investigator for the study, told.\nThe researchers analyzed data collected by INMET\u2019s weather stations at IAG-USP and Santana Lookout in the northern part of the city. The analysis showed an increase in the number of days with heavy rain and in the frequency of rainfall extremes, especially during the rainy season (spring-summer).\nThe dry season used to occur between April and September in most of the state but has lasted until October in recent decades. The number of consecutive days without any rain at all has also gradually increased, suggesting that heavy rainfall events are concentrated in fewer days, interrupted by longer periods of hot dry weather.\nWith fewer cold nights and more hot days, convective rainfall is more likely to occur, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall, the authors note.\nIn convective rainfall, the ground heats up, boosting evaporation and causing warm moist air to rise (convection). As the air ascends, it cools and forms convective clouds, which precipitate upon reaching saturation.\n\u201cWe observed a long-term trend in this kind of weather event, with very strong signs that climate change is in progress,\u201d Marengo said.\nRecords from the IAG-USP and Santana Lookout weather stations showed a four-fold increase in the number of days with rainfall exceeding 100 mm between 2000 and 2018 compared with those from the 1940s or 1960s.\nRecords from IAG-USP also showed an increase in total rainfall, in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, and in the frequency of consecutive dry days in the period 1931-2017.\n\u201cThis suggests that the increase in total rainfall in S\u00e3o Paulo in recent decades was due to an increase in \u2018heavy\u2019 precipitation, concentrated in fewer days and with longer dry spells in between,\u201d Marengo said.\nCauses\nAccording to the researchers, the changing rainfall regime in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo may be due to natural climate variability but may also be related to global warming and growing urbanization that has occurred especially in the last 40 years, which has exacerbated the occurrence of urban heat islands.\nThe growth of urbanization has transformed the region\u2019s previously exposed soil and Atlantic Rainforest remnants into sealed concrete, cement and asphalt surfaces that absorb heat while retaining no moisture. The temperature rises during the day, and as the sun goes down, the accumulated heat rises into the atmosphere, the relative humidity falls, and water evaporates rapidly from the ground to form towering cumulonimbus clouds, Marengo explained.\nIn his view, heat islands and similar effects help explain the increase in extreme rainfall events that occurred in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo between 1933 and 2010.\nIn the last 20 years, these changes in the rainfall regime, in conjunction with the high-risk construction of buildings on hillsides and riverbanks, have led to an increase in hydrometeorological hazards, triggering disasters such as flash floods, river flooding and landslides, the authors note.\n\u201cAn extreme rainfall event isn\u2019t itself a natural disaster. So-called natural disasters actually result from a combination of factors ranging from climate and weather to urban, economic and social phenomena. In other words, they\u2019re also anthropogenic disasters that result from human action, not just climate,\u201d Marengo said.\nMost Brazilian states suffer from flooding, but it is worst in S\u00e3o Paulo, which accounts for 33.36% of cases, followed by Santa Catarina (11.25%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.06%), Paran\u00e1 (8.33%), Rio de Janeiro (7.28%) and Minas Gerais (5.96%).\nSome 170 river floods and flash floods occurred in the period 2014-18. Flash floods produced the most deaths and serious injuries, followed by landslides and mudslides.\n\u201cThe Southeast and South regions of Brazil are the worst affected by hydrometeorological disasters because of their population density,\u201d Marengo said.\n\u201cLandslides, for example, only kill people because they\u2019re forced to live in high-risk areas where no one should build a home. The streets only fill up with water because the rivers have been channelized and buried, and the city\u2019s surfaces are sealed with asphalt and concrete.\u201d\nSource: Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\nRelated\nBrazil\nIndonesia \u2013 at Least 3 Dead, 2 Missing After Floods and Landslides in 3 Provinces\nUSA \u2013  Neptune Flood Insurance Now Available in 42 States\n\nECMWF\nLatest Articles\nFollow Us\nCategories\nFlood News in Americas by Country\nEditor's Picks\nDepave \u2013 the Community-Based Approach to Storm Water Management\nUsing Drones for Flood Disaster Risk Reduction, Assessment and Recovery\nFlood Protection Options for Airports\nReport \u2013 Flood Losses in Europe to Increase Fivefold by 2050\nUN \u2013 1995 to 2015, Flood Disasters Affected 2.3 Billion and Killed 157,000\nDrowning World \u2013 Photographer Gideon Mendel\u2019s 8 Year Project\nFlood and High Water Marks\nG-Cans Project, Tokyo \u2013 Japan\u2019s $2.6 Billion Flood Tunnel\nCookies | Privacy |  Contacts\nNorth America\nSouth America\nEurope\nAsia\nAfrica\nOceania\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 FloodList \n",
    "Summarized_Document1": "March 2024 Monthly Weather Report\n\nUK Overview\nMarch was unsettled, wet, and dull. The month began colder than normal, with notable low temperatures in southern areas (e.g., -4.6\u00b0C in Benson, Oxfordshire on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd in southwest England, causing travel disruptions. Milder weather followed, with temperatures reaching up to 18.8\u00b0C in Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th. The month ended with unsettled weather, including rain and wind. The provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was milder with a mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C, while Scotland had 5.0\u00b0C. The UK recorded 127% of the long-term average rainfall for March, with England and Wales exceeding 150% of their averages. County Down in Northern Ireland had its third wettest March on record with 145.9mm of rain. The UK recorded just 95.2 hours of sunshine, 87% of the long-term average.\n\nWeather Impacts\nSnow in Ireland, southwest Midlands, and Bristol caused traffic disruptions. Persistent rain, especially in southern England, led to groundwater and surface water flooding. Heavy snow on the 1st and 2nd caused traffic incidents and road closures.

The month started wet and windy, with significant rainfall and strong winds. High pressure over Scandinavia brought dry but cold conditions to northern England and Scotland from the 7th to the 11th. From the 13th to the 25th, a series of depressions brought more wind and rain. After the 25th, a north-south split was evident, with Scotland experiencing cold and showery weather, while the rest of the UK was milder but wet.\n\nNotes\nThe Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884.

    "Summarized_Document2": "A study by Brazil\u2019s National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) reveals that extreme rainfall days in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have increased four-fold over seven decades. The research indicates a rise in consecutive dry days, suggesting that extreme rainfall events are now concentrated in shorter, more widely spaced periods. In February, S\u00e3o Paulo experienced significant flooding, with 114 millimeters (mm) of rain falling in a single 24-hour period, the second highest for the month since 1943. The study, supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and reported in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, shows that days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) have increased from practically none in the 1950s to between two and five times per year in the last decade. Researchers from INMET, INPE, and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo also contributed to the study. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo, a senior researcher at CEMADEN, noted that intense rainstorms with 80 mm to 100 mm of rain are becoming more frequent. Data from INMET\u2019s weather stations at IAG-USP and Santana Lookout showed a four-fold increase in days with rainfall exceeding 100 mm between 2000 and 2018 compared to the 1940s or 1960s. The study also found an increase in total rainfall, the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, and consecutive dry days from 1931 to 2017. The researchers suggest that these changes may be due to natural climate variability, global warming, and urbanization, which has created urban heat islands. These changes, combined with high-risk construction on hillsides and riverbanks, have increased hydrometeorological hazards, leading to more flash floods, river flooding, and landslides. S\u00e3o Paulo accounts for 33.36% of flooding cases in Brazil, followed by Santa Catarina (11.25%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.06%), Paran\u00e1 (8.33%), Rio de Janeiro (7.28%), and Minas Gerais (5.96%). Between 2014 and 2018, 170 river floods and flash floods occurred, with flash floods causing the most deaths and injuries. The Southeast and South regions of Brazil are the worst affected by hydrometeorological disasters due to their population density.",

    "Document2": "The Maldives is racing to create new land. Why are so many people concerned?\nBy Jesse Chase-Lubitz\nPhotography by Neeta Satam for Nature\n24 April 2024\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSun, sand and sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those are the three ingredients for tourism in the Maldives, Mohamed Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father told him. For more than a decade, Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family owned a successful local hotel in Addu, the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 southernmost atoll. But nearly 9\u00a0months ago, the government took away the sea.\nA state-sponsored project had pulled up sediment from offshore areas and used it to extend the beach in front of the hotel by 130\u00a0metres\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 too far to walk for most tourists who want easy access to the ocean. Now all Shaiz sees from his hotel is a human-made desert and a slew of cancelled reservations.\nThe view in front of Mohamed Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel on Addu Atoll.\nThe Maldives is an 820-kilometre-long chain of nearly 1,200 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. The nation has become one of the most popular luxury tourism destinations in the world because of its Instagrammable beaches and its advertising slogan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe sunny side of life\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But the Maldives is also one of the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. With 80% of its land less than one metre above sea level, some scientists predict that the islands could be completely submerged by 2100.\nIn an effort to keep the country above water and thriving, the government is adopting a strategy used by many nations around the globe: land reclamation. The sandy stretch in front of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel is some of the newest land on the planet, dug up from the bottom of the ocean, sucked through pipes and piled along the coast to make more space.\nMaldivian government officials say that the land is necessary to make room for economic development, especially as sea levels rise.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will be a doorstep, a job destination and an income-generating destination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said President Mohamed Muizzu at the inauguration of a new land-reclamation project last December.\nCritics are unconvinced, and say that the country has enough space to thrive. One swathe of land on a neighbouring island near Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel was reclaimed in 2016. It remains undeveloped today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCall me in five years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shaiz says, gesturing to the newly created desert in front of his hotel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis land will be the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMohamed Shaiz and his family own a hotel on Addu Atoll.\nMohamed Shaiz and his family own a hotel on Addu Atoll.\nIn addition to the disputed economics, there is serious concern about the environmental damage that land reclamation can cause. Studies in the Maldives and at other sites around the world have shown that it can harm corals and seagrass, damage natural barriers, such as sand bars, mangroves and estuaries, and destroy marine habitats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAtolls are extremely vulnerable ecosystems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Bregje van Wesenbeeck, the scientific director of Deltares, a Dutch research institute for water management in Delft. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce you start to interfere with them, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sort of failing them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll.\nThe island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll.\nDutch planners are often considered the founders of land reclamation, with a history of water engineering going back some 800\u00a0years. Over the centuries, land-forming projects have shaped some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major cities, including Singapore, London, New York and Miami. In recent decades, most of the reclaimed land has been in East Asia. In China, Shanghai has reclaimed 350\u00a0square kilometres \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than three times the size of Paris\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 over the past few decades. Colombo has added 100\u00a0km2 in just 4\u00a0years, and 65\u00a0km2 of Mumbai is reclaimed. A study on twenty-first-century coastal-land reclamation found that of 135 large coastal cities with populations of more than one\u00a0million people, 75%\u00a0had reclaimed land1.\nWith projects stretching back to 1997, the Maldives is a veteran of large-scale land reclamation. Then-minister of state for environment Abdulla Naseer said in 2018 that there are an estimated 50\u00a0islands with reclaimed land in the country, although many specialists say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a conservative estimate.\nSource: Maldives Land and Survey Authority\nSource: Maldives Land and Survey Authority\nLand scarcity is a key factor driving reclamation projects. Although the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territory covers 90,000\u00a0km2, more than 99% of it is ocean. Around half a million people live on a total land area of just 300\u00a0km2, and the country welcomes around 1.3\u00a0million tourists each year, who contribute 80% of its gross domestic product. The capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9, is one of the most densely populated parts of the planet.

When the government decides to reclaim land, it takes sand from the lagoons using boats outfitted with suction pipes, which collect sand and coral debris from the ocean floor like giant vacuum cleaners. The boat then deposits the material in a different spot, either inside or outside the atoll, to form new land. Sometimes reclamation projects fill in the entire lagoon.\nHeaps of sand and debris are piled up next to Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel and behind the new patch of reclaimed land.\nHeaps of sand and debris are piled up next to Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel and behind the new patch of reclaimed land.\nAddu Atoll, the site of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, is about two hours south of Mal\u00c3\u00a9 by aeroplane. Its rich coral reefs support more than 1,200\u00a0species of fish\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the factors that led the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO to include the atoll in its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2020.\nSome of the islands are so narrow that you can almost always see water on both sides while standing in the centre. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a largely quiet and rural place that feels forgotten. Yet construction marches on.\nThe Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure announced the Addu Development Project in 2021, aiming to reclaim parts of the atoll and develop a road connection between existing islands. One of the ministry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s justifications is that it will provide extra housing. In the Maldives, land for houses is given away to eligible individuals and families. Addu City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, Ali Nizar, says that there have been more than 5,000\u00a0requests for housing since he entered office in 2021. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no other way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nA reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts.\nA reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts.\nBecause Addu has one of the few international airports in the country, the hope is also that the extra land will attract international investment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this huge expansion project, the transformational development of Addu City has commenced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said former president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih after inaugurating the project in June 2023.\nThe project has been controversial from the start. When it was announced, Ibrahim Mohamed was sitting at his desk at the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Mal\u00c3\u00a9. He instantly had concerns about how the project would affect Addu. Mohamed grew up in Addu in the 1970s, taking walks through the massive seagrass beds near his home. He remembers watching stingrays surf the waves, and marvelling at fiddler crabs along the shore.\nMohamed led the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for land-reclamation projects. When the Addu proposal landed on his desk, he contracted an environmental consulting group called Water Solutions, headquarted in Mal\u00c3\u00a9, to do the review.\nThe environmental impact report, published in February 2022, found that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe proposed reclamation is well received by the community\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh interest to implement the project based on the potential economic benefits\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But it also concluded that \u00e2\u0080\u009clong-term irreversible negative impacts will be generated from the project\u00e2\u0080\u009d for both the environment and the community, including by destroying coral reefs and seagrass meadows and harming the fishing and tourism industries.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was sufficient enough for the EPA to reject the project,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mohamed says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In May 2022, he quit his job after 10\u00a0years at the agency.\nAfter the report came out, the EPA pushed for changes, such as a smaller area from which the project would source sand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe tried to change the scope because we are here to protect the environment and at the same time, help development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director-general, Ibrahim Naeem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDevelopment has to go hand in hand with environment. It should not destroy the environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nOnce the changes were made to the proposed project, Water Solutions produced a second report to assess the environmental impacts at the end of September 2022. It found that the altered project, with increased mitigation and monitoring in place, would still have irreversible negative impacts\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 ranging from moderate to major\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 on marine plants and animals, protected and sensitive areas, tourism, fisheries and recreational activities.\nThe assessment calculated that the cost of the damage to coral reefs alone would be between US$340\u00a0million and $851\u00a0million.\nThe September 2022 report does not offer explicit recommendations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur role is to share the information. We just wanted to present the facts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Ahmed Jameel, managing director of Water Solutions and one of the authors of the report. However, he adds, the assessment was not vague in its conclusions. The findings showed clearly that the project \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould have an overall negative impact\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he says.\nWhen asked about the concerns raised in the second report, Naeem says that the findings, combined with insights he received from EPA staff members who conducted anonymous reviews of the EIA, indicated that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cenough justification in the report to approve it in terms of social benefit\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny development projects in this type of environment, especially in the marine area, will have an impact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you do reclamation properly, and if you do it wisely, I think impacts can be minimized\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nIbrahim Mohamed previously worked for the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency.\nIbrahim Mohamed previously worked for the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe construction company Van Oord is performing the reclamation work for the Addu Atoll project.\nThe construction company Van Oord is performing the reclamation work for the Addu Atoll project.\nThe Dutch company responsible for doing the construction on the project, Van Oord, told Nature that environmental management for the project is overseen by the EPA and that it is working with the agency and local specialists to minimize the environmental impacts. Van Oord said it prepared a comprehensive environmental management plan \u00e2\u0080\u009cbased on the mitigation measures mandated in the EIA and in compliance with international guidelines\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As part of its efforts, the company relocated coral and seagrass, and added silt screens to limit how much sediment would flow beyond the reclamation zone and affect other areas.\nVan Oord, which is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told Nature that \u00e2\u0080\u009call the predicted impacts have been effectively managed by implementing a series of mitigation measures\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nA new house on Hulhumeedhoo island, to the northeast of Addu City, remains unfinished and unoccupied.\nA new house on Hulhumeedhoo island, to the northeast of Addu City, remains unfinished and unoccupied.\nIn October 2022, the EPA approved the project. But critics say the environmental costs of the reclamation are too high.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think their efforts are not worth the amount of destruction and the irreversible damage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mohamed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can never be compensated properly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nToday, the land in front of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel is the result of that decision. Yet if you speak to people on Addu, many say that land is not what they need right now; they need jobs. Much of Addu is filled with empty, unfinished homes because individuals don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the income or resources to build houses on their free land.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty per cent [of our land] is abandoned or empty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Addu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former deputy mayor, Abdullah Thoyyib, who served the city before this reclamation project took place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need economic benefits and job opportunities, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nReefs at risk\nReclamation projects in the Maldives can fill the water with sediment, threatening coral reefs.\nReclamation projects in the Maldives can fill the water with sediment, threatening coral reefs.\nSitting in a resort in Addu City, Nisal Musthag places a map of Addu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main diving spots on the table. Musthag leads diving trips for one of the two active resorts in the atoll, and he has seen some of the damage that follows reclamation projects. He points at one of the four channels between the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagoon and the ocean. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is like a cemetery now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nMusthag does three to four dives a day, six days a week. Since the most-recent reclamation, there are at least five sites he no longer takes guests to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are people who come back every year to dive, and this year they were like, hey, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNisal Musthag leads diving trips in Addu, but has stopped taking tourists to spots where coral was damaged by reclamation projects.\nThe impacts of reclamation on coral health are one of researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 main concerns. Some reefs die when sediment is dumped on them to create new land. But even corals that escape direct damage can be harmed because the construction work creates clouds of sediment that spread out and settle on more distant reefs. Robbed of light and nutrients, these corals can struggle to survive. The damage to reefs not only harms the ecosystem but can also leave the islands vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise, say scientists.\nTo reduce damage to corals during the work at Addu, the EIA required that at least 10% of existing corals be relocated outside the reclamation footprints. Van Oord says it has moved 73,000\u00a0corals to 9\u00a0recipient sites identified in conjunction with the EPA. The firm says that it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly surpassed the EIA requirement\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nSaleem Rasheed is one of several local divers who helped to relocate the corals. He has been monitoring them for the past year. One species, blue coral (Heliopora coerulea), which was moved from the outside of the atoll to the inside, died completely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe moved 80\u00a0colonies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Rasheed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey survived one week and died entirely after six months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAli Nizar, Addu City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, supports the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reclamation projects.\nFathimath Saaira, social-justice advocate in Addu. \nFathimath Saaira, social-justice advocate in Addu. \nFathimath Saaira is a social-justice advocate in Addu who opposes the reclamation there.\nBut the rest of the species have shown resilience. Three months after relocation, they were struggling, but now, Rasheed says, they are alive and well.\nResearchers have found that coral relocation can work if colonies are moved to areas with similar conditions that are protected from waves. A 2017 study in Hawaii, for example, showed that relocated corals were thriving a decade after they were moved2. One study on coral restoration and relocation in the Maldives measured the survival rate of 242\u00a0coral fragments 12\u00a0months after they had been moved3. The authors found a 70% survival rate, which they concluded was a promising result. \nA solitary mangrove tree grows near newly reclaimed land in northeast Addu.\nA grey heron joins others on a new sea wall built in Addu.\nBut coral health is only one concern for researchers studying the effects of reclamation. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coastal ecosystems can also be in harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, say scientists.\nWater Solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 second report about the Addu project, for example, projected that the reclamation process would bury about 98\u00a0hectares of seagrass meadow in the atoll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagoon, at an estimated economic cost of more than $3.7\u00a0million a year.\nCoral debris makes up much of the reclaimed land.\nCoral debris makes up much of the reclaimed land.\nNot far from Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, a sea wall stretches towards the horizon, protecting a new swathe of land made of sand and coral debris. Coastal protection efforts such as the sea wall\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the changes wrought by reclamation\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 could have long-lasting effects on the processes that keep the islands from eroding, say researchers.\nLike other atolls, the Maldivian islands evolve with the seasons, with monsoons moving sand around them. Between December and February, the winds transport sand from the northeast to the southwest. Between June and August, the pattern reverses.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a natural island, you will see seasonally the sand shifting with the waves and the currents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mohamed. But reclamation can impede this process, he adds, by taking sand and coral debris from some locations through dredging\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 leaving a deficit in its wake\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and depositing it where natural flows wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Some projects add another complication by building hard barriers, such as sea walls, to protect the land, because they can stop the natural flow of sediments.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEcosystems can adapt if we allow them to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says van Wesenbeeck at Deltares. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy interfering, you will kill the whole system in the end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNot only does this change how the island naturally maintains itself, but it can also draw development to places that are at a high risk of a storm surge or erosion, say some researchers.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIslands can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t occur anywhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Virginie Duvat, a coastal geographer at La Rochelle University in France, who has studied the effects of land reclamation in the Maldives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you put an island where there was naturally no island, you create vulnerable land and you will necessarily have to build strong engineered structures, breakwaters and sea walls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says.\nA reclamation projection near Mal\u00c3\u00a9.\nThilafushi is an industrial island near Mal\u00c3\u00a9 that hosts one of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large rubbish dumps. New land is extending the island westward.\nIn a 2019 study4, Duvat and Alexandre Magnan, a geographer at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Sciences Po in Paris, assessed the scale of coastal changes that humans had made to 107 inhabited islands in the Maldives between 2004\u00e2\u0080\u009306 and 2014\u00e2\u0080\u009316. On almost half the islands, the researchers found significant degradation in the reefs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abilities to weaken waves and provide natural sources of sediments. One-fifth of the islands had almost entirely or entirely \u00e2\u0080\u009clost their natural capacity to respond and adjust to ocean climate-related pressures\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the researchers say.\nSource: Ref. 4\nSource: Ref. 4\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt means that a decision you have taken one day to rely on reclaimed land will necessarily cause you to invest more money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Duvat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are locked into the engineered path for decades and decades and potentially the rest of the century.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you build a levee, people will think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re safe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says van Wesenbeeck. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut is it wise to destroy environmental assets to create investment in an area that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the most vulnerable in the world for climate change?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe city of hope\nA new housing development in Hulhumal\u00c3\u00a9. \nA new housing development in Hulhumal\u00c3\u00a9. \nSome 550\u00a0km to the north of Addu, the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9, sits like an overpopulated postage stamp in the middle of the ocean.\nMal\u00c3\u00a9 is tiny\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 less than 2\u00a0km across at its widest point\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 but more than 200,000\u00a0people live on the island.

    "Summarized_Document2": "\u201cSun, sand and sea.\u201d Those are the three ingredients for tourism in the Maldives, Mohamed Shaiz\u2019s father told him. For more than a decade, Shaiz\u2019s family owned a successful local hotel in Addu, the Maldives\u2019 southernmost atoll. But nearly 9 months ago, the government took away the sea. A state-sponsored project had pulled up sediment from offshore areas and used it to extend the beach in front of the hotel by 130 metres \u2014 too far to walk for most tourists who want easy access to the ocean. Now all Shaiz sees from his hotel is a human-made desert and a slew of cancelled reservations. The Maldives is an 820-kilometre-long chain of nearly 1,200 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. The nation has become one of the most popular luxury tourism destinations in the world because of its Instagrammable beaches and its advertising slogan: \u201cthe sunny side of life\u201d. But the Maldives is also one of the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. With 80% of its land less than one metre above sea level, some scientists predict that the islands could be completely submerged by 2100. In an effort to keep the country above water and thriving, the government is adopting a strategy used by many nations around the globe: land reclamation. The sandy stretch in front of Shaiz\u2019s hotel is some of the newest land on the planet, dug up from the bottom of the ocean, sucked through pipes and piled along the coast to make more space. Maldivian government officials say that the land is necessary to make room for economic development, especially as sea levels rise. Critics are unconvinced, and say that the country has enough space to thrive. One swathe of land on a neighbouring island near Shaiz\u2019s hotel was reclaimed in 2016. It remains undeveloped today. In addition to the disputed economics, there is serious concern about the environmental damage that land reclamation can cause. Studies in the Maldives and at other sites around the world have shown that it can harm corals and seagrass, damage natural barriers, such as sand bars, mangroves and estuaries, and destroy marine habitats. The island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00e9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll. Dutch planners are often considered the founders of land reclamation, with a history of water engineering going back some 800 years. Over the centuries, land-forming projects have shaped some of the world\u2019s major cities, including Singapore, London, New York and Miami. In recent decades, most of the reclaimed land has been in East Asia. In China, Shanghai has reclaimed 350 square kilometres \u2014 more than three times the size of Paris \u2014 over the past few decades. Colombo has added 100 km2 in just 4 years, and 65 km2 of Mumbai is reclaimed. A study on twenty-first-century coastal-land reclamation found that of 135 large coastal cities with populations of more than one million people, 75% had reclaimed land. With projects stretching back to 1997, the Maldives is a veteran of large-scale land reclamation. Then-minister of state for environment Abdulla Naseer said in 2018 that there are an estimated 50 islands with reclaimed land in the country, although many specialists say that\u2019s a conservative estimate. Land scarcity is a key factor driving reclamation projects. Although the nation\u2019s territory covers 90,000 km2, more than 99% of it is ocean. Around half a million people live on a total land area of just 300 km2, and the country welcomes around 1.3 million tourists each year, who contribute 80% of its gross domestic product. The capital, Mal\u00e9, is one of the most densely populated parts of the planet. It\u2019s possible to walk across the entire island in 20 minutes. The Maldives\u2019 1,200 islands are all atolls \u2014 rings of coral reef that surround lagoons. When the government decides to reclaim land, it takes sand from the lagoons using boats outfitted with suction pipes, which collect sand and coral debris from the ocean floor like giant vacuum cleaners. The boat then deposits the material in a different spot, either inside or outside the atoll, to form new land. Sometimes reclamation projects fill in the entire lagoon. Addu Atoll, the site of Shaiz\u2019s hotel, is about two hours south of Mal\u00e9 by aeroplane. Its rich coral reefs support more than 1,200 species of fish \u2014 one of the factors that led the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO to include the atoll in its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2020. Some of the islands are so narrow that you can almost always see water on both sides while standing in the centre. It\u2019s a largely quiet and rural place that feels forgotten. Yet construction marches on. The Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure announced the Addu Development Project in 2021, aiming to reclaim parts of the atoll and develop a road connection between existing islands. One of the ministry\u2019s justifications is that it will provide extra housing. In the Maldives, land for houses is given away to eligible individuals and families. Addu City\u2019s mayor, Ali Nizar, says that there have been more than 5,000 requests for housing since he entered office in 2021. A reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts. Because Addu has one of the few international airports in the country, the hope is also that the extra land will attract international investment. The project has been controversial from the start. When it was announced, Ibrahim Mohamed was sitting at his desk at the Maldives\u2019 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Mal\u00e9. He instantly had concerns about how the project would affect Addu. Mohamed grew up in Addu in the 1970s, taking walks through the massive seagrass beds near his home. He remembers watching stingrays surf the waves, and marvelling at fiddler crabs along the shore. Mohamed led the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for land-reclamation projects. When the Addu proposal landed on his desk, he contracted an environmental consulting group called Water Solutions, headquarted in Mal\u00e9, to do the review. The environmental impact report, published in February 2022, found that \u201cthe proposed reclamation is well received by the community\u201d and that there was \u201chigh interest to implement the project based on the potential economic benefits\u201d. But it also concluded that \u201clong-term irreversible negative impacts will be generated from the project\u201d for both the environment and the community, including by destroying coral reefs and seagrass meadows and harming the fishing and tourism industries. \u201cIt was sufficient enough for the EPA to reject the project,\u201d Mohamed says. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t.\u201d In May 2022, he quit his job after 10 years at the agency. After the report came out, the EPA pushed for changes, such as a smaller area from which the project would source sand. \u201cWe tried to change the scope because we are here to protect the environment and at the same time, help development,\u201d says the agency\u2019s director-general, Ibrahim Naeem. \u201cDevelopment has to go hand in hand with environment. It should not destroy the environment,\u201d he says. Once the changes were made to the proposed project, Water Solutions produced a second report to assess the environmental impacts at the end of September 2022. It found that the altered project, with increased mitigation and monitoring in place, would still have irreversible negative impacts \u2014 ranging from moderate to major \u2014 on marine plants and animals, protected and sensitive areas, tourism, fisheries and recreational activities. The assessment calculated that the cost of the damage to coral reefs alone would be between US$340 million and $851 million. The September 2022 report does not offer explicit recommendations. \u201cOur role is to share the information. We just wanted to present the facts,\u201d says Ahmed Jameel, managing director of Water Solutions and one of the authors of the report. However, he adds, the assessment was not vague in its conclusions. The findings showed clearly that the project \u201cwould have an overall negative impact\u201d, he says. When asked about the concerns raised in the second report, Naeem says that the findings, combined with insights he received from EPA staff members who conducted anonymous reviews of the EIA, indicated that there was \u201cenough justification in the report to approve it in terms of social benefit\u201d. \u201cAny development projects in this type of environment, especially in the marine area, will have an impact,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cif you do reclamation properly, and if you do it wisely, I think impacts can be minimized\u201d. The Dutch company responsible for doing the construction on the project, Van Oord, told Nature that environmental management for the project is overseen by the EPA and that it is working with the agency and local specialists to minimize the environmental impacts. Van Oord said it prepared a comprehensive environmental management plan \u201cbased on the mitigation measures mandated in the EIA and in compliance with international guidelines\u201d. As part of its efforts, the company relocated coral and seagrass, and added silt screens to limit how much sediment would flow beyond the reclamation zone and affect other areas. Van Oord, which is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told Nature that \u201call the predicted impacts have been effectively managed by implementing a series of mitigation measures\u201d. In October 2022, the EPA approved the project. But critics say the environmental costs of the reclamation are too high. \u201cI think their efforts are not worth the amount of destruction and the irreversible damage,\u201d says Mohamed. \u201cIt can never be compensated properly.\u201d Today, the land in front of Shaiz\u2019s hotel is the result of that decision. Yet if you speak to people on Addu, many say that land is not what they need right now; they need jobs. Much of Addu is filled with empty, unfinished homes because individuals don\u2019t have the income or resources to build houses on their free land. \u201cFifty per cent [of our land] is abandoned or empty,\u201d says Addu\u2019s former deputy mayor, Abdullah Thoyyib, who served the city before this reclamation project took place. \u201cWe need economic benefits and job opportunities, but that\u2019s not happening.\u201d Sitting in a resort in Addu City, Nisal Musthag places a map of Addu\u2019s main diving spots on the table. Musthag leads diving trips for one of the two active resorts in the atoll, and he has seen some of the damage that follows reclamation projects. He points at one of the four channels between the island\u2019s lagoon and the ocean. \u201cThis is like a cemetery now,\u201d he says. Musthag does three to four dives a day, six days a week. Since the most-recent reclamation, there are at least five sites he no longer takes guests to. \u201cThere are people who come back every year to dive, and this year they were like, hey, what\u2019s happening?\u201d The impacts of reclamation on coral health are one of researchers\u2019 main concerns. Some reefs die when sediment is dumped on them to create new land. But even corals that escape direct damage can be harmed because the construction work creates clouds of sediment that spread out and settle on more distant reefs. Robbed of light and nutrients, these corals can struggle to survive. The damage to reefs not only harms the ecosystem but can also leave the islands vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise, say scientists. To reduce damage to corals during the work at Addu, the EIA required that at least 10% of existing corals be relocated outside the reclamation footprints. Van Oord says it has moved 73,000 corals to 9 recipient sites identified in conjunction with the EPA. The firm says that it \u201ccertainly surpassed the EIA requirement\u201d. Saleem Rasheed is one of several local divers who helped to relocate the corals. He has been monitoring them for the past year. One species, blue coral (Heliopora coerulea), which was moved from the outside of the atoll to the inside, died completely. \u201cWe moved 80 colonies,\u201d says Rasheed. \u201cThey survived one week and died entirely after six months.\u201d But the rest of the species have shown resilience. Three months after relocation, they were struggling, but now, Rasheed says, they are alive and well. Researchers have found that coral relocation can work if colonies are moved to areas with similar conditions that are protected from waves. A 2017 study in Hawaii, for example, showed that relocated corals were thriving a decade after they were moved. One study on coral restoration and relocation in the Maldives measured the survival rate of 242 coral fragments 12 months after they had been moved. The authors found a 70% survival rate, which they concluded was a promising result. But coral health is only one concern for researchers studying the effects of reclamation. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coastal ecosystems can also be in harm\u2019s way, say scientists. Water Solutions\u2019 second report about the Addu project, for example, projected that the reclamation process would bury about 98 hectares of seagrass meadow in the atoll\u2019s lagoon, at an estimated economic cost of more than $3.7 million a year. Not far from Shaiz\u2019s hotel, a sea wall stretches towards the horizon, protecting a new swathe of land made of sand and coral debris. Coastal protection efforts such as the sea wall \u2014 and the changes wrought by reclamation \u2014 could have long-lasting effects on the processes that keep the islands from eroding, say researchers. Like other atolls, the Maldivian islands evolve with the seasons, with monsoons moving sand around them. Between December and February, the winds transport sand from the northeast to the southwest. Between June and August, the pattern reverses. \u201cIn a natural island, you will see seasonally the sand shifting with the waves and the currents,\u201d says Mohamed. But reclamation can impede this process, he adds, by taking sand and coral debris from some locations through dredging \u2014 leaving a deficit in its wake \u2014 and depositing it where natural flows wouldn\u2019t. Some projects add another complication by building hard barriers, such as sea walls, to protect the land, because they can stop the natural flow of sediments. \u201cEcosystems can adapt if we allow them to,\u201d says van Wesenbeeck at Deltares. \u201cBy interfering, you will kill the whole system in the end.\u201d Not only does this change how the island naturally maintains itself, but it can also draw development to places that are at a high risk of a storm surge or erosion, say some researchers. \u201cIslands can\u2019t occur anywhere,\u201d says Virginie Duvat, a coastal geographer at La Rochelle University in France, who has studied the effects of land reclamation in the Maldives. \u201cIf you put an island where there was naturally no island, you create vulnerable land and you will necessarily have to build strong engineered structures, breakwaters and sea walls,\u201d she says. In a 2019 study, Duvat and Alexandre Magnan, a geographer at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations \u2014 Sciences Po in Paris, assessed the scale of coastal changes that humans had made to 107 inhabited islands in the Maldives between 2004\u201306 and 2014\u201316. On almost half the islands, the researchers found significant degradation in the reefs\u2019 abilities to weaken waves and provide natural sources of sediments. One-fifth of the islands had almost entirely or entirely \u201clost their natural capacity to respond and adjust to ocean climate-related pressures\u201d, the researchers say. \u201cIt means that a decision you have taken one day to rely on reclaimed land will necessarily cause you to invest more money,\u201d says Duvat. \u201cYou are locked into the engineered path for decades and decades and potentially the rest of the century.\u201d \u201cIf you build a levee, people will think they\u2019re safe,\u201d says van Wesenbeeck. \u201cBut is it wise to destroy environmental assets to create investment in an area that\u2019s one of the most vulnerable in the world for climate change?\u201d Some 550 km to the north of Addu, the capital, Mal\u00e9, sits like an overpopulated postage stamp in the middle of the ocean. Mal\u00e9 is tiny \u2014 less than 2 km across at its widest point \u2014 but more than 200,000 people live on the island. To relieve population pressures, the government decided in the late 1990s to start reclaiming a massive atoll next to Mal\u00e9, called Hulhumal\u00e9. Hulhumal\u00e9 has become known as \u2018the city of hope\u2019 \u2014 a place that not only has room but is also protected from sea-level rise. Architects designed it with sea-level-rise scenarios until 2100 in mind. The outer edges are 2 metres above sea level, more than twice the height of Mal\u00e9. Hulhulmal\u00e9 is regarded by specialists mainly as a worthwhile success for land reclamation, but critics have raised many questions about three newer projects on the western side of Mal\u00e9, all of which are being built using sand from the nearby lagoon. In 2021, Humay Abdulghafoor, a Mal\u00e9-based veteran fighter against land reclamation, sued three institutional bodies of the government on the grounds that they violated an environmental-protection law. She said that a new reclamation project risked causing serious environmental, economic and cultural damage to the local community by undermining \u201cthe economic and social benefits flowing from the natural environment and biodiversity richness of the Maldives\u201d, according to her legal case. The case has been ongoing for years, but on 14 February, it had its first breakthrough. The country\u2019s High Court decided to pause a dredging project near Mal\u00e9. However, the next day, the Supreme Court said that this pause would cause significant financial losses and overturned the decision. Mauroof Jameel, one of five architects chosen to build Hulhumal\u00e9, also has concerns about the latest projects. Jameel, who is based in Mal\u00e9, says that it made sense to reclaim land at Hulhumal\u00e9 to address congestion and help to build up the economy, but he is hesitant about how fast reclamation projects are now taking place. No one knows what the long-term impacts will be, he says. In many parts of the world, including the Maldives, land reclamation can be beneficial, say scientists. \u201cIn my opinion, it can be a positive thing around Mal\u00e9,\u201d says Duvat, because of population pressures there. But she doesn\u2019t see as much justification in more rural, distant atolls. \u201cIn this case, I cannot see the benefits.\u201d Officials with the Maldivian government acknowledge that land reclamation can cause harm. But there is no indication that the process is slowing down. Just 3 months after Muizzu was inaugurated as president last November, he announced the biggest reclamation project the nation has ever seen \u2014another endeavour to reclaim land near Mal\u00e9 on top of those already in the works. \u201cThe brand-new model city will revolutionize the country\u2019s urban landscape, addressing housing challenges in the greater Mal\u00e9 region by providing 65,000 housing units,\u201d he said in February at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. But many former officials urge caution. \u201cHow we create land, and the extent to which we do it, is excessive,\u201d says Mohamed Aslam, the minister of planning, housing and infrastructure for the previous administration, the agency responsible for land-reclamation projects. He says that land is often reclaimed as an easy way to keep the public happy, to show them that the government is doing something. \u201cThe easy part is building the land,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly after that does the hard part begin.\u201d",

But those among the estimated 20 million people living along Bangladesh's coast say the destruction comes in terrifying waves.\n\"It is closing in,\" said fisherman Aziz about the approaching sea. \"Where else can we escape?\"\n'Bodies can't endure this'\nThe threat is increasing.\nMost of the country's coastal areas are a meter or two above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, turning wells and lakes salty and killing crops on once fertile land.\n\"When the surge is higher, the seawater intrudes into our houses and land,\" said Ismail Howladar, a 65-year-old farmer growing chili peppers, sweet potatoes, sunflowers and rice.\n\"It brings only loss for us.\"\nCyclones -- which have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades -- are becoming more frequent as well as growing in intensity and duration due to the impact of climate change, scientists say.\nShahjalal Mia, a 63-year-old restaurant owner, said he watches the sea \"grasp more land\" each year.\n\"Many people have lost their homes to the sea already,\" he said. \"If there is no beach, there won't be any tourists.\"\nHe said he had experienced cyclones and searing heat waves grow worse, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).\n\"We are facing two, three, even four cyclones every year now,\" he said.\n\"And I can't measure temperatures in degrees but, simply put, our bodies can't endure this\".\n'Too late'\nBangladesh is among the countries ranked most vulnerable to disasters and climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\nIn April, the nation of around 170 million people experienced the hottest month, and the most sustained heat wave temperatures, in its history.\nLast month, a cyclone that killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes, was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting seen, the government's meteorological department said.\nBoth events were pinned on rising global temperatures.\nAinun Nishat, from Brac University in the capital Dhaka, said that the poorest were paying the price for carbon emissions from wealthier nations.\n\"We cannot do anything for Bangladesh if other nations, notably rich countries, do not do anything to fight emissions,\" he said.\nBangladesh is running out of time, Nishat added.\n\"It is becoming too late to prevent disasters,\" he said. \"We are unequipped to bring change.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \u00a9 2024 AFP\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nExplore further\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\n Feedback to editors\n15 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\nSep 22, 2024\n0\n7 hours ago\n8 hours ago\n9 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n13 hours ago\n13 hours ago\n13 hours ago\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\nSep 19, 2024\nSep 7, 2024\nSep 7, 2024\nAug 23, 2024\nAug 23, 2024\nAug 18, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore from Earth Sciences\n\nRelated Stories\nMay 28, 2024\nMay 1, 2024\nApr 29, 2024\nMay 27, 2024\nMay 26, 2024\nMay 28, 2024\nRecommended for you\n18 hours ago\n16 hours ago\nSep 21, 2024\nSep 21, 2024\nSep 20, 2024\nSep 20, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse this form if you have come across a typo, inaccuracy or would like to send an edit request for the content on this page.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general inquiries, please use our  contact form.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general feedback, use the public comments section below (please adhere to guidelines).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPlease select the most appropriate category to facilitate processing of your request\nThank you for taking time to provide your feedback to the editors.\nYour feedback is important to us.

    "Summarized_Document2": "After cyclone gales destroyed his home in 2007, Bangladeshi fisherman Abdul Aziz moved half a kilometer inland. A year later, the sea swallowed his old home. Now, 75-year-old Aziz fishes above his submerged former home and lives behind a low embankment. Government scientists report that rising seas driven by climate change are submerging Bangladesh's coast at one of the fastest global rates, potentially displacing at least a million people within a generation. Abdul Hamid, director general of the environment department, noted that Bangladesh experiences the effects of climate change intensely. A recent three-part study found that sea levels in Bangladesh are rising more than 60% higher than the global average. By 2050, over a million people may need to relocate due to local sea level rise, based on 25 years of satellite data from NASA and CNSA. Study lead A.K.M Saiful Islam attributed the above-average increases to melting ice caps, warming oceans, and river water from the monsoon. The study observed sea level rises of 4.2 to 5.8 millimeters annually along Bangladesh's coast, compared to the global average of 3.7 millimeters. This incremental rise has devastating effects on the estimated 20 million coastal residents. Most coastal areas are just one or two meters above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, salinizing wells and lakes and killing crops. Cyclones, which have killed hundreds of thousands in recent decades, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Shahjalal Mia, a restaurant owner, noted the worsening cyclones and heat waves, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. Bangladesh is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. In April, the country experienced its hottest month and most sustained heat wave. A recent cyclone killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes. Ainun Nishat from Brac University emphasized that the poorest are paying the price for emissions from wealthier nations. He warned that it is becoming too late to prevent disasters, and Bangladesh is unequipped to bring change.",

But those among the estimated 20 million people living along Bangladesh's coast say the destruction comes in terrifying waves.\n\"It is closing in,\" said fisherman Aziz about the approaching sea. \"Where else can we escape?\"\n'Bodies can't endure this'\nThe threat is increasing.\nMost of the country's coastal areas are a meter or two above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, turning wells and lakes salty and killing crops on once fertile land.\n\"When the surge is higher, the seawater intrudes into our houses and land,\" said Ismail Howladar, a 65-year-old farmer growing chili peppers, sweet potatoes, sunflowers and rice.\n\"It brings only loss for us.\"\nCyclones -- which have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades -- are becoming more frequent as well as growing in intensity and duration due to the impact of climate change, scientists say.\nShahjalal Mia, a 63-year-old restaurant owner, said he watches the sea \"grasp more land\" each year.\n\"Many people have lost their homes to the sea already,\" he said. \"If there is no beach, there won't be any tourists.\"\nHe said he had experienced cyclones and searing heat waves grow worse, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).\n\"We are facing two, three, even four cyclones every year now,\" he said.\n\"And I can't measure temperatures in degrees but, simply put, our bodies can't endure this\".\n'Too late'\nBangladesh is among the countries ranked most vulnerable to disasters and climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\nIn April, the nation of around 170 million people experienced the hottest month, and the most sustained heat wave temperatures, in its history.\nLast month, a cyclone that killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes, was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting seen, the government's meteorological department said.\nBoth events were pinned on rising global temperatures.\nAinun Nishat, from Brac University in the capital Dhaka, said that the poorest were paying the price for carbon emissions from wealthier nations.\n\"We cannot do anything for Bangladesh if other nations, notably rich countries, do not do anything to fight emissions,\" he said.\nBangladesh is running out of time, Nishat added.\n\"It is becoming too late to prevent disasters,\" he said. \"We are unequipped to bring change.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \u00a9 2024 AFP\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nExplore further\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\n Feedback to editors\n15 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\nSep 22, 2024\n0\n7 hours ago\n8 hours ago\n9 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n13 hours ago\n13 hours ago\n13 hours ago\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\nSep 19, 2024\nSep 7, 2024\nSep 7, 2024\nAug 23, 2024\nAug 23, 2024\nAug 18, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore from Earth Sciences\n\nRelated Stories\nMay 28, 2024\nMay 1, 2024\nApr 29, 2024\nMay 27, 2024\nMay 26, 2024\nMay 28, 2024\nRecommended for you\n18 hours ago\n16 hours ago\nSep 21, 2024\nSep 21, 2024\nSep 20, 2024\nSep 20, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse this form if you have come across a typo, inaccuracy or would like to send an edit request for the content on this page.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general inquiries, please use our  contact form.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general feedback, use the public comments section below (please adhere to guidelines).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPlease select the most appropriate category to facilitate processing of your request\nThank you for taking time to provide your feedback to the editors.\nYour feedback is important to us.

    "Summarized_Document2": "After cyclone gales destroyed his home in 2007, Bangladeshi fisherman Abdul Aziz moved half a kilometer inland. A year later, the sea swallowed his old home. Now, 75-year-old Aziz fishes above his submerged former home and lives behind a low embankment. Government scientists report that rising seas driven by climate change are submerging Bangladesh's coast at one of the fastest global rates, potentially displacing at least a million people within a generation. Abdul Hamid, director general of the environment department, noted that Bangladesh experiences the effects of climate change intensely. A recent three-part study found that sea levels in Bangladesh are rising more than 60% higher than the global average. By 2050, over a million people may need to relocate due to local sea level rise, based on 25 years of satellite data from NASA and CNSA. Study lead A.K.M Saiful Islam attributed the above-average increases to melting ice caps, warming oceans, and river water from the monsoon. The study observed sea level rises of 4.2 to 5.8 millimeters annually along Bangladesh's coast, compared to the global average of 3.7 millimeters. This incremental rise has devastating effects on the estimated 20 million coastal residents. Most coastal areas are just one or two meters above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, salinizing wells and lakes and killing crops. Cyclones, which have killed hundreds of thousands in recent decades, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Shahjalal Mia, a restaurant owner, noted the worsening cyclones and heat waves, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. Bangladesh is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. In April, the country experienced its hottest month and most sustained heat wave. A recent cyclone killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes. Ainun Nishat from Brac University emphasized that the poorest are paying the price for emissions from wealthier nations. He warned that it is becoming too late to prevent disasters, and Bangladesh is unequipped to bring change.",

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

Additionally, the bulletin also includes highlights regarding the boreal summer (June-July-August). Most of the reported findings are based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature highlights:\u00a0\n  \n\nGlobal Temperatures\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally (together with August 2023), with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August.\u202f\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was 1.51\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level and is the 13th month in a 14-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. *\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record for any 12-month period, at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. These values are identical to those recorded for the previous two 12-month periods, ending in June and July 2024.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.23\u00b0C warmer than the same period in 2023. The average anomaly for the remaining months of this year would need to drop by at least 0.30\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. This has never happened in the entire ERA5 dataset, making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record.\u00a0\n*Datasets other than ERA5 may not confirm the 13 months above 1.5\u00b0C highlighted here, due to the relatively small margins above 1.5\u00b0C of ERA5 global temperatures for July and August 2023 and May, June, and August 2024 and differences among the various datasets.\u00a0\nEurope and other regions\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for August 2024 was 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August, making the month the second warmest August on record for Europe after August 2022, which was 1.73\u00b0C above average.\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean temperatures were most above average over southern and eastern Europe, but below average over northwestern parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway.\u00a0\u00a0\nOutside Europe, temperatures were most above average over eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\nTemperatures were below average over far eastern Russia and Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan and the Sahel.\u00a0\nSea surface temperature\u00a0\nThe average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest value on record for the month, and only 0.07\u00b0C below August 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe equatorial Pacific had below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs across the oceans remained unusually high over many regions.\u00a0\nAccording to Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): \"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0\nMonthly year-to-date global surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for the ten warmest years on record. 2024 is shown with a red line, 2023 with a yellow line, and all other years with grey lines. Each data point shows the average anomaly from January to the corresponding month. E.g. the value for August 2024 corresponds to the average anomaly from January to August 2024. Data source: ERA5.

Note that ERA5 SSTs are estimates of the ocean temperature at about 10m depth (known as foundation temperature). The results may differ from other SST products providing temperature estimates at different depths, such as 20cm depth for NOAA\u2019s OISST.\u00a0\nSea ice maps and data are from a combination of information from ERA5, as well as from the EUMETSAT OSI SAF Sea Ice Index v2.2.\u00a0\nRegional area averages quoted here are the following longitude/latitude bounds:\u00a0\nGlobe, 180W-180E, 90S-90N, over land and ocean surfaces.\u00a0\nEurope, 25W-40E, 34N-72N, over land surfaces only.\u00a0\u00a0\nAbout the Data and Analysis\nInformation on national records and impacts:\u00a0\nInformation on national records and impacts are based on national and regional reports. For details see the respective temperature and hydrological C3S climate bulletin for the month.\u00a0\nC3S has followed the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to use the most recent 30-year period for calculating climatological averages and changed to the reference period of 1991-2020 for its C3S Climate Bulletins covering January 2021 onward.

It delivers freely accessible operational data and services providing users with reliable and up-to-date information related to our planet and its environment. The programme is coordinated and managed by the European Commission and implemented in partnership with the Member States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), EU Agencies and Mercator Oc\u00e9an, amongst others.\u202f\u00a0\nECMWF operates two services from the EU\u2019s Copernicus Earth observation programme: the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). They also contribute to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), which is implemented by the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC). The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by 35 states. It is both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing and disseminating numerical weather predictions to its Member States. This data is fully available to the national meteorological services in the Member States. The supercomputer facility (and associated data archive) at ECMWF is one of the largest of its type in Europe and Member States can use 25% of its capacity for their own purposes.\u202f\u00a0\nECMWF has expanded its location across its Member States for some activities.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission, reports that August 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally, with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. This month was 1.51\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, marking the 13th month in a 14-month period where global temperatures exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. The year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, the highest on record for this period.In Europe, August 2024 was the second warmest on record, with temperatures 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Southern and eastern Europe experienced the highest anomalies, while northwestern parts of Ireland, the UK, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway were below average. Globally, temperatures were most above average in eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia, and below average in far eastern Russia, Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan, and the Sahel.The average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest on record for the month. The equatorial Pacific showed below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs remained unusually high in many regions.Hydrologically, August 2024 was drier than average over most of continental Europe, including southern UK and Ireland, the Alps, the Balkans, northwest Russia, and eastern Fennoscandia, with droughts and wildfires in the south and east. Conversely, Iceland, northern UK and Ireland, much of Fennoscandia, the northern seaboard of continental Europe, and western Russia and T\u00fcrkiye experienced above-average precipitation, leading to floods and damage in some areas. Outside Europe, eastern North America, central Russia, eastern China, and eastern Australia were wetter than average, while Mexico, southern North America, regions of Russia, China, most of South America, and Southern Africa were drier than average, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia, and Brazil.The global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C). The average temperature for European land for summer 2024 was the highest on record at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Summer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe, while most of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe experienced drier-than-average conditions, sometimes associated with drought.The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides detailed monthly climate bulletins based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations worldwide. The service is part of the EU's Copernicus Earth observation programme, which aims to provide reliable and up-to-date information about the planet and its environment.",

Additionally, the bulletin also includes highlights regarding the boreal summer (June-July-August). Most of the reported findings are based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature highlights:\u00a0\n  \n\nGlobal Temperatures\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally (together with August 2023), with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August.\u202f\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was 1.51\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level and is the 13th month in a 14-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. *\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record for any 12-month period, at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. These values are identical to those recorded for the previous two 12-month periods, ending in June and July 2024.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.23\u00b0C warmer than the same period in 2023. The average anomaly for the remaining months of this year would need to drop by at least 0.30\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. This has never happened in the entire ERA5 dataset, making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record.\u00a0\n*Datasets other than ERA5 may not confirm the 13 months above 1.5\u00b0C highlighted here, due to the relatively small margins above 1.5\u00b0C of ERA5 global temperatures for July and August 2023 and May, June, and August 2024 and differences among the various datasets.\u00a0\nEurope and other regions\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for August 2024 was 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August, making the month the second warmest August on record for Europe after August 2022, which was 1.73\u00b0C above average.\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean temperatures were most above average over southern and eastern Europe, but below average over northwestern parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway.\u00a0\u00a0\nOutside Europe, temperatures were most above average over eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\nTemperatures were below average over far eastern Russia and Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan and the Sahel.\u00a0\nSea surface temperature\u00a0\nThe average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest value on record for the month, and only 0.07\u00b0C below August 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe equatorial Pacific had below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs across the oceans remained unusually high over many regions.\u00a0\nAccording to Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): \"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0\nMonthly year-to-date global surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for the ten warmest years on record. 2024 is shown with a red line, 2023 with a yellow line, and all other years with grey lines. Each data point shows the average anomaly from January to the corresponding month. E.g. the value for August 2024 corresponds to the average anomaly from January to August 2024. Data source: ERA5.

The year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, the highest on record for this period.In Europe, August 2024 was the second warmest on record, with temperatures 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Southern and eastern Europe experienced the highest anomalies, while northwestern parts of Ireland, the UK, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway were below average. Globally, temperatures were most above average in eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia, and below average in far eastern Russia, Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan, and the Sahel.The average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest on record for the month. The equatorial Pacific showed below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs remained unusually high in many regions.Hydrologically, August 2024 was drier than average over most of continental Europe, including southern UK and Ireland, the Alps, the Balkans, northwest Russia, and eastern Fennoscandia, with droughts and wildfires in the south and east. Conversely, Iceland, northern UK and Ireland, much of Fennoscandia, the northern seaboard of continental Europe, and western Russia and T\u00fcrkiye experienced above-average precipitation, leading to floods and damage in some areas. Outside Europe, eastern North America, central Russia, eastern China, and eastern Australia were wetter than average, while Mexico, southern North America, regions of Russia, China, most of South America, and Southern Africa were drier than average, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia, and Brazil.The global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C). The average temperature for European land for summer 2024 was the highest on record at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Summer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe, while most of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe experienced drier-than-average conditions, sometimes associated with drought.The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides detailed monthly climate bulletins based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations worldwide.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

    "Document2": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

    "Summarized_Document2": "The Etsy marketplace, founded in 2005, connects buyers with makers, artists, designers, and crafters selling unique handmade, originally designed, or specially-selected vintage items. However, as the seller community grew and inventory expanded globally, the marketplace became cluttered with goods that didn't meet Etsy's handmade criteria. In response, Etsy is doubling down on its founding mission to 'keep commerce human,' as stated by CEO Josh Silverman. In the first quarter of 2024, Etsy reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sales (GMS) from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Fiscal 2023 also saw a 2% drop in GMS from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, despite an increase in active sellers from 5.4 million to 7 million and a 3% rise in active buyers to 92 million. On a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023. The loss in 2022 was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge related to the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. Etsy ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting 225 employees. Silverman acknowledged the challenging macro and competitive environment, noting that GMS has remained flat since 2021. To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

    "Document2": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2.

In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

    "Summarized_Document2": "The Etsy marketplace, founded in 2005, connects buyers with makers, artists, designers, and crafters selling unique handmade, originally designed, or specially-selected vintage items. However, as the seller community grew and inventory expanded globally, the marketplace became cluttered with goods that didn't meet Etsy's handmade criteria. In response, Etsy is doubling down on its founding mission to 'keep commerce human,' as stated by CEO Josh Silverman. In the first quarter of 2024, Etsy reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sales (GMS) from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Fiscal 2023 also saw a 2% drop in GMS from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, despite an increase in active sellers from 5.4 million to 7 million and a 3% rise in active buyers to 92 million. On a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023. The loss in 2022 was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge related to the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. Etsy ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting 225 employees. Silverman acknowledged the challenging macro and competitive environment, noting that GMS has remained flat since 2021. To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

    "Document2": "Alibaba Marketing Strategy 2024: A Case Study\nAlibaba, the leading e-commerce company in China, has revolutionized the industry with its cutting-edge marketing strategy. By focusing on customer acquisition, market segmentation, and brand positioning, Alibaba has established a dominant presence in the e-commerce landscape. With its comprehensive approach, the company excels in both the B2B and B2C markets, catering to businesses of all sizes and individual consumers.\nOne of the key factors behind Alibaba\u2019s success is its digital marketing solutions, which include SEO, online advertising, and social media marketing. By leveraging these tools, Alibaba drives brand promotion and boosts sales, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of the industry. The company\u2019s commitment to customer acquisition and market segmentation has solidified its position as a leader in the e-commerce space.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have enabled it to compete with international e-commerce giants. With a network that reaches over 150 countries in the global logistics industry, Alibaba has formed partnerships with companies in retail, logistics, and technology sectors to reach more consumers and offer a wider range of products and services.\nFurthermore, Alibaba\u2019s brand positioning efforts through online advertising have helped it become a trusted and reliable partner for businesses and consumers. The company\u2019s innovative tactics, such as the annual November 11 sale, have played a significant role in generating record-breaking revenues. In fact, Alibaba earned $14.3 billion (\u20ac13.45 billion) revenue in just 24 hours, making it the highest revenue gained in one shopping day worldwide.\nUnder the visionary leadership of CEO Daniel Zhang, Alibaba continues to thrive. With over 24,000 employees in 70 offices worldwide, the company remains committed to its mission of reaching over 500 million consumers in 200 countries.\nKey Takeaways:\nAlibaba\u2019s Dominance in E-commerce\nWhen it comes to e-commerce, Alibaba is a force to be reckoned with. This multinational conglomerate has carved out a dominant position in both the B2B and B2C markets, solidifying its e-commerce dominance in China and beyond.\nAlibaba\u2019s success can be attributed to its customer-centric approach, placing the needs of users at the heart of its strategy. By creating a user-friendly platform, Alibaba has been able to attract and retain a large user base, offering them a seamless shopping experience.\nIn 2014, Alibaba went public with a staggering 83% market share in China\u2019s e-commerce market. Since then, the landscape has changed with the rise of competitors like Pinduoduo and JD.com. However, Alibaba has managed to maintain a significant market share, currently standing at 39.5%. While its market share has decreased, it is still a force to be reckoned with.\nAlibaba\u2019s continuous growth is fueled by its strong performance in the B2B and B2C sectors. One of its key strengths is its well-integrated supply chain, which allows for efficient operations and reduced costs. Moreover, Alibaba\u2019s Chinese e-commerce unit, Taobao & Tmall Group, experienced a 4% growth in revenue during the fourth quarter, demonstrating its resilience in a competitive market.\nTo enhance user experience and stay ahead of the competition, Alibaba focuses on improved product discovery tools and personalized recommendations. This customer-centric approach ensures that users find exactly what they\u2019re looking for, keeping them engaged and satisfied.\nMarket Share Comparison\nExamining the market share landscape, we can see that while Alibaba\u2019s share has decreased, it still maintains a significant lead over its competitors. Pinduoduo has witnessed substantial growth, increasing its market share from 11% to 16% in 2021. Meanwhile, JD.com has remained stable within the range of 16-18%.\nAs Alibaba continues to navigate the ever-changing e-commerce landscape, it faces competition not only from domestic players but also from global giants like Temu and SHEIN. However, Alibaba\u2019s strong brand positioning and global expansion efforts, including its focus on the US market, give it a competitive edge.\nAll in all, Alibaba\u2019s dominance in e-commerce is a result of its customer-centric approach, user-friendly platform, and continuous efforts to enhance the overall shopping experience. With its unwavering focus on innovation and global expansion, Alibaba is set to maintain its position as a leader in the e-commerce industry.\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAs Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce arm, AliExpress, operates in 150 countries, the company has been successful in its global expansion efforts. By forging strategic partnerships and making strategic investments, Alibaba has extended its reach beyond China, aiming to capture new markets and compete with major players like Amazon.\nOne key strategy Alibaba employs in its global expansion is forming strategic partnerships with established brands and companies. For instance, Tmall Luxury Pavilion, launched in 2017, has attracted 80 luxury brands, including Burberry and Versace, to sell their products directly to Chinese consumers. This strategic partnership has allowed Alibaba to tap into the luxury market and cater to the increasing demand for high-end goods in China.\nAnother important aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is its focus on connecting small and medium-sized brands from around the world with Alibaba customers in China. Through Taobao Global, Alibaba partners with these brands, providing them with access to a massive consumer base in China, while also bringing a diverse range of products to Chinese consumers.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not limited to China or Asia. The company has made significant investments in online marketplaces in Southeast Asia, such as Lazada, where Alibaba invested $4 billion. This investment has allowed Alibaba to gain a strong foothold in the Southeast Asian market and expand its global reach.\nAdditionally, Alibaba has acquired e-commerce sites like Daraz in South Asia, made investments in companies like Tokopedia in Indonesia and Paytm in India, and partnered with MegaFon and Russia\u2019s Mail.Ru Group to establish AliExpress Russia. These moves highlight Alibaba\u2019s commitment to expanding its presence in key markets and capitalizing on the growth opportunities they offer.\nCompetitive analysis also plays a crucial role in Alibaba\u2019s global expansion strategy. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of its competitors, such as Amazon and eBay, Alibaba can identify areas for improvement and innovation. This competitive analysis allows Alibaba to stay ahead in the global e-commerce landscape and navigate the challenges posed by regional competitors.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles related to foreign investments, e-commerce, and data privacy pose obstacles that Alibaba must navigate and overcome. Furthermore, competition from global players like Amazon and regional competitors requires Alibaba to invest significantly in customer support and innovation.\nAnother crucial aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is adapting its strategies to local markets and consumer preferences. Navigating cultural differences is vital for Alibaba to succeed in new markets and ensure its strategies resonate with local consumers.\nIn summary, Alibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have been driven by strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and investments in key markets. With its presence in 150 countries, Alibaba is successfully competing with major players in the e-commerce industry. By conducting comprehensive competitive analysis and adapting to local markets, Alibaba continues to expand its global footprint and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce.\nAlibaba\u2019s Brand Positioning\nAlibaba, a global leader in e-commerce, has strategically positioned itself as a trusted and reliable brand through innovative online advertising campaigns.

With a commitment to innovation, Alibaba continually enhances its platform to provide an unparalleled user experience.\nThe company\u2019s brand positioning is further reinforced by its strong emphasis on trust and credibility. Alibaba\u2019s secure payment options and stringent quality control measures contribute to its reputation as a reliable partner.\nFounder Jack Ma\u2019s significant recognition and popularity have also played a crucial role in building Alibaba\u2019s brand image. His entrepreneurial journey and success have made him a household name, further enhancing the company\u2019s credibility.\nAlibaba\u2019s brand positioning has enabled it to surpass retail giants like Walmart in global sales and achieve the world\u2019s biggest IPO in 2014. Today, the company holds a place within the global top 10 market cap.\nTo support its brand positioning, Alibaba has expanded its operations into major global markets, allowing it to reach a larger customer base. The company\u2019s presence in nearly 240 countries worldwide is a testament to its global dominance.\nTo visually represent Alibaba\u2019s brand positioning, the image below showcases the company\u2019s logo, embodying trust, innovation, and credibility:\nIn conclusion, Alibaba has successfully positioned itself as a trusted and innovative brand through strategic online advertising campaigns.

By introducing interactive games, challenges, and rewards, Alibaba enhances customer participation and ensures a memorable shopping experience.\nAlibaba\u2019s commitment to innovation is further exemplified by their integration of augmented reality (AR) into the customer experience. Through the use of AR technology, Alibaba enhances the shopping experience by providing interactive games and apps that allow customers to engage with products in a unique way.\nFurthermore, Alibaba leverages influencer marketing on popular platforms like WeChat and Weibo to reach a wider audience.

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Expressed in US millions)\n\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), Shopify uses certain non-GAAP and other financial measures to provide additional information in order to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

    "Document1": "Ebay Marketing Strategy 2024: A Case Study\nIn recent years, eBay has implemented a comprehensive marketing strategy to drive its success and maintain its position as a leading online marketplace. With a strong focus on customer experience, innovative partnerships, and global expansion, eBay has seen impressive revenue growth and user engagement. In this case study, we will delve into eBay\u2019s marketing approach and examine the key strategies that have contributed to its continued success.\nKey Takeaways:\nWith its impressive financial performance, eBay\u2019s marketing strategy serves as a testament to its ability to adapt and thrive in the ever-evolving e-commerce landscape. In the following sections, we will explore the various facets of eBay\u2019s marketing approach, providing insights and key learnings for businesses looking to enhance their own strategies.\nExamining eBay\u2019s Revenue Model\neBay, one of the world\u2019s leading online marketplaces, operates on a revenue model that incorporates various sources of income. By understanding how eBay generates revenue, we can gain valuable insights into its business strategy and success.\nAt the core of eBay\u2019s revenue model are listing fees and commissions on sales. For every listing, eBay charges a fee of $0.35, following a free limit of 200 products. This scalable approach enables sellers to list their products while generating revenue for the platform. Additionally, eBay earns a commission on sales through a Final Value Fee, which is a percentage of the final sale price, and an additional charge of $0.30 per order.\nAside from listing fees and commissions, eBay also generates revenue through advertising. Sellers have the option to pay advertising fees to promote their products on the platform, providing them with increased visibility and sales opportunities. This advertising revenue stream further supports eBay\u2019s commitment to creating a thriving marketplace for its sellers.\nOver the years, eBay has expanded its revenue streams through strategic acquisitions. Notable acquisitions such as PayPal, Rent.com, Skype, and StubHub have not only diversified eBay\u2019s revenue but also strengthened its position in the market. These acquisitions have allowed eBay to tap into new markets and revenue sources, further fueling its growth and success.\nWith over 19 million sellers worldwide and more than 1 billion active listings, eBay\u2019s revenue model has proven to be highly effective. It has established itself as the world\u2019s second most visited online marketplace, with over 182 million active users globally. eBay\u2019s revenue model, combined with its wide reach and diverse product offerings, has contributed to its impressive financial performance.\nTake a look at the table below for a snapshot of eBay\u2019s revenue statistics:\nWith its successful revenue model and ongoing innovations, eBay continues to solidify its position in the e-commerce industry. The platform\u2019s dedication to providing sellers with a profitable marketplace and buyers with a wide range of products ensures sustainable growth and long-term success.\neBay\u2019s Marketing Approach \u2013 Beyond Online Car Boot Sales\neBay, initially known as AuctionWatch, revolutionized the e-commerce industry when it was founded in 1995 by computer programmer Pierre Omidyar. What started as a platform for online auctions has evolved into much more. Omidyar\u2019s vision extended beyond a simple auction site; he aimed to create an online community that fostered democratic decision-making, decentralized operations, and open communication.\nDespite its success, eBay has faced challenges in recent years. To overcome the perception of being just an \u201conline car boot sale,\u201d the company has shifted its marketing approach. One significant strategy is investing in traditional media advertising, particularly television. eBay recognizes that traditional media is still a powerful channel for brand building and reshaping consumer perceptions.\nThe decision to invest in traditional media advertising aligns with eBay\u2019s goal of reasserting its unique selling position as the site where buyers and sellers can find anything. By utilizing television ads, eBay has the opportunity to reach a wider audience and showcase the diverse range of products available on the platform.\nAlthough digital marketing platforms have gained prominence, traditional media advertising provides eBay with an advantage. While digital ads can be effective in targeting specific audiences, traditional media appeals to a broader demographic. This broader reach allows eBay to engage with potential buyers and sellers who may not be as active online.\nFurthermore, traditional media advertisements can have a lasting impact on brand recall and recognition. Television commercials, in particular, enable eBay to convey its message visually and emotionally, creating a memorable connection with the audience.\nBy diversifying its marketing approach beyond online advertising, eBay aims to broaden its appeal and attract new users. Additionally, by leveraging traditional media, eBay can address the perception that it is inconvenient compared to more streamlined platforms like Amazon and Facebook.\nDespite the challenges eBay faces, its commitment to brand building through traditional media demonstrates its determination to remain a dominant player in the e-commerce industry. Through television advertisements and other traditional media channels, eBay is actively reshaping consumer perceptions and reviving its brand.\n\nImage alt tag: eBay marketing approach\nLeveraging Social Media for Promotion\nSocial media has become an integral part of people\u2019s lives, offering a powerful platform for businesses to promote their products and services. Recognizing the immense potential of social media, eBay has implemented a program to incentivize sellers to leverage social media platforms for promotion.\nThe eBay social media promotion program provides sellers with the opportunity to reduce their fees for successful sales generated through social links. By actively promoting their listings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, sellers can reach a broader audience and increase their chances of making sales.\nWith 98% of digital consumers being active on social media and 74% of people trusting social media when making purchasing decisions, it is evident that social sharing plays a significant role in driving sales and brand visibility. By encouraging sellers to utilize social media as a promotional tool, eBay aims to enhance the visibility of listings and attract potential buyers.\nThis initiative has proven to be successful, with a notable increase in sales resulting from social media promotion. As a result, eBay plans to expand this program to other markets worldwide, allowing sellers from different regions to benefit from this incentivized social sharing approach.\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s collaboration with influencers on platforms like Instagram has also contributed to increased visibility and sales. With over a billion monthly active users on Instagram and influencer posts generating an average engagement rate of 3.21%, leveraging the reach and influence of social media influencers has become an effective marketing strategy.\n\nSocial Media: A Game Changer for eBay\nSocial media has transformed the way businesses promote and sell their products, and eBay is leveraging this trend to enhance its visibility and drive sales. By incentivizing sellers to promote their listings on social media platforms, eBay is tapping into a vast audience and creating new opportunities for sellers to succeed.\nCollaborations and Influencer Marketing\neBay recognizes the immense power of influencer marketing and the impact it can have on driving brand awareness and increasing product visibility. In an effort to tap into this growing trend, eBay has ventured into exciting collaborations, including a groundbreaking partnership with the hit reality TV show Love Island.\nLove Island, with its massive viewership of 3.2 million during the live final in 2021, offers a great opportunity for eBay to reach a wide audience and promote their commitment to sustainability in the fashion industry. As a new sponsor of Love Island, eBay has taken on the responsibility of replacing fast fashion brands with a focus on second-hand clothing and encouraging viewers to embrace pre-loved fashion.\nThis collaboration enables eBay to leverage the influence of Love Island contestants and popular influencers to advocate for sustainable fashion choices. By working with influencers and bloggers, eBay can enhance its brand awareness and credibility, as well as drive traffic and conversions to their platform.\nThrough collaborations with influencers, eBay can tap into their loyal following on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. By partnering with these individuals, eBay can harness their influence to establish long-term relationships with their target audience, as well as foster trust and credibility.\nProduct reviews, giveaways, and content collaborations are some of the key strategies used in influencer marketing. Influencers not only provide valuable reviews of eBay products, but they also promote specific actions from their audience, such as engaging with the brand or making a purchase, in exchange for free merchandise.\neBay\u2019s collaborations and influencer marketing efforts are driven by the goal of raising brand awareness and increasing reach. As more than 75% of marketing professionals plan to invest in influencer marketing, eBay is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and achieve their marketing objectives.\nEbay Collaborations with Love Island Contestants\nIn the Love Island collaboration, eBay has partnered with contestants who have a significant influence on social media. These collaborations involve contestants creating and sharing content on their platforms, showcasing their personal style through second-hand clothing and promoting eBay\u2019s range of pre-loved fashion items.\nThis strategic partnership not only benefits eBay by increasing brand visibility, but it also aligns with the rising popularity of pre-loved clothing apps like Vinted, Depop, and Hardly Ever Worn. By associating with Love Island and sustainable fashion choices, eBay can appeal to a broader audience seeking more ethical and environmentally friendly options.\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s collaboration with Love Island contestants and influencers is not limited to the duration of the show. It\u2019s a long-term relationship-building approach, establishing authenticity and trust among the audience. The ongoing engagement helps eBay maintain a strong presence in the minds of their target market, leading to increased conversions and higher customer satisfaction.\nAs eBay continues to innovate and explore new avenues for collaboration and influencer marketing, they remain committed to their overarching goals of sustainability, brand awareness, and credibility.\nUsing Legacy Media for Marketing\nWhile digital advertising dominates the marketing landscape, eBay understands the enduring power of legacy media in reaching a wide audience. One such medium that eBay has leveraged effectively is television advertising.\nTelevision remains a formidable platform for brand building and shaping consumer perceptions. With its broad reach and ability to captivate audiences, TV advertising allows eBay to communicate its key messages to a diverse range of potential buyers.\nDespite the rise of digital channels, TV advertising continues to play a significant role in eBay\u2019s marketing strategy. By utilizing legacy media like TV, eBay can complement its digital efforts and extend its reach to a wider audience.\neBay\u2019s decision to incorporate TV advertising into its marketing mix is supported by its success in other areas. For example, eBay\u2019s promoted listings revenue increased by an impressive 27% to $276 million, outpacing GMV growth by more than 30 points. This achievement demonstrates the effectiveness of eBay\u2019s marketing approach, which combines digital advertising with legacy media.\nMoreover, eBay\u2019s transition from display advertising to promoted listings and CPC ads has yielded positive results, especially when compared to its legacy third-party display ads. While eBay faced industry-wide headwinds with its legacy third-party display ads, these ads represent a smaller portion of its overall advertising mix.\neBay\u2019s emphasis on legacy media like TV advertising is part of its broader marketing strategy to diversify sales channels and reach target audiences effectively. By utilizing both digital and traditional advertising platforms, eBay can leverage its buying intent signals, shopping insights, and transaction-level data to connect brands with their ideal customers.\nAs a testament to the success of eBay\u2019s marketing efforts, over 2 million sellers utilized at least one ad product in Q4, and eBay has over 800,000 sellers promoting over 200 million listings. Promoted listings on eBay have provided sellers with an average boost in visibility of 36% and led to impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 110%.\nAlthough digital advertising has gained significant traction, eBay\u2019s strategic use of legacy media, particularly TV advertising, ensures the company\u2019s marketing efforts are comprehensive and well-rounded. By incorporating legacy media into its marketing mix, eBay continues to connect with a wide range of buyers and create meaningful brand experiences.\neBay\u2019s Approach to Inventory Sourcing\neBay provides sellers with a unique opportunity to expand their product selection through inventory sourcing from government agencies. This enables sellers to find a wide range of unique and in-demand items that can attract buyers and drive sales.\nWith over 1.5 billion listings on the eBay platform and 154 million active buyers worldwide, sellers need to stand out from the competition. Sourcing inventory from government agencies allows sellers to offer products that may not be readily available elsewhere, giving them a competitive edge.\nGovernment agencies often have surplus items or products seized in legal cases that they need to sell. These items can include electronics, vehicles, clothing, and much more. By partnering with government agencies, eBay sellers can access these items and offer them to buyers on the platform.\nWhen sourcing inventory from government agencies, sellers should consider the following:\neBay\u2019s extensive buyer base and powerful search algorithm prioritize relevant results from top sellers. By sourcing inventory from government agencies, sellers can offer unique products that align with the needs and interests of eBay\u2019s diverse community of buyers.\nBy leveraging eBay\u2019s inventory sourcing from government agencies, sellers can enhance their product range, attract more buyers, and increase sales on the platform. It\u2019s an excellent strategy for sellers looking to differentiate themselves and offer unique products that meet the diverse needs of eBay\u2019s global community.\nBest Practices for Customer Service\neBay, with its bustling marketplace and millions of buyers and sellers, understands the crucial role that customer service plays in building trust and cultivating repeat business relationships. Implementing best practices for customer service can lead to enhanced customer satisfaction, improved sales conversion rates, and increased buyer loyalty.\nAccurate Handling Times and Uploading Tracking Information\nStatistics show that providing accurate handling times and uploading tracking information can significantly reduce \u201citem not received\u201d claims, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. By promptly shipping orders and providing tracking details, sellers can create a positive shopping experience and instill confidence in buyers.\nGenerous Returns Policy\nResearch indicates that having a generous returns policy can increase sales conversion rates. Shoppers are more likely to purchase items when they know they can be returned if needed. By offering hassle-free returns, sellers demonstrate their commitment to customer satisfaction and build trust with buyers.\nClear and Accurate Product Listings\nData suggests that clear and accurate product listings, including detailed descriptions and high-quality images, can reduce buyer dissatisfaction and lead to fewer return requests. Sellers should provide comprehensive information about their products, ensuring that buyers have a clear understanding of what they are purchasing.\nRequiring Immediate Payment\nStudies have shown that requiring immediate payment for listings helps prevent unpaid items and reduces the likelihood of payment disputes. This streamlined buying process benefits both sellers and buyers, allowing transactions to be completed smoothly and efficiently.\nPromptly Managing Buyers\u2019 Requests and Resolving Disputes\nAnalytics demonstrate that efficiently managing buyers\u2019 requests and resolving disputes promptly can enhance customer satisfaction levels and cultivate repeat business relationships. By addressing buyer inquiries and issues in a timely manner, sellers demonstrate their dedication to providing excellent customer service.\nExceptional customer service is key on eBay. Promptly responding to inquiries, offering hassle-free return policies, and providing transparent updates on order status can foster trust and loyalty with buyers. By prioritizing customer satisfaction and communication, sellers can differentiate themselves and establish a positive reputation on the platform.\neBay provides various selling tools for free to help sellers manage and promote listings, track sales performance, and analyze customer behavior. Leveraging these tools can assist sellers in delivering exceptional customer service and making dynamic strategy adjustments based on customer insights.\nCultivating a positive seller reputation through responsive communication, transparency, and issue resolution further helps establish trust with buyers. Sellers should strive to provide accurate and helpful information, address buyer concerns promptly, and proactively resolve any issues that may arise.\nBy cross-promoting related listings and encouraging additional sales, sellers can leverage eBay\u2019s platform to their advantage. This strategy not only increases customer interest but also strengthens customer loyalty by offering a seamless shopping experience.\nFurthermore, with mobile shopping on the rise, it is crucial for sellers to ensure that their listings are mobile-friendly. Responsive designs, fast loading speeds, and targeted promotions for mobile users can enhance the shopping experience and drive sales.\nIn conclusion, implementing best practices for customer service is essential for success on eBay. By prioritizing accurate handling times, clear and accurate product listings, prompt communication, and efficient dispute resolution, sellers can enhance customer satisfaction, build buyer loyalty, and foster long-term success on the platform.\neBay Marketing Grants and Support\neBay understands the challenges faced by entrepreneurs and small businesses, and that\u2019s why they have developed the eBay Up & Running Grants program. Now in its 5th year, this program aims to provide vital support to sellers on the platform, empowering them to grow their businesses and achieve long-term success.\nThrough the eBay Up & Running Grants program, 50 U.S. eBay sellers are rewarded with $10,000 each.

    "Summarized_Document1": "In recent years, eBay has implemented a comprehensive marketing strategy to drive its success and maintain its position as a leading online marketplace. This case study delves into eBay\u2019s marketing approach, examining key strategies that have contributed to its continued success. eBay\u2019s revenue model incorporates listing fees, commissions on sales, and advertising revenue. The platform charges a $0.35 fee per listing after a free limit of 200 products and earns a commission through a Final Value Fee and an additional $0.30 per order. Advertising fees from sellers further support eBay\u2019s revenue. Strategic acquisitions like PayPal, Rent.com, Skype, and StubHub have diversified eBay\u2019s revenue streams and strengthened its market position. With over 19 million sellers and more than 1 billion active listings, eBay has established itself as the world\u2019s second most visited online marketplace, boasting over 182 million active users globally. eBay\u2019s marketing approach has evolved beyond its initial auction-based model. The company has invested in traditional media advertising, particularly television, to reshape consumer perceptions and reach a broader audience. This strategy aims to reassert eBay\u2019s unique selling position as a diverse marketplace. Traditional media advertising complements digital marketing by appealing to a wider demographic and enhancing brand recall. eBay\u2019s social media promotion program incentivizes sellers to promote their listings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, reducing fees for successful sales generated through social links. This initiative has led to increased sales and visibility, with plans to expand globally. Collaborations with influencers and reality TV shows like Love Island have further boosted eBay\u2019s brand awareness and commitment to sustainability. eBay\u2019s use of legacy media, such as television advertising, remains a significant part of its marketing strategy. This approach has proven effective, with promoted listings revenue increasing by 27% to $276 million. eBay\u2019s marketing efforts combine digital and traditional advertising to reach a wide audience and create meaningful brand experiences. eBay also offers sellers opportunities to source inventory from government agencies, providing unique and in-demand items that attract buyers. Best practices for customer service, such as accurate handling times, generous returns policies, and clear product listings, enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. The eBay Up & Running Grants program supports small businesses with financial assistance and educational resources. In 2023, eBay awarded over $500,000 in grants and education resources to small businesses. eBay\u2019s international expansion and shipping solutions enable sellers to reach buyers in over 200 countries, reducing risks and costs associated with global transactions. Continuous improvement and seller education are key to success on eBay. The platform provides valuable resources and tools to help sellers optimize their performance and stay ahead of the competition. eBay\u2019s marketing strategy has been instrumental in its success, combining traditional and digital channels to reach its target audience and build a strong reputation. The company\u2019s commitment to customer satisfaction, social media promotion, influencer collaborations, and international expansion positions it for continued growth in the e-commerce industry.",

    "Document1": "Ebay Marketing Strategy 2024: A Case Study\nIn recent years, eBay has implemented a comprehensive marketing strategy to drive its success and maintain its position as a leading online marketplace. With a strong focus on customer experience, innovative partnerships, and global expansion, eBay has seen impressive revenue growth and user engagement. In this case study, we will delve into eBay\u2019s marketing approach and examine the key strategies that have contributed to its continued success.\nKey Takeaways:\nWith its impressive financial performance, eBay\u2019s marketing strategy serves as a testament to its ability to adapt and thrive in the ever-evolving e-commerce landscape. In the following sections, we will explore the various facets of eBay\u2019s marketing approach, providing insights and key learnings for businesses looking to enhance their own strategies.\nExamining eBay\u2019s Revenue Model\neBay, one of the world\u2019s leading online marketplaces, operates on a revenue model that incorporates various sources of income. By understanding how eBay generates revenue, we can gain valuable insights into its business strategy and success.\nAt the core of eBay\u2019s revenue model are listing fees and commissions on sales. For every listing, eBay charges a fee of $0.35, following a free limit of 200 products. This scalable approach enables sellers to list their products while generating revenue for the platform. Additionally, eBay earns a commission on sales through a Final Value Fee, which is a percentage of the final sale price, and an additional charge of $0.30 per order.\nAside from listing fees and commissions, eBay also generates revenue through advertising. Sellers have the option to pay advertising fees to promote their products on the platform, providing them with increased visibility and sales opportunities. This advertising revenue stream further supports eBay\u2019s commitment to creating a thriving marketplace for its sellers.\nOver the years, eBay has expanded its revenue streams through strategic acquisitions. Notable acquisitions such as PayPal, Rent.com, Skype, and StubHub have not only diversified eBay\u2019s revenue but also strengthened its position in the market. These acquisitions have allowed eBay to tap into new markets and revenue sources, further fueling its growth and success.\nWith over 19 million sellers worldwide and more than 1 billion active listings, eBay\u2019s revenue model has proven to be highly effective. It has established itself as the world\u2019s second most visited online marketplace, with over 182 million active users globally. eBay\u2019s revenue model, combined with its wide reach and diverse product offerings, has contributed to its impressive financial performance.\nTake a look at the table below for a snapshot of eBay\u2019s revenue statistics:\nWith its successful revenue model and ongoing innovations, eBay continues to solidify its position in the e-commerce industry. The platform\u2019s dedication to providing sellers with a profitable marketplace and buyers with a wide range of products ensures sustainable growth and long-term success.\neBay\u2019s Marketing Approach \u2013 Beyond Online Car Boot Sales\neBay, initially known as AuctionWatch, revolutionized the e-commerce industry when it was founded in 1995 by computer programmer Pierre Omidyar. What started as a platform for online auctions has evolved into much more. Omidyar\u2019s vision extended beyond a simple auction site; he aimed to create an online community that fostered democratic decision-making, decentralized operations, and open communication.\nDespite its success, eBay has faced challenges in recent years. To overcome the perception of being just an \u201conline car boot sale,\u201d the company has shifted its marketing approach. One significant strategy is investing in traditional media advertising, particularly television. eBay recognizes that traditional media is still a powerful channel for brand building and reshaping consumer perceptions.\nThe decision to invest in traditional media advertising aligns with eBay\u2019s goal of reasserting its unique selling position as the site where buyers and sellers can find anything. By utilizing television ads, eBay has the opportunity to reach a wider audience and showcase the diverse range of products available on the platform.\nAlthough digital marketing platforms have gained prominence, traditional media advertising provides eBay with an advantage. While digital ads can be effective in targeting specific audiences, traditional media appeals to a broader demographic. This broader reach allows eBay to engage with potential buyers and sellers who may not be as active online.\nFurthermore, traditional media advertisements can have a lasting impact on brand recall and recognition. Television commercials, in particular, enable eBay to convey its message visually and emotionally, creating a memorable connection with the audience.\nBy diversifying its marketing approach beyond online advertising, eBay aims to broaden its appeal and attract new users. Additionally, by leveraging traditional media, eBay can address the perception that it is inconvenient compared to more streamlined platforms like Amazon and Facebook.\nDespite the challenges eBay faces, its commitment to brand building through traditional media demonstrates its determination to remain a dominant player in the e-commerce industry. Through television advertisements and other traditional media channels, eBay is actively reshaping consumer perceptions and reviving its brand.\n\nImage alt tag: eBay marketing approach\nLeveraging Social Media for Promotion\nSocial media has become an integral part of people\u2019s lives, offering a powerful platform for businesses to promote their products and services. Recognizing the immense potential of social media, eBay has implemented a program to incentivize sellers to leverage social media platforms for promotion.\nThe eBay social media promotion program provides sellers with the opportunity to reduce their fees for successful sales generated through social links. By actively promoting their listings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, sellers can reach a broader audience and increase their chances of making sales.\nWith 98% of digital consumers being active on social media and 74% of people trusting social media when making purchasing decisions, it is evident that social sharing plays a significant role in driving sales and brand visibility. By encouraging sellers to utilize social media as a promotional tool, eBay aims to enhance the visibility of listings and attract potential buyers.\nThis initiative has proven to be successful, with a notable increase in sales resulting from social media promotion. As a result, eBay plans to expand this program to other markets worldwide, allowing sellers from different regions to benefit from this incentivized social sharing approach.\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s collaboration with influencers on platforms like Instagram has also contributed to increased visibility and sales. With over a billion monthly active users on Instagram and influencer posts generating an average engagement rate of 3.21%, leveraging the reach and influence of social media influencers has become an effective marketing strategy.\n\nSocial Media: A Game Changer for eBay\nSocial media has transformed the way businesses promote and sell their products, and eBay is leveraging this trend to enhance its visibility and drive sales. By incentivizing sellers to promote their listings on social media platforms, eBay is tapping into a vast audience and creating new opportunities for sellers to succeed.\nCollaborations and Influencer Marketing\neBay recognizes the immense power of influencer marketing and the impact it can have on driving brand awareness and increasing product visibility. In an effort to tap into this growing trend, eBay has ventured into exciting collaborations, including a groundbreaking partnership with the hit reality TV show Love Island.\nLove Island, with its massive viewership of 3.2 million during the live final in 2021, offers a great opportunity for eBay to reach a wide audience and promote their commitment to sustainability in the fashion industry. As a new sponsor of Love Island, eBay has taken on the responsibility of replacing fast fashion brands with a focus on second-hand clothing and encouraging viewers to embrace pre-loved fashion.\nThis collaboration enables eBay to leverage the influence of Love Island contestants and popular influencers to advocate for sustainable fashion choices. By working with influencers and bloggers, eBay can enhance its brand awareness and credibility, as well as drive traffic and conversions to their platform.\nThrough collaborations with influencers, eBay can tap into their loyal following on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. By partnering with these individuals, eBay can harness their influence to establish long-term relationships with their target audience, as well as foster trust and credibility.\nProduct reviews, giveaways, and content collaborations are some of the key strategies used in influencer marketing. Influencers not only provide valuable reviews of eBay products, but they also promote specific actions from their audience, such as engaging with the brand or making a purchase, in exchange for free merchandise.\neBay\u2019s collaborations and influencer marketing efforts are driven by the goal of raising brand awareness and increasing reach. As more than 75% of marketing professionals plan to invest in influencer marketing, eBay is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and achieve their marketing objectives.\nEbay Collaborations with Love Island Contestants\nIn the Love Island collaboration, eBay has partnered with contestants who have a significant influence on social media. These collaborations involve contestants creating and sharing content on their platforms, showcasing their personal style through second-hand clothing and promoting eBay\u2019s range of pre-loved fashion items.\nThis strategic partnership not only benefits eBay by increasing brand visibility, but it also aligns with the rising popularity of pre-loved clothing apps like Vinted, Depop, and Hardly Ever Worn. By associating with Love Island and sustainable fashion choices, eBay can appeal to a broader audience seeking more ethical and environmentally friendly options.\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s collaboration with Love Island contestants and influencers is not limited to the duration of the show. It\u2019s a long-term relationship-building approach, establishing authenticity and trust among the audience. The ongoing engagement helps eBay maintain a strong presence in the minds of their target market, leading to increased conversions and higher customer satisfaction.\nAs eBay continues to innovate and explore new avenues for collaboration and influencer marketing, they remain committed to their overarching goals of sustainability, brand awareness, and credibility.\nUsing Legacy Media for Marketing\nWhile digital advertising dominates the marketing landscape, eBay understands the enduring power of legacy media in reaching a wide audience. One such medium that eBay has leveraged effectively is television advertising.\nTelevision remains a formidable platform for brand building and shaping consumer perceptions. With its broad reach and ability to captivate audiences, TV advertising allows eBay to communicate its key messages to a diverse range of potential buyers.\nDespite the rise of digital channels, TV advertising continues to play a significant role in eBay\u2019s marketing strategy. By utilizing legacy media like TV, eBay can complement its digital efforts and extend its reach to a wider audience.\neBay\u2019s decision to incorporate TV advertising into its marketing mix is supported by its success in other areas. For example, eBay\u2019s promoted listings revenue increased by an impressive 27% to $276 million, outpacing GMV growth by more than 30 points. This achievement demonstrates the effectiveness of eBay\u2019s marketing approach, which combines digital advertising with legacy media.\nMoreover, eBay\u2019s transition from display advertising to promoted listings and CPC ads has yielded positive results, especially when compared to its legacy third-party display ads. While eBay faced industry-wide headwinds with its legacy third-party display ads, these ads represent a smaller portion of its overall advertising mix.\neBay\u2019s emphasis on legacy media like TV advertising is part of its broader marketing strategy to diversify sales channels and reach target audiences effectively. By utilizing both digital and traditional advertising platforms, eBay can leverage its buying intent signals, shopping insights, and transaction-level data to connect brands with their ideal customers.\nAs a testament to the success of eBay\u2019s marketing efforts, over 2 million sellers utilized at least one ad product in Q4, and eBay has over 800,000 sellers promoting over 200 million listings. Promoted listings on eBay have provided sellers with an average boost in visibility of 36% and led to impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 110%.\nAlthough digital advertising has gained significant traction, eBay\u2019s strategic use of legacy media, particularly TV advertising, ensures the company\u2019s marketing efforts are comprehensive and well-rounded. By incorporating legacy media into its marketing mix, eBay continues to connect with a wide range of buyers and create meaningful brand experiences.\neBay\u2019s Approach to Inventory Sourcing\neBay provides sellers with a unique opportunity to expand their product selection through inventory sourcing from government agencies. This enables sellers to find a wide range of unique and in-demand items that can attract buyers and drive sales.\nWith over 1.5 billion listings on the eBay platform and 154 million active buyers worldwide, sellers need to stand out from the competition. Sourcing inventory from government agencies allows sellers to offer products that may not be readily available elsewhere, giving them a competitive edge.\nGovernment agencies often have surplus items or products seized in legal cases that they need to sell. These items can include electronics, vehicles, clothing, and much more. By partnering with government agencies, eBay sellers can access these items and offer them to buyers on the platform.\nWhen sourcing inventory from government agencies, sellers should consider the following:\neBay\u2019s extensive buyer base and powerful search algorithm prioritize relevant results from top sellers. By sourcing inventory from government agencies, sellers can offer unique products that align with the needs and interests of eBay\u2019s diverse community of buyers.\nBy leveraging eBay\u2019s inventory sourcing from government agencies, sellers can enhance their product range, attract more buyers, and increase sales on the platform. It\u2019s an excellent strategy for sellers looking to differentiate themselves and offer unique products that meet the diverse needs of eBay\u2019s global community.\nBest Practices for Customer Service\neBay, with its bustling marketplace and millions of buyers and sellers, understands the crucial role that customer service plays in building trust and cultivating repeat business relationships. Implementing best practices for customer service can lead to enhanced customer satisfaction, improved sales conversion rates, and increased buyer loyalty.\nAccurate Handling Times and Uploading Tracking Information\nStatistics show that providing accurate handling times and uploading tracking information can significantly reduce \u201citem not received\u201d claims, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. By promptly shipping orders and providing tracking details, sellers can create a positive shopping experience and instill confidence in buyers.\nGenerous Returns Policy\nResearch indicates that having a generous returns policy can increase sales conversion rates. Shoppers are more likely to purchase items when they know they can be returned if needed. By offering hassle-free returns, sellers demonstrate their commitment to customer satisfaction and build trust with buyers.\nClear and Accurate Product Listings\nData suggests that clear and accurate product listings, including detailed descriptions and high-quality images, can reduce buyer dissatisfaction and lead to fewer return requests. Sellers should provide comprehensive information about their products, ensuring that buyers have a clear understanding of what they are purchasing.\nRequiring Immediate Payment\nStudies have shown that requiring immediate payment for listings helps prevent unpaid items and reduces the likelihood of payment disputes. This streamlined buying process benefits both sellers and buyers, allowing transactions to be completed smoothly and efficiently.\nPromptly Managing Buyers\u2019 Requests and Resolving Disputes\nAnalytics demonstrate that efficiently managing buyers\u2019 requests and resolving disputes promptly can enhance customer satisfaction levels and cultivate repeat business relationships. By addressing buyer inquiries and issues in a timely manner, sellers demonstrate their dedication to providing excellent customer service.\nExceptional customer service is key on eBay. Promptly responding to inquiries, offering hassle-free return policies, and providing transparent updates on order status can foster trust and loyalty with buyers. By prioritizing customer satisfaction and communication, sellers can differentiate themselves and establish a positive reputation on the platform.\neBay provides various selling tools for free to help sellers manage and promote listings, track sales performance, and analyze customer behavior. Leveraging these tools can assist sellers in delivering exceptional customer service and making dynamic strategy adjustments based on customer insights.\nCultivating a positive seller reputation through responsive communication, transparency, and issue resolution further helps establish trust with buyers. Sellers should strive to provide accurate and helpful information, address buyer concerns promptly, and proactively resolve any issues that may arise.\nBy cross-promoting related listings and encouraging additional sales, sellers can leverage eBay\u2019s platform to their advantage. This strategy not only increases customer interest but also strengthens customer loyalty by offering a seamless shopping experience.\nFurthermore, with mobile shopping on the rise, it is crucial for sellers to ensure that their listings are mobile-friendly. Responsive designs, fast loading speeds, and targeted promotions for mobile users can enhance the shopping experience and drive sales.\nIn conclusion, implementing best practices for customer service is essential for success on eBay. By prioritizing accurate handling times, clear and accurate product listings, prompt communication, and efficient dispute resolution, sellers can enhance customer satisfaction, build buyer loyalty, and foster long-term success on the platform.\neBay Marketing Grants and Support\neBay understands the challenges faced by entrepreneurs and small businesses, and that\u2019s why they have developed the eBay Up & Running Grants program. Now in its 5th year, this program aims to provide vital support to sellers on the platform, empowering them to grow their businesses and achieve long-term success.\nThrough the eBay Up & Running Grants program, 50 U.S. eBay sellers are rewarded with $10,000 each.

    "Summarized_Document1": "In recent years, eBay has implemented a comprehensive marketing strategy to drive its success and maintain its position as a leading online marketplace. This case study delves into eBay\u2019s marketing approach, examining key strategies that have contributed to its continued success. eBay\u2019s revenue model incorporates listing fees, commissions on sales, and advertising revenue. The platform charges a $0.35 fee per listing after a free limit of 200 products and earns a commission through a Final Value Fee and an additional $0.30 per order. Advertising fees from sellers further support eBay\u2019s revenue. Strategic acquisitions like PayPal, Rent.com, Skype, and StubHub have diversified eBay\u2019s revenue streams and strengthened its market position. With over 19 million sellers and more than 1 billion active listings, eBay has established itself as the world\u2019s second most visited online marketplace, boasting over 182 million active users globally. eBay\u2019s marketing approach has evolved beyond its initial auction-based model. The company has invested in traditional media advertising, particularly television, to reshape consumer perceptions and reach a broader audience. This strategy aims to reassert eBay\u2019s unique selling position as a diverse marketplace. Traditional media advertising complements digital marketing by appealing to a wider demographic and enhancing brand recall. eBay\u2019s social media promotion program incentivizes sellers to promote their listings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, reducing fees for successful sales generated through social links. This initiative has led to increased sales and visibility, with plans to expand globally. Collaborations with influencers and reality TV shows like Love Island have further boosted eBay\u2019s brand awareness and commitment to sustainability. eBay\u2019s use of legacy media, such as television advertising, remains a significant part of its marketing strategy. This approach has proven effective, with promoted listings revenue increasing by 27% to $276 million. eBay\u2019s marketing efforts combine digital and traditional advertising to reach a wide audience and create meaningful brand experiences. eBay also offers sellers opportunities to source inventory from government agencies, providing unique and in-demand items that attract buyers. Best practices for customer service, such as accurate handling times, generous returns policies, and clear product listings, enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. The eBay Up & Running Grants program supports small businesses with financial assistance and educational resources. In 2023, eBay awarded over $500,000 in grants and education resources to small businesses. eBay\u2019s international expansion and shipping solutions enable sellers to reach buyers in over 200 countries, reducing risks and costs associated with global transactions. Continuous improvement and seller education are key to success on eBay. The platform provides valuable resources and tools to help sellers optimize their performance and stay ahead of the competition. eBay\u2019s marketing strategy has been instrumental in its success, combining traditional and digital channels to reach its target audience and build a strong reputation. The company\u2019s commitment to customer satisfaction, social media promotion, influencer collaborations, and international expansion positions it for continued growth in the e-commerce industry.",

    "Document1": "Ebay Marketing Strategy 2024: A Case Study\nIn recent years, eBay has implemented a comprehensive marketing strategy to drive its success and maintain its position as a leading online marketplace. With a strong focus on customer experience, innovative partnerships, and global expansion, eBay has seen impressive revenue growth and user engagement. In this case study, we will delve into eBay\u2019s marketing approach and examine the key strategies that have contributed to its continued success.\nKey Takeaways:\nWith its impressive financial performance, eBay\u2019s marketing strategy serves as a testament to its ability to adapt and thrive in the ever-evolving e-commerce landscape. In the following sections, we will explore the various facets of eBay\u2019s marketing approach, providing insights and key learnings for businesses looking to enhance their own strategies.\nExamining eBay\u2019s Revenue Model\neBay, one of the world\u2019s leading online marketplaces, operates on a revenue model that incorporates various sources of income. By understanding how eBay generates revenue, we can gain valuable insights into its business strategy and success.\nAt the core of eBay\u2019s revenue model are listing fees and commissions on sales. For every listing, eBay charges a fee of $0.35, following a free limit of 200 products. This scalable approach enables sellers to list their products while generating revenue for the platform. Additionally, eBay earns a commission on sales through a Final Value Fee, which is a percentage of the final sale price, and an additional charge of $0.30 per order.\nAside from listing fees and commissions, eBay also generates revenue through advertising. Sellers have the option to pay advertising fees to promote their products on the platform, providing them with increased visibility and sales opportunities. This advertising revenue stream further supports eBay\u2019s commitment to creating a thriving marketplace for its sellers.\nOver the years, eBay has expanded its revenue streams through strategic acquisitions. Notable acquisitions such as PayPal, Rent.com, Skype, and StubHub have not only diversified eBay\u2019s revenue but also strengthened its position in the market. These acquisitions have allowed eBay to tap into new markets and revenue sources, further fueling its growth and success.\nWith over 19 million sellers worldwide and more than 1 billion active listings, eBay\u2019s revenue model has proven to be highly effective. It has established itself as the world\u2019s second most visited online marketplace, with over 182 million active users globally. eBay\u2019s revenue model, combined with its wide reach and diverse product offerings, has contributed to its impressive financial performance.\nTake a look at the table below for a snapshot of eBay\u2019s revenue statistics:\nWith its successful revenue model and ongoing innovations, eBay continues to solidify its position in the e-commerce industry. The platform\u2019s dedication to providing sellers with a profitable marketplace and buyers with a wide range of products ensures sustainable growth and long-term success.\neBay\u2019s Marketing Approach \u2013 Beyond Online Car Boot Sales\neBay, initially known as AuctionWatch, revolutionized the e-commerce industry when it was founded in 1995 by computer programmer Pierre Omidyar. What started as a platform for online auctions has evolved into much more. Omidyar\u2019s vision extended beyond a simple auction site; he aimed to create an online community that fostered democratic decision-making, decentralized operations, and open communication.\nDespite its success, eBay has faced challenges in recent years. To overcome the perception of being just an \u201conline car boot sale,\u201d the company has shifted its marketing approach. One significant strategy is investing in traditional media advertising, particularly television. eBay recognizes that traditional media is still a powerful channel for brand building and reshaping consumer perceptions.\nThe decision to invest in traditional media advertising aligns with eBay\u2019s goal of reasserting its unique selling position as the site where buyers and sellers can find anything. By utilizing television ads, eBay has the opportunity to reach a wider audience and showcase the diverse range of products available on the platform.\nAlthough digital marketing platforms have gained prominence, traditional media advertising provides eBay with an advantage. While digital ads can be effective in targeting specific audiences, traditional media appeals to a broader demographic. This broader reach allows eBay to engage with potential buyers and sellers who may not be as active online.\nFurthermore, traditional media advertisements can have a lasting impact on brand recall and recognition. Television commercials, in particular, enable eBay to convey its message visually and emotionally, creating a memorable connection with the audience.\nBy diversifying its marketing approach beyond online advertising, eBay aims to broaden its appeal and attract new users. Additionally, by leveraging traditional media, eBay can address the perception that it is inconvenient compared to more streamlined platforms like Amazon and Facebook.\nDespite the challenges eBay faces, its commitment to brand building through traditional media demonstrates its determination to remain a dominant player in the e-commerce industry. Through television advertisements and other traditional media channels, eBay is actively reshaping consumer perceptions and reviving its brand.\n\nImage alt tag: eBay marketing approach\nLeveraging Social Media for Promotion\nSocial media has become an integral part of people\u2019s lives, offering a powerful platform for businesses to promote their products and services. Recognizing the immense potential of social media, eBay has implemented a program to incentivize sellers to leverage social media platforms for promotion.\nThe eBay social media promotion program provides sellers with the opportunity to reduce their fees for successful sales generated through social links. By actively promoting their listings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, sellers can reach a broader audience and increase their chances of making sales.\nWith 98% of digital consumers being active on social media and 74% of people trusting social media when making purchasing decisions, it is evident that social sharing plays a significant role in driving sales and brand visibility. By encouraging sellers to utilize social media as a promotional tool, eBay aims to enhance the visibility of listings and attract potential buyers.\nThis initiative has proven to be successful, with a notable increase in sales resulting from social media promotion. As a result, eBay plans to expand this program to other markets worldwide, allowing sellers from different regions to benefit from this incentivized social sharing approach.\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s collaboration with influencers on platforms like Instagram has also contributed to increased visibility and sales. With over a billion monthly active users on Instagram and influencer posts generating an average engagement rate of 3.21%, leveraging the reach and influence of social media influencers has become an effective marketing strategy.\n\nSocial Media: A Game Changer for eBay\nSocial media has transformed the way businesses promote and sell their products, and eBay is leveraging this trend to enhance its visibility and drive sales. By incentivizing sellers to promote their listings on social media platforms, eBay is tapping into a vast audience and creating new opportunities for sellers to succeed.\nCollaborations and Influencer Marketing\neBay recognizes the immense power of influencer marketing and the impact it can have on driving brand awareness and increasing product visibility. In an effort to tap into this growing trend, eBay has ventured into exciting collaborations, including a groundbreaking partnership with the hit reality TV show Love Island.\nLove Island, with its massive viewership of 3.2 million during the live final in 2021, offers a great opportunity for eBay to reach a wide audience and promote their commitment to sustainability in the fashion industry. As a new sponsor of Love Island, eBay has taken on the responsibility of replacing fast fashion brands with a focus on second-hand clothing and encouraging viewers to embrace pre-loved fashion.\nThis collaboration enables eBay to leverage the influence of Love Island contestants and popular influencers to advocate for sustainable fashion choices. By working with influencers and bloggers, eBay can enhance its brand awareness and credibility, as well as drive traffic and conversions to their platform.\nThrough collaborations with influencers, eBay can tap into their loyal following on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. By partnering with these individuals, eBay can harness their influence to establish long-term relationships with their target audience, as well as foster trust and credibility.\nProduct reviews, giveaways, and content collaborations are some of the key strategies used in influencer marketing. Influencers not only provide valuable reviews of eBay products, but they also promote specific actions from their audience, such as engaging with the brand or making a purchase, in exchange for free merchandise.\neBay\u2019s collaborations and influencer marketing efforts are driven by the goal of raising brand awareness and increasing reach. As more than 75% of marketing professionals plan to invest in influencer marketing, eBay is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and achieve their marketing objectives.\nEbay Collaborations with Love Island Contestants\nIn the Love Island collaboration, eBay has partnered with contestants who have a significant influence on social media. These collaborations involve contestants creating and sharing content on their platforms, showcasing their personal style through second-hand clothing and promoting eBay\u2019s range of pre-loved fashion items.\nThis strategic partnership not only benefits eBay by increasing brand visibility, but it also aligns with the rising popularity of pre-loved clothing apps like Vinted, Depop, and Hardly Ever Worn. By associating with Love Island and sustainable fashion choices, eBay can appeal to a broader audience seeking more ethical and environmentally friendly options.\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s collaboration with Love Island contestants and influencers is not limited to the duration of the show. It\u2019s a long-term relationship-building approach, establishing authenticity and trust among the audience. The ongoing engagement helps eBay maintain a strong presence in the minds of their target market, leading to increased conversions and higher customer satisfaction.\nAs eBay continues to innovate and explore new avenues for collaboration and influencer marketing, they remain committed to their overarching goals of sustainability, brand awareness, and credibility.\nUsing Legacy Media for Marketing\nWhile digital advertising dominates the marketing landscape, eBay understands the enduring power of legacy media in reaching a wide audience. One such medium that eBay has leveraged effectively is television advertising.\nTelevision remains a formidable platform for brand building and shaping consumer perceptions. With its broad reach and ability to captivate audiences, TV advertising allows eBay to communicate its key messages to a diverse range of potential buyers.\nDespite the rise of digital channels, TV advertising continues to play a significant role in eBay\u2019s marketing strategy. By utilizing legacy media like TV, eBay can complement its digital efforts and extend its reach to a wider audience.\neBay\u2019s decision to incorporate TV advertising into its marketing mix is supported by its success in other areas. For example, eBay\u2019s promoted listings revenue increased by an impressive 27% to $276 million, outpacing GMV growth by more than 30 points. This achievement demonstrates the effectiveness of eBay\u2019s marketing approach, which combines digital advertising with legacy media.\nMoreover, eBay\u2019s transition from display advertising to promoted listings and CPC ads has yielded positive results, especially when compared to its legacy third-party display ads. While eBay faced industry-wide headwinds with its legacy third-party display ads, these ads represent a smaller portion of its overall advertising mix.\neBay\u2019s emphasis on legacy media like TV advertising is part of its broader marketing strategy to diversify sales channels and reach target audiences effectively. By utilizing both digital and traditional advertising platforms, eBay can leverage its buying intent signals, shopping insights, and transaction-level data to connect brands with their ideal customers.\nAs a testament to the success of eBay\u2019s marketing efforts, over 2 million sellers utilized at least one ad product in Q4, and eBay has over 800,000 sellers promoting over 200 million listings. Promoted listings on eBay have provided sellers with an average boost in visibility of 36% and led to impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 110%.\nAlthough digital advertising has gained significant traction, eBay\u2019s strategic use of legacy media, particularly TV advertising, ensures the company\u2019s marketing efforts are comprehensive and well-rounded. By incorporating legacy media into its marketing mix, eBay continues to connect with a wide range of buyers and create meaningful brand experiences.\neBay\u2019s Approach to Inventory Sourcing\neBay provides sellers with a unique opportunity to expand their product selection through inventory sourcing from government agencies. This enables sellers to find a wide range of unique and in-demand items that can attract buyers and drive sales.\nWith over 1.5 billion listings on the eBay platform and 154 million active buyers worldwide, sellers need to stand out from the competition. Sourcing inventory from government agencies allows sellers to offer products that may not be readily available elsewhere, giving them a competitive edge.\nGovernment agencies often have surplus items or products seized in legal cases that they need to sell. These items can include electronics, vehicles, clothing, and much more. By partnering with government agencies, eBay sellers can access these items and offer them to buyers on the platform.\nWhen sourcing inventory from government agencies, sellers should consider the following:\neBay\u2019s extensive buyer base and powerful search algorithm prioritize relevant results from top sellers. By sourcing inventory from government agencies, sellers can offer unique products that align with the needs and interests of eBay\u2019s diverse community of buyers.\nBy leveraging eBay\u2019s inventory sourcing from government agencies, sellers can enhance their product range, attract more buyers, and increase sales on the platform. It\u2019s an excellent strategy for sellers looking to differentiate themselves and offer unique products that meet the diverse needs of eBay\u2019s global community.\nBest Practices for Customer Service\neBay, with its bustling marketplace and millions of buyers and sellers, understands the crucial role that customer service plays in building trust and cultivating repeat business relationships. Implementing best practices for customer service can lead to enhanced customer satisfaction, improved sales conversion rates, and increased buyer loyalty.\nAccurate Handling Times and Uploading Tracking Information\nStatistics show that providing accurate handling times and uploading tracking information can significantly reduce \u201citem not received\u201d claims, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. By promptly shipping orders and providing tracking details, sellers can create a positive shopping experience and instill confidence in buyers.\nGenerous Returns Policy\nResearch indicates that having a generous returns policy can increase sales conversion rates. Shoppers are more likely to purchase items when they know they can be returned if needed. By offering hassle-free returns, sellers demonstrate their commitment to customer satisfaction and build trust with buyers.\nClear and Accurate Product Listings\nData suggests that clear and accurate product listings, including detailed descriptions and high-quality images, can reduce buyer dissatisfaction and lead to fewer return requests. Sellers should provide comprehensive information about their products, ensuring that buyers have a clear understanding of what they are purchasing.\nRequiring Immediate Payment\nStudies have shown that requiring immediate payment for listings helps prevent unpaid items and reduces the likelihood of payment disputes. This streamlined buying process benefits both sellers and buyers, allowing transactions to be completed smoothly and efficiently.\nPromptly Managing Buyers\u2019 Requests and Resolving Disputes\nAnalytics demonstrate that efficiently managing buyers\u2019 requests and resolving disputes promptly can enhance customer satisfaction levels and cultivate repeat business relationships. By addressing buyer inquiries and issues in a timely manner, sellers demonstrate their dedication to providing excellent customer service.\nExceptional customer service is key on eBay. Promptly responding to inquiries, offering hassle-free return policies, and providing transparent updates on order status can foster trust and loyalty with buyers. By prioritizing customer satisfaction and communication, sellers can differentiate themselves and establish a positive reputation on the platform.\neBay provides various selling tools for free to help sellers manage and promote listings, track sales performance, and analyze customer behavior. Leveraging these tools can assist sellers in delivering exceptional customer service and making dynamic strategy adjustments based on customer insights.\nCultivating a positive seller reputation through responsive communication, transparency, and issue resolution further helps establish trust with buyers. Sellers should strive to provide accurate and helpful information, address buyer concerns promptly, and proactively resolve any issues that may arise.\nBy cross-promoting related listings and encouraging additional sales, sellers can leverage eBay\u2019s platform to their advantage. This strategy not only increases customer interest but also strengthens customer loyalty by offering a seamless shopping experience.\nFurthermore, with mobile shopping on the rise, it is crucial for sellers to ensure that their listings are mobile-friendly. Responsive designs, fast loading speeds, and targeted promotions for mobile users can enhance the shopping experience and drive sales.\nIn conclusion, implementing best practices for customer service is essential for success on eBay. By prioritizing accurate handling times, clear and accurate product listings, prompt communication, and efficient dispute resolution, sellers can enhance customer satisfaction, build buyer loyalty, and foster long-term success on the platform.\neBay Marketing Grants and Support\neBay understands the challenges faced by entrepreneurs and small businesses, and that\u2019s why they have developed the eBay Up & Running Grants program. Now in its 5th year, this program aims to provide vital support to sellers on the platform, empowering them to grow their businesses and achieve long-term success.\nThrough the eBay Up & Running Grants program, 50 U.S. eBay sellers are rewarded with $10,000 each.

Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.

    "Summarized_Document1": "In recent years, eBay has implemented a comprehensive marketing strategy to drive its success and maintain its position as a leading online marketplace. This case study delves into eBay\u2019s marketing approach, examining key strategies that have contributed to its continued success. eBay\u2019s revenue model incorporates listing fees, commissions on sales, and advertising revenue. The platform charges a $0.35 fee per listing after a free limit of 200 products and earns a commission through a Final Value Fee and an additional $0.30 per order. Advertising fees from sellers further support eBay\u2019s revenue. Strategic acquisitions like PayPal, Rent.com, Skype, and StubHub have diversified eBay\u2019s revenue streams and strengthened its market position. With over 19 million sellers and more than 1 billion active listings, eBay has established itself as the world\u2019s second most visited online marketplace, boasting over 182 million active users globally. eBay\u2019s marketing approach has evolved beyond its initial auction-based model. The company has invested in traditional media advertising, particularly television, to reshape consumer perceptions and reach a broader audience. This strategy aims to reassert eBay\u2019s unique selling position as a diverse marketplace. Traditional media advertising complements digital marketing by appealing to a wider demographic and enhancing brand recall. eBay\u2019s social media promotion program incentivizes sellers to promote their listings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, reducing fees for successful sales generated through social links. This initiative has led to increased sales and visibility, with plans to expand globally. Collaborations with influencers and reality TV shows like Love Island have further boosted eBay\u2019s brand awareness and commitment to sustainability. eBay\u2019s use of legacy media, such as television advertising, remains a significant part of its marketing strategy. This approach has proven effective, with promoted listings revenue increasing by 27% to $276 million. eBay\u2019s marketing efforts combine digital and traditional advertising to reach a wide audience and create meaningful brand experiences. eBay also offers sellers opportunities to source inventory from government agencies, providing unique and in-demand items that attract buyers. Best practices for customer service, such as accurate handling times, generous returns policies, and clear product listings, enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. The eBay Up & Running Grants program supports small businesses with financial assistance and educational resources. In 2023, eBay awarded over $500,000 in grants and education resources to small businesses. eBay\u2019s international expansion and shipping solutions enable sellers to reach buyers in over 200 countries, reducing risks and costs associated with global transactions. Continuous improvement and seller education are key to success on eBay. The platform provides valuable resources and tools to help sellers optimize their performance and stay ahead of the competition. eBay\u2019s marketing strategy has been instrumental in its success, combining traditional and digital channels to reach its target audience and build a strong reputation. The company\u2019s commitment to customer satisfaction, social media promotion, influencer collaborations, and international expansion positions it for continued growth in the e-commerce industry.",

The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR. Please refer to \u201cKey Performance Indicators\u201d below for more information.\n4. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to \u201cNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\u201d below for more information.\n\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/219103\nSOURCE Shopify\n\nQuick links\nResources\nShopify",

And other retailers struggled to compete during the summer shopping holiday.\nKey takeaways:\nConsumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, and although year-over-year growth was modest when compared with the performance of prior Prime Days, it was a small uptick over 2022.\nAmazon is No. 3 in Digital Commerce 360\u2019s new\u00a02023 Global Online Marketplaces Report, which ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by 2023 third-party GMV.\nHow much did Amazon make on Prime Day?\nDigital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon\u2019s sales on Prime Day hit $12.90 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 11 and 12. That\u2019s up 6.7% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2022, which ran July 12 and 13. Last year, sales grew 8.1% over the 2021 event to $12.09 billion. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon\u2019s 2020 event.\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event. That\u2019s up from 300 million last year, Amazon says.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nAmazon, No. 1 in the\u00a0Digital Commerce 360 Top 1000, launched Prime Day in July 2015 to celebrate the web behemoth\u2019s 20th year in business, offering deals on a bunch of products to mark the occasion. As the event evolved, Prime Day turned into a highly anticipated summer sale designed to drum up more business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shopping traffic from deal-seeking consumers.\nThe inaugural Prime Day lasted for 24 hours and encompassed nine countries including the U.S. In 2017, the sale was extended for 30 hours and expanded to a few more markets, and in 2018, Prime Day was a 36-hour event. By 2019, Amazon began running its current two-day sale spanning 18 countries. And this year, more than 20 markets participated.\nWith discounts available only to paying members, Prime Day also is a vehicle for Amazon to sign up more consumers for its popular loyalty plan. The $139-a-year or $14.99-a-month Prime membership program offers perks like free one- or two-day shipping, digital photo storage, and video and music streaming.\nOther retailers sales slow on Prime Day\nAmazon isn\u2019t alone in doing big sales on weekdays in July. Many of its top competitors held sales during the same period, with No. 2 Walmart Inc. returning to the promotional holiday this year after sitting out last year.\nHowever, many retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year, according to Digital Commerce 360\u2019s analysis of Similarweb traffic numbers. Last year, for example, Target Corp. (No. 5 in the Top 1000) grew traffic 42.3% over a control period two weeks prior to Prime Day. This year, traffic was up just 26.9%. Costco Wholesale Corp. (No. 6) went from a 24.6% bump last year to 16.7% this year. Best Buy Co. (No. 7), which usually gets huge increases in traffic as shoppers compare prices on big-ticket items, saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year.\nWalmart, which didn\u2019t participate in Prime Day promos last year, saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%. But even Amazon had a smaller increase in traffic compared to the control period, down less than 1% compared to 2022\u2019s bump.\nSome of this is a difference in promo strategy. Retailers were heavily promotional during the 4th of July holiday period this year, with more offering Independence Day sales than competing with Prime Day. Also, top competitors offered week-long sales, meaning shoppers could focus on Amazon during its two-day sale and turn to Target, Walmart and Costco afterward to pick up other deals.\nFor the full week, Target\u2019s bump was still lower than last year, but the decline was much softer, with an 18.6% decline for the week compared to a 36.5% decline for the two-day period. Walmart\u2019s bump similarly grew when looking at the full week, up 56.0% for the week compared to a 49.2% increase for the two-day period.\nHow we got here\nHere are some insights that helped Digital Commerce 360 derive its Amazon Prime Day sales estimates:\nConsumer spending up on Amazon during Prime Day\nAccording to figures from a Numerator panel, Prime Day shoppers\u2019 spending on the site went up in 2023. The firm derives its insights from purchasing patterns on the Amazon platform. For the full 48-hour period, the average order value registered $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\nUS Ecommerce: Poised for Takeoff? Insights from Digital Commerce 360\nNumerator data is based on 98,462 Prime Day orders placed through Amazon and spanning 34,185 unique households as well as a survey of more than 4,200 verified buyers.\nOutside of Amazon, sales weren\u2019t so rosy. Salesforce says non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second, with average discounts dropping to 18% this year compared to 30% last year.\u00a0According to the Commerce Cloud provider, discounting was higher during the 4th of July period, peaking at 25% on the holiday.\nStill, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, according to Adobe Analytics. The insights arm of technology company Adobe Inc. said U.S. ecommerce sales hit $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data of 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and 100 million SKUs.\nAmazon said the first day of the sales event marked its largest single-day sales ever.\nMerchants weigh in\nAndrey Klen is pleased with how things went for his company on Amazon.com during Prime Day this year. The co-founder and chief marketing officer of Petcube said \u201cPrime Day performed much better in comparison to the previous year. Compared to an average day, we\u2019ve seen a double-digit multiple on sales. We were able to beat optimistic high growth projections on our main product.\u201d\nKlen said sales numbers suggest that shoppers were excited about Prime Day this year and had planned purchases of Petcube products well in advance of the two-day sales event.\n\u201cWe had lower conversion a couple of days prior to Prime Day, followed by the massive explosion for the first hours on the date. Most likely, people were adding the products to the cart beforehand,\u201d Klen said.\nThrasio Holdings Inc., an investment company that has purchased a number of Amazon merchants, said some of its brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\u201cThese were the two most profitable days in Thrasio history,\u201d Thrasio CEO\u00a0Greg Greeley said in a written statement.\nThrasio\u2019s latest acquisition \u2014 a seller of insect-repellent spray called Ranger Ready Repellents \u2014 had a record-breaking day on Amazon and tripled its Prime Day 2022 sales.\nDo you rank in our databases?\nSubmit your data\u00a0and we\u2019ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\nSign up\nStay on top of the latest developments in the ecommerce industry.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon nears $13 billion in Prime Day sales\nAmazon boosted its overall Prime Day sales to record numbers, but growth is slowing. Consumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, with a 6.7% year-over-year increase to $12.90 billion globally during the event on July 11 and 12, 2024. This is up from $12.09 billion in 2022 and $11.19 billion in 2021.\n\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities, and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\n\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event, up from 300 million last year. The average order value was $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\n\nOther retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year. For example, Target Corp. grew traffic 26.9% this year compared to 42.3% last year. Costco Wholesale Corp. saw a bump of 16.7% this year compared to 24.6% last year. Best Buy Co. saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year. Walmart saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%.\n\nSales outside of Amazon weren\u2019t as strong. Salesforce reported non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second. However, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, hitting $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data.\n\nMerchants like Petcube and Thrasio Holdings Inc. reported significant sales increases during Prime Day. Petcube saw a double-digit multiple on sales compared to an average day, and Thrasio\u2019s brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\nIn summary, Amazon's Prime Day 2024 had a significant impact on total revenue in July 2024, with nearly $13 billion in sales, marking a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Other retailers experienced mixed results, with some seeing smaller traffic increases and others reporting declines in sales.",

Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning.

The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

    "Summarized_Document1": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

We then ranked each school according to the top variables college students selected in our College Choice and Admissions Survey. To learn more, check out our full rankings methodology or read the summary below.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRanking Methodology Summary\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo qualify for our rankings lists, each school must be an accredited public or private, nonprofit institution. Each eligible school was then ranked based on a formula measuring:\n\n\nIn addition, we only included colleges with graduation rates in the top third of all online colleges.\nFlorida College Tuition\nCollege tuition runs far cheaper in Florida than the national average. Undergraduates attending public four-year colleges in Florida in 2022-2023 paid $4,540 for tuition and fees, about $5,000 less than the national average.\nPrivate college students in Florida also pay less, spending an average of $30,928 in tuition and fees, while the national average for private college tuition was $35,248 in 2022-2023.\nFlorida online colleges may offer a more affordable education since you don't need to pay for transportation and on-campus housing fees, though online learners sometimes need to pay technology fees not charged to on-campus students.\nIn addition, online tuition often costs less than studying on campus. For instance, in-state undergrads at the University of Florida pay $6,380 per year, while in-state undergrads at UF Online pay $3,876 per year. In this case, attending the University of Florida Online will save you nearly 50% in tuition.\nWhy Study Online in Florida?\nOnline learning offers many benefits beyond convenience, affordability, and flexibility. Here are five reasons you should consider online universities in Florida.\n1. Study at Your Own Pace\nOnline learning blends independent study with live or prerecorded lectures, discussions, and virtual assistance.

Lower Cost of Living\nFlorida offers a moderate cost of living, with a cost-of-living index of 102.4%. The cost-of-living index measures the cost of housing, food, healthcare, and other basic expenses in a state compared to the national average. Florida has the 33rd lowest cost of living.\n3. More Diverse Classrooms\nMany Florida colleges accept online learners from across state lines or even internationally, which allows you to make connections across the nation and world. Online programs attract a diverse selection of students to learn with and from.\n4. Flexible and Convenient Format\nYou can earn your degree online without traveling to campus or attend a hybrid program that incorporates in-person learning. Students can choose classes that work around their work schedule and family life.\n5. Growing Job Market\nFlorida saw a 2.6% job growth rate from July 2022-2023, compared to 1.9% nationally, according to the Florida governor's office. In fact, the private sector in Florida added 42,800 jobs in July 2023. Students attending college in Florida will graduate into a healthy job market.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Online Colleges in Florida\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the easiest online college to get into in Florida?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, is one of the easiest online colleges to get into in the Sunshine State.

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

Each eligible school was then ranked based on a formula measuring:\n\n\nIn addition, we only included colleges with graduation rates in the top third of all online colleges.\nFlorida College Tuition\nCollege tuition runs far cheaper in Florida than the national average. Undergraduates attending public four-year colleges in Florida in 2022-2023 paid $4,540 for tuition and fees, about $5,000 less than the national average.\nPrivate college students in Florida also pay less, spending an average of $30,928 in tuition and fees, while the national average for private college tuition was $35,248 in 2022-2023.\nFlorida online colleges may offer a more affordable education since you don't need to pay for transportation and on-campus housing fees, though online learners sometimes need to pay technology fees not charged to on-campus students.\nIn addition, online tuition often costs less than studying on campus.

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "ARTICLE Online vs in-person learning in higher education: effects on student achievement and recommendations for leadership Bandar N. Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Summarized_Document2": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",

Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation.

However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life.

This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test.

In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

We then ranked each school according to the top variables college students selected in our College Choice and Admissions Survey. To learn more, check out our full rankings methodology or read the summary below.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRanking Methodology Summary\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo qualify for our rankings lists, each school must be an accredited public or private, nonprofit institution.

For instance, in-state undergrads at the University of Florida pay $6,380 per year, while in-state undergrads at UF Online pay $3,876 per year. In this case, attending the University of Florida Online will save you nearly 50% in tuition.\nWhy Study Online in Florida?\nOnline learning offers many benefits beyond convenience, affordability, and flexibility. Here are five reasons you should consider online universities in Florida.\n1. Study at Your Own Pace\nOnline learning blends independent study with live or prerecorded lectures, discussions, and virtual assistance. As an online learner, you may work primarily asynchronously, meeting deadlines each week, or attend live classes, where you can interact with instructors and classmates.\n2. Lower Cost of Living\nFlorida offers a moderate cost of living, with a cost-of-living index of 102.4%. The cost-of-living index measures the cost of housing, food, healthcare, and other basic expenses in a state compared to the national average. Florida has the 33rd lowest cost of living.\n3. More Diverse Classrooms\nMany Florida colleges accept online learners from across state lines or even internationally, which allows you to make connections across the nation and world. Online programs attract a diverse selection of students to learn with and from.\n4. Flexible and Convenient Format\nYou can earn your degree online without traveling to campus or attend a hybrid program that incorporates in-person learning. Students can choose classes that work around their work schedule and family life.\n5. Growing Job Market\nFlorida saw a 2.6% job growth rate from July 2022-2023, compared to 1.9% nationally, according to the Florida governor's office. In fact, the private sector in Florida added 42,800 jobs in July 2023. Students attending college in Florida will graduate into a healthy job market.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Online Colleges in Florida\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the easiest online college to get into in Florida?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, is one of the easiest online colleges to get into in the Sunshine State. The college admitted 100% of applicants in the fall of 2023.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the University of Miami, which admitted 19% of the 48,286 applicants in the fall of 2023, has one of the most selective admission processes in Florida, according to NCES. UM offers 10 online master's and doctoral programs and 12 certificates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIs it hard to get into the University of Florida Online?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe University of Florida Online is easier to get into than the University of Florida main campus. In fall 2023, the University of Florida received 65,375 applications and accepted 24%. Compare that to UF Online, which in fall 2023 got 1,440 applications and admitted 64%.\nYou can apply to UF's main campus as a first-year, transfer, graduate, or professional student. Transfer students to the main campus need at least 60 college credits, while UF Online accepts lower-division transfer students with only 12 credits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIs online college free in Florida?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nNo, an online degree is not free in Florida. That said, you can find non-credit online courses at institutions such as South Florida State College. Florida students may also apply for fee waivers or exemptions, which provide discounts or an entirely free education. Students from foster care or those who meet financial need requirements may apply.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the fastest degree to get online?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nYou can find accelerated degrees in a variety of subjects: art, business management, English, and computer science. Many colleges allow online learners to complete traditional degrees faster than average timelines. Shortened semesters may allow students to take more classes per academic year, and generous transfer policies allow you to graduate quicker.\nFor instance, Everglades University offers a bachelor's in business administration that you can complete in three and a half years instead of the traditional four years.\n Explore More College Resources \nColleges in Orlando, Florida: All 6 Schools\nBest College Towns in Florida\nApply Today to These 20+ Florida Scholarships\nBestColleges.com is an advertising-supported site.

    "Summarized_Document1": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",

This guide will teach you all you need to know about ACT scores!\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIf you want to evaluate how you compare to other test-takers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach you everything you need to know about your scores, including average ACT scores, percentiles, highest ACT scores possible, and much more.\nAverage ACT Scores (2024)\nACT scores range from 1 to 36 in each category (except for writing, out of 12). The average of your four scores determines your ACT composite score. According to ACT Score National Ranks, the average score in each category is:\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to know how the ACT is scored. \u00c2\u00a0First, the number of questions you got correct in each section is counted and converted to scale scores.\nThe average ACT score is 19.9. These rankings are based on almost 4.5 million \u00e2\u0080\u009cACT-tested high school graduates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe ACT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website also released score information for students who decided to take the optional writing test, which contributes to an English Language Arts score (ELA). The average writing and ELA scores are 6.2 and 18.3, respectively. Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test.\nAverage ACT Scores by State\nBelow is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAverage ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US\nLet's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States.\nHighest Possible ACT Score\u00c2\u00a0\nThe highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test.\nACT Scores By Percentile\u00c2\u00a0\nACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nSource: ACT.org\nBased on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive).\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile.\u00c2\u00a0\nOverall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nAre you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies.\nFAQs\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs!\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good?\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application.\u00c2\u00a0\n4. What Is a Low ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nLike what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to?\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce your ACT score is released, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant!\u00c2\u00a0\n6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT?\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant.\n7. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lowest Possible ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe lowest ACT score possible is 1.\n8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section?\nThe average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc.\n9. What is The Average Science ACT Score?\nThe average science ACT score is 20.\nFinal Thoughts\nNow that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.\u00c2\u00a0 A good way to go about it is to test your skills with our Free ACT Practice Questions Pop Quiz.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Reviewed by: Mary Banks Former Admissions Committee Member, Columbia University Reviewed: 4/1/24 If you choose to take the ACT over the SAT, you\u2019ll want to achieve the highest ACT score possible to show your college readiness. This guide will teach you all you need to know about ACT scores! If you want to evaluate how you compare to other test-takers, we\u2019ll teach you everything you need to know about your scores, including average ACT scores, percentiles, highest ACT scores possible, and much more. Average ACT Scores (2024) ACT scores range from 1 to 36 in each category (except for writing, out of 12). The average of your four scores determines your ACT composite score. According to ACT Score National Ranks, the average score in each category is: The average ACT score is 19.9. These rankings are based on almost 4.5 million \u201cACT-tested high school graduates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\u201d The ACT\u2019s website also released score information for students who decided to take the optional writing test, which contributes to an English Language Arts score (ELA). The average writing and ELA scores are 6.2 and 18.3, respectively. Remember, you\u2019ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test. Average ACT Scores by State Below is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing. Average ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US Let's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States. Highest Possible ACT Score The highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score. However, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test. ACT Scores By Percentile ACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category. For example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you. Based on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u2019ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive). However, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile. Overall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time. Are you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies. FAQs If you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs! 1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good? Although a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score. 2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College? While even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness. 3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score? While it\u2019s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application. 4. What Is a Low ACT Score? Like what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low. 5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to? Once your ACT score is released, you\u2019ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant! 6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT? If your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant. 7. What\u2019s the Lowest Possible ACT Score? The lowest ACT score possible is 1. 8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section? The average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc. 9. What is The Average Science ACT Score? The average science ACT score is 20. Final Thoughts Now that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher. If you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",

This compensation does not influence our school rankings, resource guides, or other editorially-independent information published on this site.\nAll About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\nWriter\nEditor & Writer\nWriter\nEditor & Writer\nData Summary\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, the majority of them juniors and seniors.Note Reference [1] By comparison, 1.4 million students took the alternative standardized test, the American College Test (ACT), in the same year.\nA growing number of colleges no longer require standardized test scores, including all of the Ivy League schools. However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",

For decades, the industry has been an important contributor to Europe\u2019s economic growth, innovation, and prosperity, accounting for almost 7 percent of the region\u2019s GDP and being directly or indirectly responsible for employing almost 14 million people.1\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, European Commission, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d ACEA, September 1, 2022; 25 actions for a successful restart of the EU\u2019s automotive sector, CLEPA, May 2020. The industry also carries significant symbolic weight; taglines such as \u201cMade in Germany,\u201d \u201cItalian car design,\u201d \u201cEuro NCAP for Saver Cars,\u201d and \u201cBritish racing\u201d have come to stand for European innovation and craftsmanship.\nHowever, the status quo is being challenged and the industry faces massive ongoing transformations, such as the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains and a shift in focus from hardware to differentiation through software. This dynamic has allowed new entrants in Europe and abroad\u2014especially in China, the largest automotive market in the world2\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d China - Country Commercial Guide, International Trade Administration, updated April 7, 2023.\u2014to disrupt the market and win market share. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports for the first time, with exports of about 3.0 million vehicles, in contrast to Germany\u2019s 2.6 million.3\u201cWhat if Germany stopped making cars?,\u201d Economist, July 31, 2023. These transformative forces overlap with a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, including rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. All of these factors have greatly affected the European auto industry and make navigating the sector\u2019s transformation challenging. A prosperous future for the European automotive industry will therefore depend on how well and quickly it responds and how European stakeholders can shape the necessary conditions for future success. The need for action is urgent.\nTo that end, we have sketched a road map that covers seven areas. Executing on this plan will require action from a variety of industry stakeholders. Speedy action from automotive companies will be important, but the regional ecosystem, including the public sector and multiple adjacent sectors, will need to participate in shaping a level playing field and a fertile environment for the future of the European automotive industry.\nA multidecade success story\nThe European automotive industry has been an engine powering prosperity and growth, employment, and innovation and has contributed to Europe\u2019s image and perception on the global stage (Exhibit 1).\nAn economic powerhouse for the region, the automotive industry contributed about 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exports in 2022.425 actions for a successful restart, May 2020; \u201cEuropean Union exports by category,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023. The sector\u2019s more than 17,300 companies form a network of OEMs and suppliers of all tiers.5\u201cImpact of electromobility on the European automotive industry,\u201d HitHorizons, February 21, 2022. Significantly, the industry directly or indirectly employs more than 6 percent of the region\u2019s workforce,6\u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d September 1, 2022. creating positive spillover effects outside the sector.\nThe automotive industry has also been a nexus of innovation. Technical champions and small and medium-size businesses within the ecosystem have continuously innovated, especially in the areas of combustion engine powertrain, chassis, safety systems, and exterior and interior design. Indeed, about 30 percent of global automotive patents originated from European countries, the most of any region.7McKinsey analysis based on data about automotive industry global patents from IPlytics and Innography by Clarivate, accessed June 12, 2023. Significant investments into research and development have helped European automakers introduce new technologies that have contributed to major advances in sustainability and safety by improving fuel economies and reducing emissions, noise, and accidents.\nProgress and investment in the European auto industry over the past several decades have contributed to Europe\u2019s global image. German engineering is widely touted,8Dave Taylor, \u201cWho owns the idea of German engineering among German car brands?,\u201d Taylor Brand Group, April 8, 2013. and our research suggests many European automakers are considered front-runners in sustainability, with some of the most ambitious targets around electric vehicles (EVs), decarbonization, and safety.\nThanks in part to this work, the brand value of the ten largest European auto companies is conservatively estimated at a combined \u20ac200 billion; five of the ten most valuable car brands worldwide are European.9\u201cLargest automakers by market capitalization,\u201d CompaniesMarketcap.com, accessed August 15, 2023; brand value analysis based on 2023 data on European automotive companies from Brand Finance, accessed June 20, 2023; Alex Haigh, \u201c2022 Automotive industry trends: Doubling down on electric and connected cars,\u201d Brand Finance, February 22, 2022. The grand challenge now is to maintain and build on these assets in the face of profound and accelerating change.\nDisruption and transformation\nThe historic strengths and recently reported record margins of European OEMs may create a false sense of safety for the industry. Accelerated disruptions around electrification, software, and new competitive pressures loom.\nSubstantial market disruptions have been observed in other industries, with serious outcomes. For instance, European manufacturers lost more than 90 percent of their share of the smartphone market in just six years.10\u201cGlobal market share held by Nokia smartphones from 1st quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2013,\u201d Statista Research Department, July 25, 2013. McKinsey analysis shows that leading players in the film camera industry lost similar market share over nine years.\nMarket share data suggest that European OEMs\u2019 leadership position is being challenged as new entrants, especially from China, gain traction. Our analysis also suggests that European market conditions for local development and production are becoming less competitive. Analysis from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility shows that since 2019, European incumbents have lost six percentage points of market share in their home market and five percentage points in China. Meanwhile, Chinese OEMs are gaining ground in both China and Europe, reaching 45 percent market share in their home market in 2022 and octupling their market share in Europe between 2020 and 2022.11McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. This dynamic is even more apparent in battery electric vehicles (BEVs): new EV-focused entrants hold 51 percent of the global BEV market (Exhibit 2).12McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. Besides market share, European OEMs also face the challenge of running profitable BEV businesses.\nA more detailed look at different segments offers a more nuanced picture of the industry. In the premium segment\u2014home turf for many European OEMs\u2014European OEMs still hold 71 percent of global sales. But this segment is also becoming more challenging to hold: newcomers claimed 18 percent of the premium market in 2022.13McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023.\nThis shake-up stems from the fast pace of change in the industry. The transition from internal-combustion-engine (ICE) to zero-emissions vehicles is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80 percent per year since 2020. McKinsey analysis suggests that many global mobility markets will reach near-total EV penetration by the mid-2030s. In response, European OEMs have announced ambitious electrification plans to launch more than 150 EV models through 2030, according to McKinsey analysis.\nThe EV transition drives the industry\u2019s emphasis away from hardware toward software and digital. According to our analysis, EV consumers are more than twice as likely to switch brands for better in-vehicle technology, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features and connectivity services. Our research shows that successful automakers are developing cars defined by software, resulting in a tripling of software content per vehicle since 2015.\nWith electrified, software-defined cars becoming the norm, semiconductors and batteries are the new industry control points. In fact, more than a third of the value of a BEV is associated with the battery. Consequently, the European supplier landscape is changing rapidly, and new capabilities are needed in development and manufacturing.\nRecently, software development and hardware development are increasingly decoupling. We\u2019ve observed that European suppliers have become proficient at the interaction between software and hardware in the context of specific control units that oversee specific components of a car, such as the engine or transmission. Modern vehicles may have as many as 150 control units in a distributed software architecture. Hardware and software will increasingly decouple as software becomes more centralized into domains such as the powertrain and in-vehicle connectivity\u2014and, eventually, into computers that oversee zones of the vehicle rather than components.\nAs a result of this shift toward more centralized computing, portions of vehicles may become commoditized, and scale and incremental improvements may become the main drivers of competitiveness. As a result, several component markets increasingly resemble the smartphone industry, in which the core differentiator is software innovation\u2014in addition to economies of scale, industrial excellence, and quality in hardware. McKinsey analysis suggests that the number of build-to-print suppliers (which manufacture products and components to customers\u2019 detailed engineering instructions) in the automotive industry that provide components such as power electronics will increase. We\u2019ve found that about a third of OEMs\u2019 requests for quotes in some powertrain components and systems are already build-to-print requests.\nNew entrants are moving to supply the automotive market with critical future technologies such as batteries, semiconductors, and software. Traditional suppliers find themselves sandwiched between \u201chigh-tech commodity\u201d companies that provide semiconductors and batteries upstream and cost-pressured incumbent OEMs downstream. This dynamic threatens European supply chains. Consider that the current battery value chain is largely controlled by Chinese companies (Exhibit 3).\nTo counteract these developments and form a strong supply network like the one Europe created during the ICE era, major industry participants are announcing strategic partnerships to secure access to resources and manufacturing capacity, especially for batteries and semiconductors. For example, some incumbents plan to strengthen their control over critical portions of the value chain by partnering with mine operators or even acquiring stakes in mines.14\u201cFactbox: Automakers accelerate drive to secure battery raw materials,\u201d Reuters, April 3, 2023; Victoria Waldersee, \u201cVolkswagen to invest in mines in bid to become global battery supplier,\u201d Reuters, March 17, 2023. While these actions are steps in the right direction, the projected supply and capacity are not yet enough to meet the region\u2019s forecast demand by 2030. Accelerated efforts are necessary.\nMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\nIn a perfect storm for the European auto industry, the current macroeconomic climate is turbulent, with multiple ongoing crises. Compared with other regions, Europe is particularly exposed and affected, and the automotive sector is at a disadvantage compared with other important industries. These challenges fall into five major areas:\nEnergy and resources. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe have surged to twice the costs in the United States and triple costs in China.1McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cChina electricity prices,\u201d GlobalPetrolPrices.com, December 2022; \u201cMidwest Information Office: Average energy prices for the United States, regions, census divisions, and selected metropolitan areas,\u201d US Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 17, 2023; and \u201cElectricity price statistics,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. This creates challenges for the auto industry, in which a significant portion of production costs come from energy requirements.\nGeopolitical tensions. The European auto industry generates a significant\u2014and higher compared with other regions\u2014share of its revenues through exports,2McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cInternational trade in cars,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. which means current geopolitical pressures have an outsize impact on European automakers.\nSupply chain challenges. Compared with other industries, the auto industry relies more heavily on timely deliveries of parts and components from international markets. The European auto industry is therefore at considerable risk when finely tuned international supply chains are disrupted.\nInflation. Inflation has hit Europe much more severely than the United States or China, with labor costs for European automakers disproportionately affected compared with other industries.3\u201cConsumer prices up 4.9 percent from April 2022 to April 2023,\u201d\u00a0TED: The Economics Daily, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 15, 2023.\nProductivity crisis. Europe\u2019s productivity and economic growth lag behind those of its peers, particularly in areas such as software engineering in which the auto industry needs significant additional capacity.4\u201cUnited States full year GDP growth,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cPriority reforms key for sustaining growth and achieving China\u2019s long-term goals - World Bank report,\u201d World Bank, June 14, 2023.\nFinally, these transformative forces overlap with a European macroeconomic environment that has a particularly acute impact on the region\u2019s auto industry (see sidebar \u201cMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\u201d).\nRoad map for the European automotive industry\nThe European auto industry is in the midst of the greatest change in its history. In service of helping the industry remain globally competitive we outline a road map of seven pillars for stakeholders to act on (Exhibit 4). The time to act is now: according to our analysis, European automotive OEMs and suppliers earn about three times the revenue of their Chinese counterparts and five times the EBIT, which means the European industry can act from a position of strength.\nA rapid response from OEMs and suppliers in the European auto industry will be important. But other stakeholders\u2014including adjacent industries such as the energy, research, and public sectors\u2014would also need to act collaboratively to provide an environment that enables success for the European automotive industry (and mobility ecosystem) of the future. In short, the ecosystem approach that made Europe strong in the ICE era has to be translated to serve the era of software-defined, electrified cars.\nRevive strengths in customer understanding, product design, and brand\nThe European automotive industry will need to extend its legacy of cutting-edge product design and superior brand value and transfer it into the new context of software-defined electric vehicles.\nOf the 25 global brands with the highest brand value, all but three are European.15\u201cLuxury & premium 2023 ranking,\u201d Brandirectory, Brand Finance, accessed August 15, 2023. Our data show that brand remains among the top five purchase criteria for European, American, and Chinese auto consumers. However, in the age of electrification and software-defined cars, purchase criteria will change and brand rankings might get reshuffled.\nTo maintain superior brand value, European incumbent OEMs would need to analyze and understand customer needs and preferences to build desirable products. Traditional consumer segmentation would need to be adapted for the era of software-defined electric vehicles, with more-detailed consumer profiles and more-granular user profiles. Owning and analyzing consumer data will enable OEMs to offer tailored mobility solutions and seamlessly engage consumers across the life cycle. They can also build their product development organizations to reflect customer journeys and experiences, which would bring operational roles closer to the customer. As consumers\u2019 desires change and technology advances, OEMs would need to continuously update their software remotely to bring the most up-to-date functionality to customers and meet their needs.\nFocus relentlessly on cost and speed\nMcKinsey research from 2022 shows that the vehicle purchase price is the most important buying factor for consumers across markets.16Annual MCFM Consumer Survey 2022, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, global n = 27,869, December 2022. Particularly in EVs, Chinese OEMs can turn their cost advantage into a competitive edge: our analysis shows that their costs are 20 to 30 percent lower than those of European OEMs.\nTo catch up, European OEMs could drive down costs strategically. According to our analysis, European OEMs could close up to 20 percentage points of the cost gap by adopting structural product design, vertically integrating battery production, scaling EV production, and improving productivity. For example, battery insourcing could decrease European OEMs\u2019 costs by three percentage points, and cost-efficient battery cell chemistry alternatives could save five to six percentage points for some vehicles and segments. As for the remaining 5 to 10 percentage-point cost gap, European OEMs could identify differentiating features that consumers would be willing to pay a premium for, such as brand differentiation; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership; and superior safety performance.\nSpeed is another consideration. McKinsey analysis shows that European OEMs have a long development cycle compared with competitors from other regions, with concept-to-pilot phases lasting up to four years. By contrast, we\u2019ve found that the fastest automakers in China need only 21 months to move from concept to pilot, allowing them to respond to market trends much more quickly.\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not necessarily appropriate to make direct comparisons between the Chinese and European automotive sectors or development cycles. However, European OEMs should take on the challenge and redesign their own processes to accelerate innovation, development, and industrialization. For instance, the product design process could be accelerated through iterative styling methods. Subsequent product development could be optimized by decoupling hardware and software development and by applying agile principles to software development. Across all processes, co-locating cross-domain teams and setting up task forces for products that are behind schedule or components with supply bottlenecks can further accelerate development.\nExecute a winning strategy for the Chinese market\nOur research shows China will remain the biggest automotive market in the future, which means winning in China will be important for European OEMs and suppliers that want to play a globally relevant role.\nEuropean incumbents have lost five percentage points of market share in China since 2019, a substantial decrease. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that Chinese automakers are outpacing their competitors and have gained more than ten percentage points of market share in China, driven by their hold on more than 80 percent of the EV market.17McKinsey analysis based on global passenger-car sales data from IHS Markit, 2002\u201322, accessed May 20, 2023.\nHow have they done it? Chinese OEMs offer significantly lower price points, and their products are more appealing and tailored to Chinese consumers\u2019 needs and preferences. They also bring targeted innovations to market rapidly; our research shows that more than 70 percent of new vehicles unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April 2023 came from Chinese OEMs.\nLike their OEM counterparts, European automotive suppliers have a hard time gaining traction with Chinese EV players, especially for EV powertrain components and systems. While Western suppliers have held more than half of China\u2019s ICE powertrain market, they hold less than 5 percent of the EV powertrain market.18McKinsey analysis based on IHS Markit Production Forecast, number of model launches by powertrain for Aion, BMW, BYD, Mercedes-Benz, NIO, Tesla, Volkswagen and Xpeng, data as of 2022, accessed June 10, 2023.\nEuropean OEMs and suppliers would need a fundamental strategic overhaul to regain competitiveness in China and meet the preferences of Chinese customers. This starts with developing products specifically tailored for the Chinese market. According to our research, the average customer in China is 34 years old, compared with 58 in Europe. These consumers have significantly different purchasing criteria. For instance, Chinese consumers place higher value on cutting-edge technology, connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, and on-board multimedia screens than European and American consumers do. Chinese car buyers also favor simplified vehicle choices with preconfigured options.19Thomas Fang, Mingyu Guan, Bill Peng, and Tony Zhou, \u201cMcKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2023,\u201d July 14, 2023.\nTo implement a \u201clocal for local\u201d strategy\u2014in which R&D, production, and distribution are in close proximity to where products will be bought and used\u2014European players would need to adjust their operating models for the Chinese market. For example, OEMs could localize research and development capabilities and transfer decision rights to local management. Entering local partnerships across the portfolio and supply chain will also be essential to develop a strong foothold in China and to benefit from the know-how and reputations of local partners.\nCreate resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains\nTo reduce bottlenecks and dependencies, the industry will need resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains centered on batteries, semiconductors, and green materials. In 2021, the chip crisis led to a loss of ten million vehicles in global production,20\u201cS&P Global Mobility on short- & long-term impact from chip shortage,\u201d Auto Remarketing, July 14, 2023. highlighting a need to increase supply chain resilience.\nTo create resilient supply, localization is vital. We project that the European supply\u2013demand gap for batteries will reach almost 40 percent, or 500 gigawatt-hours (GWh), by 2030. To cover European battery demand locally, an additional 20 gigafactories, a \u20ac35 billion investment, would be needed.21McKinsey Battery Insights analysis assumes a 500-GWh supply\u2013demand gap and average capital expenditures of \u20ac70 million per gigawatt hour in Europe. This leads to a \u20ac35 million investment need, in addition to the already announced \u20ac70 million for planned and existing factories in Europe. The continent would also need 37 new semiconductor fabs to cover local demand, requiring a \u20ac190 billion investment.22Annual report 2020: The automotive industry in facts and figures, Verband der Automobilindustrie, 2020. As a first step, the European Chips Act will provide \u20ac43 billion in subsidies. Next steps could involve expanding the ecosystem along the value chain while safeguarding crucial supplies, with tactics such as increasing safety stock and implementing dual-sourcing strategies.\nAt least in the midterm, improving the circularity of supply chains will further decrease Europe\u2019s dependence on raw materials and components from other regions while increasing sustainability. It could also increase the share of local added value in critical EV components and create additional jobs and economic growth. Our analysis shows that reusing materials from scrapped batteries can also save up to 10 percent of costs and avoid 20 percent of the CO2 required in production. To implement a circular value chain, industry stakeholders would need to commit to the use of recycled content and material efficiency and establish reverse operations at end of life.\nEnd-to-end transparency on ESG criteria such as digital traceability is an important way to make critical supply chains more sustainable. As sustainability standards in key industries begin to develop\u2014consider the launch of the battery passport, which contains ESG data for batteries23\u201cAction partnerships: Battery passport,\u201d Global Battery Alliance, accessed August 15, 2023.\u2014the European auto industry should stay at the forefront of ESG performance to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the future.\nHyperscale competitive European battery and semiconductor players\nWe\u2019ve observed that European players are underrepresented in battery manufacturing and high-end compute and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence. According to our analysis, only one European manufacturer is among the top ten in terms of market capitalization for battery manufacturing, while in semiconductors, Europe needs to close the capability gap for the next wave of computing to deliver functionalities such as ADAS.\nA path to creating an ecosystem of technology champions consists of three elements. First, Europe should consider developing a pan-European regulatory rule book to scale high-growth firms, aligning tax standards, regulations, labor rules, and bureaucratic processes. Second, to stay at the forefront of technology, the region would need to build specialized knowledge and product innovation capabilities. Suppliers could tap into niche specialties, such as more-sustainable battery refining. Finally, the European industry would need a battery and semiconductor network, similar to the one that serves the aerospace industry. European incumbents could form strategic partnerships with emerging entrants and research institutions.\nDesign a way forward for ADAS with policy support\nAdvanced driver assistance systems features are increasingly important. They are becoming a key differentiator for vehicle buyers: According to our research, 51 percent of consumers worldwide would consider switching to some form of ADAS car in the future. Competitive pressures around ADAS are also intensifying. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz was the first automotive player to introduce and certify Level 3 autonomy, the threshold at which drivers can take their hands off the wheel.24Andrew J. Hawkins, \u201cMercedes-Benz is the first to bring Level 3 automated driving to the US,\u201d Verge, January 27, 2023. Other participants in the global industry are catching up using a variety of technology approaches.\nTo remain competitive, the European industry may need to form a cross-industry alliance. Players could collaborate in two main areas. The first area is where differentiation is negligible and where there are opportunities for savings. This would include standardizing sensor communication protocols, which would simplify the integration of new sensors. Standardizing middleware (which sits between front- and back-end technologies) and layers of the operating system are other approaches.\nThe second area of collaboration is where scale and large databases could enable a faster, more robust development process for efforts including the continuous updates of software layers in maps\u2014updates such as creating high-definition map- and location-based services. A shared pool of data could also be used for AI training and validation.\nThe right regulatory environment could be critical to enable this kind of cross-industry collaboration. Public-sector stakeholders could consider adapting existing guidelines to the context of autonomous driving. These updates could encourage collaborative precompetitive research and innovation that advance and accelerate technological progress and drive standardization.\nClose the software skill gap to win the automotive digital transition\nSoftware is essential to the future of the automotive industry. But according to our analysis, only 15 to 20 percent of current R&D workers at European incumbents have software skills, compared with almost 45 percent at new entrants.\nTo shrink the gap, industry stakeholders would need to find holistic solutions. For example, European incumbents could create shared\u2014or at least interoperable\u2014software platforms across OEMs in Europe (and possibly other regions where the industry has strong partnerships) to complement individual participants\u2019 capabilities and to avoid costly solo efforts.\nEarly hiring, reskilling, and foreign talent can also help close the gap. Players can intensify early hiring directly from universities and boost STEM and software talent education through partnerships with universities and schools. Our research shows that reskilling is already in progress: 37 percent of European suppliers have ongoing reskilling efforts, and another 41 percent have plans to implement them. To draw skilled software talent from other regions, European employers would need accelerate processes around work permits and accommodate foreign talent\u2019s requirements on salary, benefits, and working conditions.\nCreating an environment that enables accelerated progress\nAbout the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility\nThese insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobility\u2014from consumer needs to modal mix across urban/rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. Contact us if you are interested in getting full access to our market insights via the McKinsey Mobility Insights Portal.\nEuropean automotive players are moving in the right direction but should consider scaling and accelerating their efforts. To accomplish this, a wide variety of stakeholders in the region would need to create an environment that breeds progress and future wins for the region\u2019s automotive industry. The formula requires a road map, catalysts, and platforms for cooperation.\nA clear road map such as the one we outline is needed to help accelerate the European automotive industry\u2019s progress. Its seven pillars would need to be converted into actionable measures and quantifiable targets for industry stakeholders\u2014suppliers, OEMs, players from adjacent industries, and regulatory bodies. Associations could take on a coordinating role.\nCatalysts play a significant role in implementing the road map. One is a competitive regulatory environment. Clearly defining and communicating common standards and codifying interoperability across all elements of the road map is likely to be critical.\nAnother critical catalyst of the European industry\u2019s transition is EV infrastructure. According to our analysis, the industry will need a cumulative \u20ac300 billion worth of infrastructure investments in electricity generation, the electricity grid, EV chargers, and hydrogen refueling systems through 2030.25European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. European stakeholders have begun to install public chargers at a pace of 2,000 charging points per week.26European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. But to meet demand, decision makers would need to build out charging infrastructure to the tune of 6,000 to 14,000 charging points per week.27European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. We found that the wind and solar assets required to fulfill the corresponding demand for energy with renewable sources would require four times as many workers in Europe by 2030 than are currently available.\nFinally, the industry would need platforms for collaboration. As industry boundaries are redefined, three kinds of partnership will become more important: horizontal partnerships between entities in the same parts of the value chain (such as multiple car companies) for efforts such as software development or to gain a solid footing in the Chinese market; vertical partnerships between entities in different parts of the value chain (such as car companies with tech companies) to secure access to technology and talent; and cross-industry partnerships, such as collaborations between automotive players and utilities to facilitate structural goals such as seamless sector coupling.\nOur road map shows a way forward for a globally competitive European auto industry. The work will require action from an expansive array of regional stakeholders and a supportive administrative environment. Time is of the essence.\nAndreas Cornet and Andreas Tschiesner are senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Munich office, where Patrick Schaufuss is a partner; Ruth Heuss is a senior partner in the Berlin office.\nThe authors wish to thank Ondrej Burkacky, Julian Conzade, Johannes Deichmann, Lauritz Fischer, Maximilian Geirhos, Marco Groth, Volker Gr\u00fcntges, Antonia Gutzler, Martin Hattrup-Silberberg, Martin Kellner, Martin Linder, Nicoline L\u00fchrs, Lukas Michor, Jan Paulitschek, and Kirsten Weerda for their contributions to this report.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nEnergy Indicators\nMarch 13, 2024\nCoal power usage continues to decline in Texas. Solar power  will be roughly half of all new electric-generation additions in both Texas and  the U.S. in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Weatherization  over the last couple of years has significantly improved grid stability in  Texas. Global electric vehicle (EV) sales grew in 2023, with China accounting  for over half of those sales. In the U.S., the West Coast dominated EV  purchases last year. Finally, global CO2 emissions rose in 2023,  largely driven by coal use in China and India.\u00a0 \nElectrical demand\nCoal power down; wind power up \nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas\u2019 (ERCOT) net power  generation rose from 429 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to 444 TWh in 2023 (Chart  1). Among lower-carbon  power sources, generation from nuclear plants has been hovering around 40  TWh since 2007, while wind and solar output rose by 99 TWh during the same time  frame. Utility-scale solar generation swelled to 32 TWh in 2023 from zero in  2015.\n\nNatural gas made up 47 percent of the 290 TWh of thermal  generation (coal, natural gas and nuclear) in 2007; coal was 39 percent. In  2023, natural gas provided 66 percent of the 303 TWh of thermal power, and coal  was 20 percent. \nSolar power capacity growth to outpace other sources\nAbout half of new U.S. planned grid additions will come from  solar power in 2024, according to the EIA (Chart 2). A total of 55.8 gigawatts  (GW) of name-plate generation capacity will be added in 2024, including 26.4 GW  of solar (47 percent), 13.4 GW of wind (24 percent) and 8.2 GW of battery  storage (15 percent). Solar will see more than half of its new capacity in  three states: Texas, California and Florida.\n\nNatural gas\u00ad will add 7.5 GW (13 percent of new generation  capacity) to the grid. This will be the lowest new natural gas capacity in 25  years. In addition, 4.7 GW of coal and natural gas capacity is expected to be  retired nationwide in 2024.\nHowever, due to the intermittent nature of renewables like  wind and solar and variations in demand for thermal power over the course of  the day and year, total output potential from these sources will be much less  than the total capacity. In 2023, installed utility-scale solar capacity was  690 TWh, while generation was only 162 TWh. The ratio of the two\u2014the capacity  factor\u2014was 23 percent in 2023 and 34 percent for wind. The average capacity  factor for natural gas was 41 percent.\nHalf of Texas\u2019 new generation capacity in 2024 will be  solar, matching that of the U.S.\u2019 Already a global leader in wind-power  production, wind will only make up 10 percent of the state\u2019s additions versus  24 percent nationally. Texas will also see the addition of 3.5 GW of natural-gas-fired  turbines, nearly half that of the nation. Most of these gas plants are peakers\u2014turbines  optimized to flex up and down when demand spikes or when output from other  sources like intermittent renewables or less reliable older coal and gas plants  (1.7 GW of which are slated for retirement this year) is unable to meet demand.\nFor the first time, Texas is also recruiting a material volume  of battery storage capacity to join peaker plants in balancing the Texas grid. Over  one-third of all U.S. utility-scale battery storage installations this year  will be in Texas, adding 3 GW of dispatchable power to the state. Combined with  new gas-fired units and other efforts to ensure sufficient capacity during severe  weather conditions, this should help mitigate some of the state\u2019s recent challenges  regarding grid stability.\nThermal outages less severe in recent winter blast\nDuring the most recent winter storm in Texas, Winter Storm  Heather, thermal outages were only 4.3 GW when temperatures hit their coldest  on Jan. 15, compared with 7.1 GW on Dec. 23, 2022, the previous Texas cold  front, Winter Storm Elliot (Chart 3). Thermal outages are forced  resource outages at gas, coal and nuclear power plants for unexpected  malfunctions or quick repairs and maintenance.\n\nThe lower outages were due in part to changes made by the state  legislature after the catastrophic Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Measures  that helped included requiring weatherization of power generation facilities,  ensuring power was prioritized for critical energy infrastructure like oil and  natural gas field operations and pipelines, and enhanced communication between  different Texas agencies. \nBattery Electric Vehicles (BEV)\nElectric car sales growing\nOne increasing source of electrical demand is electric  vehicles. Global EV sales increased from 10.3 million in 2022 to 13.6 million  in 2023, a 32 percent increase (Chart 4). The U.S. saw the largest  percent increase (60 percent), increasing from 1 million to 1.6 million cars  sold. \n\nOn a monthly basis though, EV sales were down 70 percent  from January to December 2023, reflecting subsidy cuts in Germany and France  and lower demand in China. Germany announced the termination of its BEV subsidy  of up to $4,878 to help mitigate the nation\u2019s budget deficit. The French  government cut a subsidy for purchasing EV and hybrid vehicles for higher-income  buyers by 20 percent. \nMarket penetration has been more limited in the U.S. versus Europe and China. In 2023, 25 percent of all cars sold in China were EVs, 22 percent were in the European Union and 9 percent were in the U.S. In the first six months of 2023, the average retail EV price in China was $33,000, while in the U.S. it was $72,000. In Europe, the average price of an EV is similar to that in the U.S. at $71,000, but EV buyers in Europe enjoy many benefits such as lower registration taxes, exemptions from tolls and congestion charges, and subsidies for home-charging installation.\nWest Coast leads U.S. in EV sales \nDuring the first three quarters of 2023, 26 percent of all  vehicle sales in California were EVs, while only 1 percent of sales in North  Dakota were (Chart 5). Texas\u2019 sales came in at 6 percent of the market,  3 percent below the national average. Washington saw the greatest increase in  EV market share year over year, with a 7.6 percent increase in September 2023.  Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia increased their EV market share  by 2 percent or more from third quarter 2022 to third quarter 2023. \n\nGlobal emissions\nIn 2023, a net decline in global CO2 emissions  from combustion of 411 metric tons in the U.S. and European Union was offset by  an increase of 736 metric tons in China and India (Chart 6). In advanced  economies, emissions fell by 4.5 percent, driven by growth in renewables and  increases in energy-efficiency measures. \n\nQuestions can be addressed to Kenya Schott at kenya.schott@dal.frb.org.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The European automotive industry is a significant contributor to the region's economy, accounting for nearly 7% of GDP and employing around 14 million people. However, it faces challenges such as the shift to electrified powertrains, software differentiation, and competition from new entrants, particularly from China. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports, with 3.0 million vehicles compared to Germany's 2.6 million. Rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions further complicate the industry's landscape.The industry has historically been a hub of innovation, with 30% of global automotive patents originating from Europe. Investments in R&D have led to advancements in sustainability and safety. The brand value of the top ten European auto companies is estimated at \u20ac200 billion, with five of the ten most valuable car brands being European.Despite these strengths, the industry is undergoing significant disruptions. European OEMs have lost market share to Chinese competitors, particularly in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The transition to EVs is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80% annually since 2020. European OEMs have announced plans to launch over 150 EV models by 2030.The shift to software-defined vehicles is also crucial, with semiconductors and batteries becoming key components. European suppliers need to adapt to this change, as modern vehicles may have up to 150 control units. The industry must also address supply chain challenges, particularly in batteries and semiconductors, to remain competitive.Macroeconomic challenges such as high energy costs, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a productivity crisis further impact the industry. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe are twice those in the U.S. and triple those in China, affecting production costs.To navigate these challenges, a road map with seven pillars is proposed: understanding customer needs, focusing on cost and speed, executing a winning strategy for the Chinese market, creating resilient supply chains, developing competitive battery and semiconductor players, advancing ADAS with policy support, and closing the software skill gap.European OEMs need to localize R&D and production in China, develop products tailored to Chinese consumers, and form strategic partnerships. Resilient supply chains require localization, circularity, and sustainability. The industry needs significant investments in battery and semiconductor manufacturing to meet future demand.Collaboration across the industry and with adjacent sectors is essential. A competitive regulatory environment and substantial investments in EV infrastructure are critical. The industry must also focus on software skills, with only 15-20% of current R&D workers having software expertise compared to 45% at new entrants.In summary, the European automotive industry must act swiftly and collaboratively to maintain its global competitiveness in the face of profound changes and challenges.",

Weatherization over the last couple of years has significantly improved grid stability in Texas. Global electric vehicle (EV) sales grew in 2023, with China accounting for over half of those sales. In the U.S., the West Coast dominated EV purchases last year. Finally, global CO2 emissions rose in 2023, largely driven by coal use in China and India. Electrical demand Coal power down; wind power up The Electric Reliability Council of Texas\u2019 (ERCOT) net power generation rose from 429 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to 444 TWh in 2023 (Chart 1). Among lower-carbon power sources, generation from nuclear plants has been hovering around 40 TWh since 2007, while wind and solar output rose by 99 TWh during the same time frame. Utility-scale solar generation swelled to 32 TWh in 2023 from zero in 2015. Natural gas made up 47 percent of the 290 TWh of thermal generation (coal, natural gas and nuclear) in 2007; coal was 39 percent. In 2023, natural gas provided 66 percent of the 303 TWh of thermal power, and coal was 20 percent. Solar power capacity growth to outpace other sources About half of new U.S. planned grid additions will come from solar power in 2024, according to the EIA (Chart 2). A total of 55.8 gigawatts (GW) of name-plate generation capacity will be added in 2024, including 26.4 GW of solar (47 percent), 13.4 GW of wind (24 percent) and 8.2 GW of battery storage (15 percent). Solar will see more than half of its new capacity in three states: Texas, California and Florida. Natural gas\u00ad will add 7.5 GW (13 percent of new generation capacity) to the grid. This will be the lowest new natural gas capacity in 25 years. In addition, 4.7 GW of coal and natural gas capacity is expected to be retired nationwide in 2024. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewables like wind and solar and variations in demand for thermal power over the course of the day and year, total output potential from these sources will be much less than the total capacity. In 2023, installed utility-scale solar capacity was 690 TWh, while generation was only 162 TWh. The ratio of the two\u2014the capacity factor\u2014was 23 percent in 2023 and 34 percent for wind. The average capacity factor for natural gas was 41 percent. Half of Texas\u2019 new generation capacity in 2024 will be solar, matching that of the U.S.\u2019 Already a global leader in wind-power production, wind will only make up 10 percent of the state\u2019s additions versus 24 percent nationally. Texas will also see the addition of 3.5 GW of natural-gas-fired turbines, nearly half that of the nation. Most of these gas plants are peakers\u2014turbines optimized to flex up and down when demand spikes or when output from other sources like intermittent renewables or less reliable older coal and gas plants (1.7 GW of which are slated for retirement this year) is unable to meet demand. For the first time, Texas is also recruiting a material volume of battery storage capacity to join peaker plants in balancing the Texas grid. Over one-third of all U.S. utility-scale battery storage installations this year will be in Texas, adding 3 GW of dispatchable power to the state. Combined with new gas-fired units and other efforts to ensure sufficient capacity during severe weather conditions, this should help mitigate some of the state\u2019s recent challenges regarding grid stability. Thermal outages less severe in recent winter blast During the most recent winter storm in Texas, Winter Storm Heather, thermal outages were only 4.3 GW when temperatures hit their coldest on Jan. 15, compared with 7.1 GW on Dec. 23, 2022, the previous Texas cold front, Winter Storm Elliot (Chart 3). Thermal outages are forced resource outages at gas, coal and nuclear power plants for unexpected malfunctions or quick repairs and maintenance. The lower outages were due in part to changes made by the state legislature after the catastrophic Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Measures that helped included requiring weatherization of power generation facilities, ensuring power was prioritized for critical energy infrastructure like oil and natural gas field operations and pipelines, and enhanced communication between different Texas agencies. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) Electric car sales growing One increasing source of electrical demand is electric vehicles. Global EV sales increased from 10.3 million in 2022 to 13.6 million in 2023, a 32 percent increase (Chart 4). The U.S. saw the largest percent increase (60 percent), increasing from 1 million to 1.6 million cars sold. On a monthly basis though, EV sales were down 70 percent from January to December 2023, reflecting subsidy cuts in Germany and France and lower demand in China. Germany announced the termination of its BEV subsidy of up to $4,878 to help mitigate the nation\u2019s budget deficit. The French government cut a subsidy for purchasing EV and hybrid vehicles for higher-income buyers by 20 percent. Market penetration has been more limited in the U.S. versus Europe and China. In 2023, 25 percent of all cars sold in China were EVs, 22 percent were in the European Union and 9 percent were in the U.S. In the first six months of 2023, the average retail EV price in China was $33,000, while in the U.S. it was $72,000. In Europe, the average price of an EV is similar to that in the U.S. at $71,000, but EV buyers in Europe enjoy many benefits such as lower registration taxes, exemptions from tolls and congestion charges, and subsidies for home-charging installation. West Coast leads U.S. in EV sales During the first three quarters of 2023, 26 percent of all vehicle sales in California were EVs, while only 1 percent of sales in North Dakota were (Chart 5). Texas\u2019 sales came in at 6 percent of the market, 3 percent below the national average. Washington saw the greatest increase in EV market share year over year, with a 7.6 percent increase in September 2023. Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia increased their EV market share by 2 percent or more from third quarter 2022 to third quarter 2023. Global emissions In 2023, a net decline in global CO2 emissions from combustion of 411 metric tons in the U.S. and European Union was offset by an increase of 736 metric tons in China and India (Chart 6). In advanced economies, emissions fell by 4.5 percent, driven by growth in renewables and increases in energy-efficiency measures.

Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n$29.99 /\u00c2\u00a030\u00c2\u00a0days\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nThe economic commitment of climate change\nSystematic review and meta-analysis of ex-post evaluations on the effectiveness of carbon pricing\nThe refinery of the future\nData availability\nThe individual hourly cooling behaviour data can be obtained from Ecobee upon request38.

Data is from the second half of 2023.\nCosts and trends in Arizona\nAccording to EnergySage, the average home solar power system size in Arizona at the end of 2023 was 12.4kW. A greater reliance on air conditioning results in higher average household electricity use in Arizona than in some parts of the country, requiring slightly larger solar systems than the national average of 11.6kW. \nHowever, the low cost per watt of Arizona solar makes systems there cost-effective. The federal solar tax credit can reduce the upfront cost for solar by as much as 30%, bringing the typical cost down to $19,898. State incentives can further lower the cost.\nThe average payback period for a solar system in Arizona is 11 years, according to June 2024 data from EnergySage, with 20-year savings on an average system estimated at $19,628. Solar costs in Arizona, already the lowest in the nation per watt, have been trending down, dropping by 2% between the first and second half of 2023, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar & Storage Marketplace Report 2023.View all sources \n\u00bb MORE: Best solar companies\nState incentives and policy in Arizona\nAs in many states, the biggest solar incentive for Arizona homeowners is the federal solar tax credit, or residential clean energy credit, which provides a credit of up to 30% of the cost of your solar power system. \nState incentives\nOn the state level, Arizona encouraged solar installations with policies like the 2006 Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, which required Arizona utilities to source 15% of their energy from renewable sources. Of that amount, 30% was required to come from distributed sources like rooftop solar. \nOver time, many of these incentives have been phased out as rooftop solar adoption has increased in the state, and new fees have been imposed on solar customers. But Arizonans can still benefit from certain incentives and protections:\nIn addition to the federal solar tax credit, the Arizona Solar Energy Credit provides a credit of 25% of the cost of a solar system on your state income tax bill, up to a $1,000 maximum.

Solar Energy Devices.View all sources \nYou can find more local benefits on the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE), a project maintained by the North Carolina State University.\nNet metering\nAs part of a trend across the nation, Arizona\u2019s net metering (NEM) program, which gave solar customers credit on their electric bill for any unused electricity their system sent back to the power grid, has been phased out. In 2016 the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC), which regulates many of the utilities in the state, replaced Arizona\u2019s NEM program with a net billing program known as the Resource Comparison Proxy (RCP). \nThe RCP compensates solar customers at a lower rate than NEM did for excess power they send to the grid, under a tiered step-down that can go down up to 10% per year, eventually arriving at the \u201cavoided cost\u201d rate, according to Autumn T. Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association (AriSEIA). The avoided cost rate is much lower than the retail rate of electricity, representing the cost a utility avoids by using solar customers\u2019 excess solar instead of producing that electricity themselves or purchasing it elsewhere. \nEach utility does its own avoided cost calculation, so your RCP export rate will depend on your utility. As of September 2023, the export rates for Arizona Public Service and Tucson Electric Power were 7.619 cents/kWh and 6.33 cents/kWh, respectively. But Salt River Project, a large utility that is not regulated by the ACC, was able to drop the export rate dramatically to 2.81 cents/kWh. \n\u201cGiven the current RCP structure, it\u2019s better to go solar sooner rather than later, because the longer you wait, the lower the export rate is,\u201d says Johnson. \nEnergy storage in Arizona\nHome solar batteries cost an average of $8,526 in Arizona after the federal tax credit, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar battery cost: Why they're not always worth it.View all sources But they can be well worth the cost, especially in Arizona:\nBatteries improve the economics of home solar under net billing because instead of sending excess energy back to the grid at a lower credit, you can store the energy to use later.\nMost Arizona solar customers are required to be on a time-of-use (TOU) electricity rate, under which electricity rates are lower at times of low demand and higher at times of high demand. You may use more electricity in your home when you return home from work, demand is high, and the sun is going down so your panels are generating less electricity. A battery can lower your costs by storing the electricity your panels generate during the day for your use in the evening.\nSome of the TOU rate plans in Arizona include demand charges, which are based on spikes in your energy demand. Your home could be using a relatively small amount of energy, but spikes during these times can increase your electricity bill dramatically. As with TOU rates, batteries can lower demand charges significantly by storing electricity that you can use during peak use times.\nWith more heat waves straining the power grid, batteries provide reliable energy backup. Solar alone won\u2019t keep your home powered during an outage, because systems are designed to shut off if there\u2019s an outage to ensure the safety of utility workers.\nLike solar costs, battery costs are expected to keep falling, and technologies are constantly improving. Arizona is beginning to offer residential customers demand response programs, which help avoid strain on the power grid by incentivizing customers to shift their energy use to times when demand is lower. With a home solar battery, you can get the most out of these programs. \nRead more about solar panel costs, incentives and policies in these states:\nCalifornia\nTexas\nFlorida\nColorado\nNorth Carolina\nLouisiana\nCan I get financing for a solar panel system?\nIn addition to tax incentives and rebates, there are options available. Many solar installers offer financing, but you may also be able to finance your solar investment through a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). These options may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.\nHome equity loans and HELOCs are ways to borrow against the value of your home, converting equity into cash. With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically from five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You\u2019ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.\nFigure: NMLS#1717824\nBetter: NMLS#330511\nQuicken Loans: NMLS#3030\n85%\n90%\n90%\n640\n680\n680\nNational\nNational\nNational\n\u00bb COMPARE: Pros and cons of home equity loans and HELOCs\nAnother option is a solar loan. Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer these to fund solar panels and installation, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000, and annual percentage rates ranging from 6% to 36%. They function like a personal loan: you receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. And unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral required for a solar loan. This means your home or solar panels aren\u2019t at risk if you miss payments, but you may have to pay late fees.\nSo, yes, you likely can get financing. If you go this route, compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing package that a solar provider may offer you to ensure you get the best deal.\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, you can contact local solar installers and get free quotes; it\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare, and Solar United Neighbors can help you do the comparison. Installers will start by looking at your electric bill and an online view of your house to get you an initial quote, before making a site visit to check things like the condition of your roof.\nUnder net metering, or NEM, the solar-generated electricity you send back to the grid is compensated at a retail rate. Under net billing, referred to in Arizona as RCP, the electricity you send back to the grid is compensated at a lower rate \u2014 in some cases the avoided cost rate, or the value of that electricity to the grid at the time when it goes back to the grid. Your system will usually send the most electricity to the grid during the middle of the day, when demand is lower. That means that under the avoided cost rate, it will be considered lower-value and credited at a much lower rate than it would have been under NEM.\nYes. If energy storage isn\u2019t right for you at the moment, you can still go solar now and add a battery later when costs come down. Unlike solar, energy storage will not be affected by future cuts to Arizona\u2019s RCP net billing export rate.\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, you can contact local solar installers and get free quotes; it\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare, and Solar United Neighbors can help you do the comparison.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Climate change will impact the value and optimal adoption of residential rooftop solar. Rooftop solar adoption is critical for residential decarbonization and hinges on its value to households. Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.",

Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n$29.99 /\u00c2\u00a030\u00c2\u00a0days\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nThe economic commitment of climate change\nSystematic review and meta-analysis of ex-post evaluations on the effectiveness of carbon pricing\nThe refinery of the future\nData availability\nThe individual hourly cooling behaviour data can be obtained from Ecobee upon request38.

Data is from the second half of 2023.\nCosts and trends in Arizona\nAccording to EnergySage, the average home solar power system size in Arizona at the end of 2023 was 12.4kW. A greater reliance on air conditioning results in higher average household electricity use in Arizona than in some parts of the country, requiring slightly larger solar systems than the national average of 11.6kW. \nHowever, the low cost per watt of Arizona solar makes systems there cost-effective. The federal solar tax credit can reduce the upfront cost for solar by as much as 30%, bringing the typical cost down to $19,898. State incentives can further lower the cost.\nThe average payback period for a solar system in Arizona is 11 years, according to June 2024 data from EnergySage, with 20-year savings on an average system estimated at $19,628. Solar costs in Arizona, already the lowest in the nation per watt, have been trending down, dropping by 2% between the first and second half of 2023, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar & Storage Marketplace Report 2023.View all sources \n\u00bb MORE: Best solar companies\nState incentives and policy in Arizona\nAs in many states, the biggest solar incentive for Arizona homeowners is the federal solar tax credit, or residential clean energy credit, which provides a credit of up to 30% of the cost of your solar power system. \nState incentives\nOn the state level, Arizona encouraged solar installations with policies like the 2006 Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, which required Arizona utilities to source 15% of their energy from renewable sources. Of that amount, 30% was required to come from distributed sources like rooftop solar. \nOver time, many of these incentives have been phased out as rooftop solar adoption has increased in the state, and new fees have been imposed on solar customers. But Arizonans can still benefit from certain incentives and protections:\nIn addition to the federal solar tax credit, the Arizona Solar Energy Credit provides a credit of 25% of the cost of a solar system on your state income tax bill, up to a $1,000 maximum.

Solar Energy Devices.View all sources \nYou can find more local benefits on the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE), a project maintained by the North Carolina State University.\nNet metering\nAs part of a trend across the nation, Arizona\u2019s net metering (NEM) program, which gave solar customers credit on their electric bill for any unused electricity their system sent back to the power grid, has been phased out. In 2016 the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC), which regulates many of the utilities in the state, replaced Arizona\u2019s NEM program with a net billing program known as the Resource Comparison Proxy (RCP). \nThe RCP compensates solar customers at a lower rate than NEM did for excess power they send to the grid, under a tiered step-down that can go down up to 10% per year, eventually arriving at the \u201cavoided cost\u201d rate, according to Autumn T. Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association (AriSEIA). The avoided cost rate is much lower than the retail rate of electricity, representing the cost a utility avoids by using solar customers\u2019 excess solar instead of producing that electricity themselves or purchasing it elsewhere. \nEach utility does its own avoided cost calculation, so your RCP export rate will depend on your utility. As of September 2023, the export rates for Arizona Public Service and Tucson Electric Power were 7.619 cents/kWh and 6.33 cents/kWh, respectively. But Salt River Project, a large utility that is not regulated by the ACC, was able to drop the export rate dramatically to 2.81 cents/kWh. \n\u201cGiven the current RCP structure, it\u2019s better to go solar sooner rather than later, because the longer you wait, the lower the export rate is,\u201d says Johnson. \nEnergy storage in Arizona\nHome solar batteries cost an average of $8,526 in Arizona after the federal tax credit, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar battery cost: Why they're not always worth it.View all sources But they can be well worth the cost, especially in Arizona:\nBatteries improve the economics of home solar under net billing because instead of sending excess energy back to the grid at a lower credit, you can store the energy to use later.\nMost Arizona solar customers are required to be on a time-of-use (TOU) electricity rate, under which electricity rates are lower at times of low demand and higher at times of high demand. You may use more electricity in your home when you return home from work, demand is high, and the sun is going down so your panels are generating less electricity. A battery can lower your costs by storing the electricity your panels generate during the day for your use in the evening.\nSome of the TOU rate plans in Arizona include demand charges, which are based on spikes in your energy demand. Your home could be using a relatively small amount of energy, but spikes during these times can increase your electricity bill dramatically. As with TOU rates, batteries can lower demand charges significantly by storing electricity that you can use during peak use times.\nWith more heat waves straining the power grid, batteries provide reliable energy backup. Solar alone won\u2019t keep your home powered during an outage, because systems are designed to shut off if there\u2019s an outage to ensure the safety of utility workers.\nLike solar costs, battery costs are expected to keep falling, and technologies are constantly improving. Arizona is beginning to offer residential customers demand response programs, which help avoid strain on the power grid by incentivizing customers to shift their energy use to times when demand is lower. With a home solar battery, you can get the most out of these programs. \nRead more about solar panel costs, incentives and policies in these states:\nCalifornia\nTexas\nFlorida\nColorado\nNorth Carolina\nLouisiana\nCan I get financing for a solar panel system?\nIn addition to tax incentives and rebates, there are options available. Many solar installers offer financing, but you may also be able to finance your solar investment through a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). These options may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.\nHome equity loans and HELOCs are ways to borrow against the value of your home, converting equity into cash. With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically from five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You\u2019ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.\nFigure: NMLS#1717824\nBetter: NMLS#330511\nQuicken Loans: NMLS#3030\n85%\n90%\n90%\n640\n680\n680\nNational\nNational\nNational\n\u00bb COMPARE: Pros and cons of home equity loans and HELOCs\nAnother option is a solar loan. Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer these to fund solar panels and installation, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000, and annual percentage rates ranging from 6% to 36%. They function like a personal loan: you receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. And unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral required for a solar loan. This means your home or solar panels aren\u2019t at risk if you miss payments, but you may have to pay late fees.\nSo, yes, you likely can get financing. If you go this route, compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing package that a solar provider may offer you to ensure you get the best deal.\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, you can contact local solar installers and get free quotes; it\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare, and Solar United Neighbors can help you do the comparison. Installers will start by looking at your electric bill and an online view of your house to get you an initial quote, before making a site visit to check things like the condition of your roof.\nUnder net metering, or NEM, the solar-generated electricity you send back to the grid is compensated at a retail rate. Under net billing, referred to in Arizona as RCP, the electricity you send back to the grid is compensated at a lower rate \u2014 in some cases the avoided cost rate, or the value of that electricity to the grid at the time when it goes back to the grid. Your system will usually send the most electricity to the grid during the middle of the day, when demand is lower. That means that under the avoided cost rate, it will be considered lower-value and credited at a much lower rate than it would have been under NEM.\nYes. If energy storage isn\u2019t right for you at the moment, you can still go solar now and add a battery later when costs come down. Unlike solar, energy storage will not be affected by future cuts to Arizona\u2019s RCP net billing export rate.\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, you can contact local solar installers and get free quotes; it\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare, and Solar United Neighbors can help you do the comparison.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Climate change will impact the value and optimal adoption of residential rooftop solar. Rooftop solar adoption is critical for residential decarbonization and hinges on its value to households. Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.",

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago.

    "Document2": "Watch CBS News\nGet Ready For Higher Electric Bills, Regulators Sign Off On FPL Rate Increases\n\nOctober 26, 2021 / 11:37 PM EDT\n          / CBS Miami\n        \nTALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/NSF) - State utility regulators Tuesday approved a series of base-rate increases for Florida Power & Light that will result in higher monthly bills for customers in January.\nDespite opponents' arguments that residential and small business customers will end up subsidizing costs for some larger customers, the Public Service Commission unanimously supported a four-year rate settlement, which calls for a $692 million increase in base rates in January and another increase of $560 million in 2023. Additional increases are planned in 2024 and 2025 to pay for solar projects.\nCommission Chairman Gary Clark noted receiving more than 1,100 emails from consumers about the proposal and indicated he had concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and a electric-vehicle charging station program. But, Clark said he understands the need for clean energy investments and pointed to other benefits of the settlement, such as predictability in rates.\n\"There are things within that predictability that I think give homeowners, give businesses some assurity going into the future, that they have a stable rate climate, they can do their budgeting accordingly,\" Clark said. \"I think that is a very positive, very positive thing.\"\nCommissioners also added a requirement for annual reports on the company's expansion of infrastructure for electric vehicles.\nFPL reached the rate settlement in August with the state Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Three other parties later signed on.\nThe rate plan incorporates the merger of FPL and Northwest Florida's Gulf Power. That merger formally took effect Jan. 1, but it came with issues such as the utilities having widely different rates.\nIn a prepared statement, FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy said the deal benefits all customers by keeping \"bills low\" while \"accelerating investments in clean energy.\"\n\"Florida is a rapidly growing state on the front lines of climate change, and our customers deserve bold, decisive, long-term actions as we continue building a more resilient and sustainable energy future all of us can depend on, including future generations,\" Silagy said in the statement.\nFor customers outside of Northwest Florida who use 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month, bills are expected to go from the current $101.70 to $113.85 in January. Those bills would increase to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. In addition to base rates, the totals include costs for such things as natural gas for power plants.\nThe plan uses what is described as a \"transition rider\" to take into account the substantially different rates that FPL and Gulf have charged. The result will leave Northwest Florida customers paying more than FPL customers in other areas.\nUnder the plan, Gulf residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt hours a month will see their bills go from the current $129.24 to $137.49 in January. They then would see the bills decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024 and $126.47 in 2025.\nFPL filed a base-rate proposal in March and then negotiated the settlement, which trimmed the original proposal by about $428 million. The settlement, in part, reduced a targeted return on equity --- a closely watched measure of profitability --- from 11.5 percent to 10.6 percent.\n\"I believe that all of the parties are to be commended for the outstanding job that you did, negotiating on behalf of the folks that you represented,\" Clark said. \"It's pretty obvious some of you did a little better job than others.\"\nBut the settlement was opposed by Floridians Against Increased Rates, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising, which have members who are residential customers of FPL.\nThose groups argued, in part, that the plan will require residential and small business customers to subsidize the rates of large commercial and industrial customers.\n\"To put it succinctly, a settlement that includes so much wasteful spending to double down on fossil fuels, that transfers so much wealth from residential customers to commercial and industrial customers, and that literally leaves residential customers worse off than in FPL's original proposal, cannot be in the public interest,\" attorneys for the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising wrote in an Oct. 11 brief. \"This 'settlement' gives FPL everything they want --- and more.\"\nThe agreement addresses a series of solar-energy issues, which FPL said will support the development of 16 million solar panels at more than 50 sites across Florida. FPL has been operating under a base-rate settlement that took effect in January 2017 and will end in December.\n(\u00a92021 CBS Local Media. All rights reserved.

Despite concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and electric-vehicle charging station program, the settlement was seen as providing rate predictability. FPL's merger with Gulf Power, effective January 1, also influenced the rate plan. For customers using 1,000 kilowatt hours a month, bills will rise from $101.70 to $113.85 in January, then to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. Gulf residential customers will see their bills go from $129.24 to $137.49 in January, then decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024, and $126.47 in 2025. The settlement reduced FPL's targeted return on equity from 11.5% to 10.6%. The agreement also supports the development of 16 million solar panels at over 50 sites across Florida.",

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.  If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below.  The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA.  There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.\u00a0For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\nI have an Economics degree from\u00a0UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at\u00a0BNEF\u00a0and continue to work as a strategy consultant at\u00a0Maneas. \u00a0I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\nHello Lindsay,\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

    "Document2": "Watch CBS News\nGet Ready For Higher Electric Bills, Regulators Sign Off On FPL Rate Increases\n\nOctober 26, 2021 / 11:37 PM EDT\n          / CBS Miami\n        \nTALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/NSF) - State utility regulators Tuesday approved a series of base-rate increases for Florida Power & Light that will result in higher monthly bills for customers in January.\nDespite opponents' arguments that residential and small business customers will end up subsidizing costs for some larger customers, the Public Service Commission unanimously supported a four-year rate settlement, which calls for a $692 million increase in base rates in January and another increase of $560 million in 2023. Additional increases are planned in 2024 and 2025 to pay for solar projects.\nCommission Chairman Gary Clark noted receiving more than 1,100 emails from consumers about the proposal and indicated he had concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and a electric-vehicle charging station program. But, Clark said he understands the need for clean energy investments and pointed to other benefits of the settlement, such as predictability in rates.\n\"There are things within that predictability that I think give homeowners, give businesses some assurity going into the future, that they have a stable rate climate, they can do their budgeting accordingly,\" Clark said. \"I think that is a very positive, very positive thing.\"\nCommissioners also added a requirement for annual reports on the company's expansion of infrastructure for electric vehicles.\nFPL reached the rate settlement in August with the state Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Three other parties later signed on.\nThe rate plan incorporates the merger of FPL and Northwest Florida's Gulf Power. That merger formally took effect Jan. 1, but it came with issues such as the utilities having widely different rates.\nIn a prepared statement, FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy said the deal benefits all customers by keeping \"bills low\" while \"accelerating investments in clean energy.\"\n\"Florida is a rapidly growing state on the front lines of climate change, and our customers deserve bold, decisive, long-term actions as we continue building a more resilient and sustainable energy future all of us can depend on, including future generations,\" Silagy said in the statement.\nFor customers outside of Northwest Florida who use 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month, bills are expected to go from the current $101.70 to $113.85 in January. Those bills would increase to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. In addition to base rates, the totals include costs for such things as natural gas for power plants.\nThe plan uses what is described as a \"transition rider\" to take into account the substantially different rates that FPL and Gulf have charged. The result will leave Northwest Florida customers paying more than FPL customers in other areas.\nUnder the plan, Gulf residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt hours a month will see their bills go from the current $129.24 to $137.49 in January. They then would see the bills decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024 and $126.47 in 2025.\nFPL filed a base-rate proposal in March and then negotiated the settlement, which trimmed the original proposal by about $428 million. The settlement, in part, reduced a targeted return on equity --- a closely watched measure of profitability --- from 11.5 percent to 10.6 percent.\n\"I believe that all of the parties are to be commended for the outstanding job that you did, negotiating on behalf of the folks that you represented,\" Clark said. \"It's pretty obvious some of you did a little better job than others.\"\nBut the settlement was opposed by Floridians Against Increased Rates, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising, which have members who are residential customers of FPL.\nThose groups argued, in part, that the plan will require residential and small business customers to subsidize the rates of large commercial and industrial customers.\n\"To put it succinctly, a settlement that includes so much wasteful spending to double down on fossil fuels, that transfers so much wealth from residential customers to commercial and industrial customers, and that literally leaves residential customers worse off than in FPL's original proposal, cannot be in the public interest,\" attorneys for the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising wrote in an Oct. 11 brief. \"This 'settlement' gives FPL everything they want --- and more.\"\nThe agreement addresses a series of solar-energy issues, which FPL said will support the development of 16 million solar panels at more than 50 sites across Florida. FPL has been operating under a base-rate settlement that took effect in January 2017 and will end in December.\n(\u00a92021 CBS Local Media. All rights reserved.

What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much. Canada and United States really stand out. We included also the number of households. You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger. Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\n\nAcross the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\n\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. In India these are 66% and 5 respectively and in Nigeria 50% and 5. Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\n\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\n\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\n\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\n\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\n\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago.

    "Summarized_Document2": "State utility regulators approved a series of base-rate increases for Florida Power & Light (FPL) that will result in higher monthly bills for customers starting in January. The Public Service Commission supported a four-year rate settlement, which includes a $692 million increase in base rates in January and another $560 million increase in 2023. Additional increases are planned for 2024 and 2025 to fund solar projects. Despite concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and electric-vehicle charging station program, the settlement was seen as providing rate predictability. FPL's merger with Gulf Power, effective January 1, also influenced the rate plan. For customers using 1,000 kilowatt hours a month, bills will rise from $101.70 to $113.85 in January, then to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. Gulf residential customers will see their bills go from $129.24 to $137.49 in January, then decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024, and $126.47 in 2025. The settlement reduced FPL's targeted return on equity from 11.5% to 10.6%. The agreement also supports the development of 16 million solar panels at over 50 sites across Florida.",

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind.

The amount that you can save with solar in San Francisco, CA is based on two factors: how much you spend on electricity now and how much of your electric bill you can offset with solar.\nBased on the intensity and amount of sunlight hours in San Francisco, CA, the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA will need a 6.7 kilowatt (kW) solar panel system to offset 100% of their annual electricity consumption of 12,128 kWh per year. On the EnergySage Marketplace, solar shoppers in San Francisco, CA pay an average of $18,000 for a 6.7 kW solar panel system prior to\n            \n                incentives.\n            \n            \n\n                The savings from offsetting 100% of an electric bill with solar can add up fast!\n                Assuming an 5.9% annual increase in electricity prices and that you install your system with a $0-down loan,\n                you can expect to save $5,500 in your first year,\n                $30,800 over five years, $71,800 over 10 years,\n                and $199,200 over 20 years on electric bills in San Francisco, CA.\n                Over your system\u2019s lifetime you\u2019ll save more by financing your solar system with a cash purchase,\n                but you won\u2019t start saving in year one. Learn more about how to finance your solar panel system.\n\n\n                How much can you save by going solar in San Francisco, CA?\n            \nHow much can you save on electric bills with community solar in San Francisco, CA?\nEven if onsite solar doesn\u2019t make sense for you, you can still participate in the clean energy transition and save on your electric bills by subscribing to a community solar farm.\n                Community solar programs in San Francisco, CA\n                typically save you 5-15% in electricity costs over the course of the year. For the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA, 10% annual savings would amount to $547 in savings per year.\n\n                How much can you save by subscribing to a community solar farm in San Francisco, CA?\n            \nElectric bills in San Francisco, CA\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh.\nElectric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either\n                using less electricity\n                or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity.\nThe average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years!\nAssuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases.\nInstalling solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years.\n                Calculating your savings from investing in solar\n                is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment. When you sign up on the EnergySage Marketplace, you'll be able to receive and compare solar quotes side-by-side from qualified solar installers in your area.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Shrink That Footprint\n\nAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\n\nBy: Lindsay Wilson\n\nIntroduction \u2013 Electricity Used By A Home\n[Update 03/09/2024: we updated the average household electricity consumption figures using the latest data from EIA from 2023 which is current as of March 2024]\n\nAs of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year. This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day. Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.\n\nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\n\nWe use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures. The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding period.\n\nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10,204 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\n\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\n\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\n\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.\n\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\n\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\n\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\n\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\n\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\n\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh. We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\n\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\n\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\n\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\n\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\n\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. This figure increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\n\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.\n\nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023. This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it. Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d. What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much. Canada and United States really stand out. We included also the number of households. You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger. Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\n\nAcross the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\n\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. In India these are 66% and 5 respectively and in Nigeria 50% and 5. Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\n\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\n\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\n\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\n\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\n\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.

Thanks for all your research on energy. You may be interested on my company and my invention, patented and prototype only 10% fuel used. I have problems with marketing due to my small town in West Virginia.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.  If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below.  The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA.  There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.\u00a0For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\nI have an Economics degree from\u00a0UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at\u00a0BNEF\u00a0and continue to work as a strategy consultant at\u00a0Maneas. \u00a0I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\nHello Lindsay,\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

The amount that you can save with solar in San Francisco, CA is based on two factors: how much you spend on electricity now and how much of your electric bill you can offset with solar.\nBased on the intensity and amount of sunlight hours in San Francisco, CA, the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA will need a 6.7 kilowatt (kW) solar panel system to offset 100% of their annual electricity consumption of 12,128 kWh per year. On the EnergySage Marketplace, solar shoppers in San Francisco, CA pay an average of $18,000 for a 6.7 kW solar panel system prior to\n            \n                incentives.\n            \n            \n\n                The savings from offsetting 100% of an electric bill with solar can add up fast!\n                Assuming an 5.9% annual increase in electricity prices and that you install your system with a $0-down loan,\n                you can expect to save $5,500 in your first year,\n                $30,800 over five years, $71,800 over 10 years,\n                and $199,200 over 20 years on electric bills in San Francisco, CA.\n                Over your system\u2019s lifetime you\u2019ll save more by financing your solar system with a cash purchase,\n                but you won\u2019t start saving in year one. Learn more about how to finance your solar panel system.\n\n\n                How much can you save by going solar in San Francisco, CA?\n            \nHow much can you save on electric bills with community solar in San Francisco, CA?\nEven if onsite solar doesn\u2019t make sense for you, you can still participate in the clean energy transition and save on your electric bills by subscribing to a community solar farm.\n                Community solar programs in San Francisco, CA\n                typically save you 5-15% in electricity costs over the course of the year. For the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA, 10% annual savings would amount to $547 in savings per year.\n\n                How much can you save by subscribing to a community solar farm in San Francisco, CA?\n            \nElectric bills in San Francisco, CA\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh.\nElectric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either\n                using less electricity\n                or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity.\nThe average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years!\nAssuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases.\nInstalling solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years.\n                Calculating your savings from investing in solar\n                is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment. When you sign up on the EnergySage Marketplace, you'll be able to receive and compare solar quotes side-by-side from qualified solar installers in your area.

The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding period.\n\nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10,204 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\n\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\n\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\n\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.\n\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\n\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\n\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\n\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\n\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\n\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh. We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\n\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\n\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\n\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\n\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\n\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. This figure increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\n\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.\n\nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023. This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it. Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d. What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much. Canada and United States really stand out. We included also the number of households. You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger. Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\n\nAcross the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\n\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. In India these are 66% and 5 respectively and in Nigeria 50% and 5. Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\n\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\n\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\n\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\n\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\n\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

    "Summarized_Document2": "Cost of Electricity in San Francisco, CA\n\nWhy you can trust EnergySage\n\nThe data on this page comes from real solar quotes to real solar shoppers on the EnergySage Marketplace. We give you access to transparent information so you can confidently make informed energy decisions. Learn more about how our Marketplace works and how we make money.\n\nOn average, San Francisco, CA residents spend about $456 per month on electricity. That adds up to $5,472 per year. That\u2019s 88% higher than the national average electric bill of $2,914. The average electric rates in San Francisco, CA cost 45 \u00a2/kilowatt-hour (kWh), so that means that the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA is using 1,010 kWh of electricity per month, and 12,128 kWh over the course of the year.\n\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\n\nThis data is aggregated over the past 1 month.\n\nKey takeaways about electric rates in San Francisco, CA\n\nElectric bill savings with solar in San Francisco, CA\n\nSolar saves you money by reducing or eliminating your monthly electric bill. The amount that you can save with solar in San Francisco, CA is based on two factors: how much you spend on electricity now and how much of your electric bill you can offset with solar. Based on the intensity and amount of sunlight hours in San Francisco, CA, the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA will need a 6.7 kilowatt (kW) solar panel system to offset 100% of their annual electricity consumption of 12,128 kWh per year. On the EnergySage Marketplace, solar shoppers in San Francisco, CA pay an average of $18,000 for a 6.7 kW solar panel system prior to incentives.\n\nThe savings from offsetting 100% of an electric bill with solar can add up fast! Assuming a 5.9% annual increase in electricity prices and that you install your system with a $0-down loan, you can expect to save $5,500 in your first year, $30,800 over five years, $71,800 over 10 years, and $199,200 over 20 years on electric bills in San Francisco, CA. Over your system\u2019s lifetime you\u2019ll save more by financing your solar system with a cash purchase, but you won\u2019t start saving in year one. Learn more about how to finance your solar panel system.\n\nHow much can you save by going solar in San Francisco, CA?\n\nHow much can you save on electric bills with community solar in San Francisco, CA?\n\nEven if onsite solar doesn\u2019t make sense for you, you can still participate in the clean energy transition and save on your electric bills by subscribing to a community solar farm. Community solar programs in San Francisco, CA typically save you 5-15% in electricity costs over the course of the year. For the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA, 10% annual savings would amount to $547 in savings per year.\n\nHow much can you save by subscribing to a community solar farm in San Francisco, CA?\n\nElectric bills in San Francisco, CA\n\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh. Electric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either using less electricity or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\n\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\n\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\n\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\n\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years! Assuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases. Installing solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years. Calculating your savings from investing in solar is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\n\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\n\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment. When you sign up on the EnergySage Marketplace, you'll be able to receive and compare solar quotes side-by-side from qualified solar installers in your area. We're here to help along the way - talk with one of our Energy Advisors to learn more about your unique quotes, any local solar incentives you may be eligible for, or any other questions about saving on electric bills with solar.\n\nFrequently asked questions about electric rates and solar\n\nRecommended for You\n\nSolar panel buyer's guide\n\nCompare solar panels from leading brands\n\nCommunity solar\n\nSave money with renewable energy by subscribing to a community solar farm\n\nAll about solar\n\nLearn the basics of solar energy for your home so you can compare quotes with confidence\n\nCompare solar panels from leading brands\n\nSave money with renewable energy by subscribing to a community solar farm\n\nLearn the basics of solar energy for your home so you can compare quotes with confidence\n\nENERGYSAGE is a registered trademark and the EnergySage logo is a trademark of EnergySage, Inc.

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind.

The amount that you can save with solar in San Francisco, CA is based on two factors: how much you spend on electricity now and how much of your electric bill you can offset with solar.\nBased on the intensity and amount of sunlight hours in San Francisco, CA, the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA will need a 6.7 kilowatt (kW) solar panel system to offset 100% of their annual electricity consumption of 12,128 kWh per year. On the EnergySage Marketplace, solar shoppers in San Francisco, CA pay an average of $18,000 for a 6.7 kW solar panel system prior to\n            \n                incentives.\n            \n            \n\n                The savings from offsetting 100% of an electric bill with solar can add up fast!\n                Assuming an 5.9% annual increase in electricity prices and that you install your system with a $0-down loan,\n                you can expect to save $5,500 in your first year,\n                $30,800 over five years, $71,800 over 10 years,\n                and $199,200 over 20 years on electric bills in San Francisco, CA.\n                Over your system\u2019s lifetime you\u2019ll save more by financing your solar system with a cash purchase,\n                but you won\u2019t start saving in year one. Learn more about how to finance your solar panel system.\n\n\n                How much can you save by going solar in San Francisco, CA?\n            \nHow much can you save on electric bills with community solar in San Francisco, CA?\nEven if onsite solar doesn\u2019t make sense for you, you can still participate in the clean energy transition and save on your electric bills by subscribing to a community solar farm.\n                Community solar programs in San Francisco, CA\n                typically save you 5-15% in electricity costs over the course of the year. For the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA, 10% annual savings would amount to $547 in savings per year.\n\n                How much can you save by subscribing to a community solar farm in San Francisco, CA?\n            \nElectric bills in San Francisco, CA\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh.\nElectric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either\n                using less electricity\n                or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity.\nThe average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years!\nAssuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases.\nInstalling solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years.\n                Calculating your savings from investing in solar\n                is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment. When you sign up on the EnergySage Marketplace, you'll be able to receive and compare solar quotes side-by-side from qualified solar installers in your area.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Shrink That Footprint\n\nAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\n\nBy: Lindsay Wilson\n\nIntroduction \u2013 Electricity Used By A Home\n[Update 03/09/2024: we updated the average household electricity consumption figures using the latest data from EIA from 2023 which is current as of March 2024]\n\nAs of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year. This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day. Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.\n\nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\n\nWe use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures. The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding period.\n\nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10,204 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\n\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\n\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\n\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.\n\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\n\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\n\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\n\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\n\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\n\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh. We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\n\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\n\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\n\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\n\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\n\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. This figure increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\n\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.\n\nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023. This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it. Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d. What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much. Canada and United States really stand out. We included also the number of households. You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger. Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\n\nAcross the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\n\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. In India these are 66% and 5 respectively and in Nigeria 50% and 5. Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\n\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\n\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\n\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\n\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\n\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.

Community solar programs in San Francisco, CA typically save you 5-15% in electricity costs over the course of the year. For the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA, 10% annual savings would amount to $547 in savings per year.\n\nHow much can you save by subscribing to a community solar farm in San Francisco, CA?\n\nElectric bills in San Francisco, CA\n\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh. Electric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either using less electricity or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\n\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\n\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\n\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\n\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years! Assuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases. Installing solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years. Calculating your savings from investing in solar is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\n\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\n\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment.

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.  If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below.  The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA.  There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.\u00a0For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\nI have an Economics degree from\u00a0UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at\u00a0BNEF\u00a0and continue to work as a strategy consultant at\u00a0Maneas. \u00a0I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\nHello Lindsay,\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

For the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA, 10% annual savings would amount to $547 in savings per year.\n\n                How much can you save by subscribing to a community solar farm in San Francisco, CA?\n            \nElectric bills in San Francisco, CA\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh.\nElectric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either\n                using less electricity\n                or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity.\nThe average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years!\nAssuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases.\nInstalling solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years.\n                Calculating your savings from investing in solar\n                is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment. When you sign up on the EnergySage Marketplace, you'll be able to receive and compare solar quotes side-by-side from qualified solar installers in your area.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Shrink That Footprint\n\nAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\n\nBy: Lindsay Wilson\n\nIntroduction \u2013 Electricity Used By A Home\n[Update 03/09/2024: we updated the average household electricity consumption figures using the latest data from EIA from 2023 which is current as of March 2024]\n\nAs of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year. This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day. Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.\n\nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\n\nWe use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures. The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding period.\n\nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10,204 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\n\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\n\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\n\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.\n\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\n\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\n\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\n\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\n\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\n\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh. We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\n\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\n\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\n\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\n\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\n\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. This figure increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\n\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.\n\nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023. This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it. Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d. What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much. Canada and United States really stand out. We included also the number of households. You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger. Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\n\nAcross the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\n\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. In India these are 66% and 5 respectively and in Nigeria 50% and 5. Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\n\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\n\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\n\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\n\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\n\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.  If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below.  The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA.  There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.\u00a0For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\nI have an Economics degree from\u00a0UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at\u00a0BNEF\u00a0and continue to work as a strategy consultant at\u00a0Maneas. \u00a0I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\nHello Lindsay,\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world. Thanks for all your research on energy. You may be interested on my company and my invention, patented and prototype only 10% fuel used.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

The amount that you can save with solar in San Francisco, CA is based on two factors: how much you spend on electricity now and how much of your electric bill you can offset with solar.\nBased on the intensity and amount of sunlight hours in San Francisco, CA, the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA will need a 6.7 kilowatt (kW) solar panel system to offset 100% of their annual electricity consumption of 12,128 kWh per year. On the EnergySage Marketplace, solar shoppers in San Francisco, CA pay an average of $18,000 for a 6.7 kW solar panel system prior to\n            \n                incentives.\n            \n            \n\n                The savings from offsetting 100% of an electric bill with solar can add up fast!\n                Assuming an 5.9% annual increase in electricity prices and that you install your system with a $0-down loan,\n                you can expect to save $5,500 in your first year,\n                $30,800 over five years, $71,800 over 10 years,\n                and $199,200 over 20 years on electric bills in San Francisco, CA.\n                Over your system\u2019s lifetime you\u2019ll save more by financing your solar system with a cash purchase,\n                but you won\u2019t start saving in year one. Learn more about how to finance your solar panel system.\n\n\n                How much can you save by going solar in San Francisco, CA?\n            \nHow much can you save on electric bills with community solar in San Francisco, CA?\nEven if onsite solar doesn\u2019t make sense for you, you can still participate in the clean energy transition and save on your electric bills by subscribing to a community solar farm.\n                Community solar programs in San Francisco, CA\n                typically save you 5-15% in electricity costs over the course of the year. For the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA, 10% annual savings would amount to $547 in savings per year.\n\n                How much can you save by subscribing to a community solar farm in San Francisco, CA?\n            \nElectric bills in San Francisco, CA\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh.\nElectric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either\n                using less electricity\n                or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity.\nThe average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years!\nAssuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases.\nInstalling solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years.\n                Calculating your savings from investing in solar\n                is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment. When you sign up on the EnergySage Marketplace, you'll be able to receive and compare solar quotes side-by-side from qualified solar installers in your area.

States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh).

The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low.

This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

    "Summarized_Document2": "Cost of Electricity in San Francisco, CA\n\nWhy you can trust EnergySage\n\nThe data on this page comes from real solar quotes to real solar shoppers on the EnergySage Marketplace. We give you access to transparent information so you can confidently make informed energy decisions. Learn more about how our Marketplace works and how we make money.\n\nOn average, San Francisco, CA residents spend about $456 per month on electricity. That adds up to $5,472 per year. That\u2019s 88% higher than the national average electric bill of $2,914. The average electric rates in San Francisco, CA cost 45 \u00a2/kilowatt-hour (kWh), so that means that the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA is using 1,010 kWh of electricity per month, and 12,128 kWh over the course of the year.\n\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\n\nThis data is aggregated over the past 1 month.\n\nKey takeaways about electric rates in San Francisco, CA\n\nElectric bill savings with solar in San Francisco, CA\n\nSolar saves you money by reducing or eliminating your monthly electric bill. The amount that you can save with solar in San Francisco, CA is based on two factors: how much you spend on electricity now and how much of your electric bill you can offset with solar. Based on the intensity and amount of sunlight hours in San Francisco, CA, the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA will need a 6.7 kilowatt (kW) solar panel system to offset 100% of their annual electricity consumption of 12,128 kWh per year. On the EnergySage Marketplace, solar shoppers in San Francisco, CA pay an average of $18,000 for a 6.7 kW solar panel system prior to incentives.\n\nThe savings from offsetting 100% of an electric bill with solar can add up fast! Assuming a 5.9% annual increase in electricity prices and that you install your system with a $0-down loan, you can expect to save $5,500 in your first year, $30,800 over five years, $71,800 over 10 years, and $199,200 over 20 years on electric bills in San Francisco, CA. Over your system\u2019s lifetime you\u2019ll save more by financing your solar system with a cash purchase, but you won\u2019t start saving in year one. Learn more about how to finance your solar panel system.\n\nHow much can you save by going solar in San Francisco, CA?\n\nHow much can you save on electric bills with community solar in San Francisco, CA?\n\nEven if onsite solar doesn\u2019t make sense for you, you can still participate in the clean energy transition and save on your electric bills by subscribing to a community solar farm. Community solar programs in San Francisco, CA typically save you 5-15% in electricity costs over the course of the year. For the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA, 10% annual savings would amount to $547 in savings per year.\n\nHow much can you save by subscribing to a community solar farm in San Francisco, CA?\n\nElectric bills in San Francisco, CA\n\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh. Electric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either using less electricity or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\n\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\n\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\n\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\n\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years! Assuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases. Installing solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years. Calculating your savings from investing in solar is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\n\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\n\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment. When you sign up on the EnergySage Marketplace, you'll be able to receive and compare solar quotes side-by-side from qualified solar installers in your area. We're here to help along the way - talk with one of our Energy Advisors to learn more about your unique quotes, any local solar incentives you may be eligible for, or any other questions about saving on electric bills with solar.\n\nFrequently asked questions about electric rates and solar\n\nRecommended for You\n\nSolar panel buyer's guide\n\nCompare solar panels from leading brands\n\nCommunity solar\n\nSave money with renewable energy by subscribing to a community solar farm\n\nAll about solar\n\nLearn the basics of solar energy for your home so you can compare quotes with confidence\n\nCompare solar panels from leading brands\n\nSave money with renewable energy by subscribing to a community solar farm\n\nLearn the basics of solar energy for your home so you can compare quotes with confidence\n\nENERGYSAGE is a registered trademark and the EnergySage logo is a trademark of EnergySage, Inc.

series whenever new monthly data are added; the inclusion of the most recent LFS data in the calculation process; update of seasonal adjustment models with complete annual data.\nCompared with the rates published in News Release of 3 April 2024, the February 2024 unemployment rate for the EU has been revised from 6.0% to 6.1%, while the unemployment rate for the euro area remained unchanged. Among EU Member States, the rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) upwards for Spain (by 0.3 pp) as well as for Finland and Sweden (by 0.2 pp each). The rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) downwards for Greece (by 0.2 pp).\nCountry notes\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden as well as Iceland and Norway: the trend component is used instead of the more volatile seasonally adjusted data.\nEstonia and Portugal: 3-month moving averages of LFS data are used instead of pure monthly indicators.\nMethods and definitions\nEurostat publishes harmonised unemployment rates for individual EU Member States, the euro area and the EU. These unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The measurement is based on a harmonised data source, the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS).\nBased on the ILO definition, Eurostat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:\nare without work;\nare available to start work within the next two weeks;\nand have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks.\nThe unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.\nThe labour force is the total number of people employed plus unemployed. In this news release unemployment rates are based on employment and unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74.\nThe youth unemployment rate is the number of people aged 15 to 24 unemployed as a percentage of the labour force of the same age. Therefore, the youth unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the share of jobless people in the overall youth population.\nWhen data for the most recent month are not available for a Member State, EU and EA aggregates are calculated using the latest data available for that Member State.\nGeographical information\nEuro area (EA20): Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.\nEuropean Union (EU27): Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden.\nFor more information\nEurostat website section on employment and unemployment\nEurostat database section on unemployment, including non-seasonally adjusted and trend data\nStatistics Explained articles on unemployment\nEurostat metadata on adjusted unemployment series\nEuro indicators dashboard\nRelease calendar for Euro indicators\nEuropean Statistics Code of Practice\nGet in touch\nMedia requests\n\n\n\n\nEurostat Media Support\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 33 408\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: eurostat-mediasupport@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nFurther information on data\n\n\n\n\nThibaut HENRION\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 31 686\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevena CHOLAKOVA\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 35 304\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: estat-monthly-unemployment@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nShare the release\n\nWas this page useful?                \nIf you do not wish to provide more detailed feedback, please just click on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button to send your response. \n\nNeed help?                    \n\nFollow us                    \n\nContact the EU                    \n\nSocial media                    \n\nLegal                    \n\nEU institutions                    \n\n                        EU institutions\n                    \n",

REUTERS/Hollie Adams/File Photo\n(Reuters) - British consumer confidence held at an almost three-year high in August, bolstered by improving sentiment around personal finances and major purchases, according to a survey on Friday that added to positive signals in the wider economy.\nThe GfK Consumer Confidence Index, Britain's longest-running gauge of economic morale among members of the public, was steady in August at -13, matching July's 34-month high. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of -12.\nThe survey follows mostly positive data from companies since Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party won a landslide election victory last month. Business surveys put the economy on course for solid growth in the second half of 2024.\nThe survey's measure of enthusiasm for major purchases rose to its highest level since January 2022, while the outlook for personal finances also notched higher.\n\"This more positive outlook may be due to a mortgage-friendly interest rate cut at the beginning of August, and hopes of more to come,\" said Joe Staton, client strategy director at market research company GfK.\nThe BoE cut borrowing costs from a 16-year high of 5.25% earlier this month but Governor Andrew Bailey and other top officials have signalled they might not follow that up with rapid further reductions in rates.\nInvestors were assigning a less than 30% chance of a September rate cut on Thursday.\nA Reuters poll of economists published on Wednesday suggested the BoE will cut interest rates just once more this year, in November.\nThe GfK report's gauges of past and future economic sentiment cooled, however.\nThe survey of 2,003 people took place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 15.\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by David Milliken)\nCopyright 2024 Thomson Reuters.\nSponsored Bank Accounts\nTags: United Kingdom, Europe\nCredit Cards\nPersonal Loans \nMortgages\nBanking\n\n    Comparative assessments and other editorial opinions are those of U.S. News\n    and have not been previously reviewed, approved or endorsed by any other\n    entities, such as banks, credit card issuers or travel companies.

    "Summarized_Document1": "In March 2024, the euro area seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 6.5%, stable compared to February 2024 and down from 6.6% in March 2023. The EU unemployment rate was 6.0% in March 2024, down from 6.1% in February 2024 and stable compared to March 2023. Eurostat estimates that 13.258 million persons in the EU, including 11.087 million in the euro area, were unemployed in March 2024. Compared to February 2024, unemployment decreased by 74 thousand in the EU and by 94 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, unemployment increased by 175 thousand in the EU and decreased by 51 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, 2.858 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU, including 2.259 million in the euro area. The youth unemployment rate was 14.6% in the EU, down from 14.7% in February 2024, and 14.1% in the euro area, down from 14.4% in the previous month. Compared to February 2024, youth unemployment decreased by 11 thousand in the EU and by 30 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, youth unemployment increased by 150 thousand in the EU and by 36 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, the unemployment rate for women was 6.4% in the EU, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 5.7%, down from 5.8% in the previous month. In the euro area, the unemployment rate for women was 7.0%, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 6.0%, down from 6.1% in the previous month.\n\nThe estimates are based on the International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard definition of unemployment, which includes people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks. Additional indicators such as underemployed part-time workers and persons seeking work but not immediately available are also considered.\n\nThe document includes detailed tables showing seasonally adjusted unemployment rates and the number of unemployed persons in thousands for the euro area, EU, and individual countries from March 2023 to March 2024. For example, in March 2024, Germany had an unemployment rate of 3.2% with 1,421 thousand unemployed persons, while Spain had an unemployment rate of 11.7% with 2,854 thousand unemployed persons.\n\nYouth unemployment rates and numbers are also detailed, with the euro area having a youth unemployment rate of 14.1% in March 2024, down from 14.4% in February 2024, and the EU having a rate of 14.6%, down from 14.7% in February 2024.

    "Summarized_Document2": "UK Consumer Confidence Matches Almost 3-Year High in August\n\n(Reuters) - British consumer confidence held at an almost three-year high in August, bolstered by improving sentiment around personal finances and major purchases, according to a survey on Friday that added to positive signals in the wider economy.\n\nThe GfK Consumer Confidence Index, Britain's longest-running gauge of economic morale among members of the public, was steady in August at -13, matching July's 34-month high. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of -12.\n\nThe survey follows mostly positive data from companies since Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party won a landslide election victory last month. Business surveys put the economy on course for solid growth in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe survey's measure of enthusiasm for major purchases rose to its highest level since January 2022, while the outlook for personal finances also notched higher.\n\n\"This more positive outlook may be due to a mortgage-friendly interest rate cut at the beginning of August, and hopes of more to come,\" said Joe Staton, client strategy director at market research company GfK.\n\nThe BoE cut borrowing costs from a 16-year high of 5.25% earlier this month but Governor Andrew Bailey and other top officials have signalled they might not follow that up with rapid further reductions in rates.\n\nInvestors were assigning a less than 30% chance of a September rate cut on Thursday.\n\nA Reuters poll of economists published on Wednesday suggested the BoE will cut interest rates just once more this year, in November.\n\nThe GfK report's gauges of past and future economic sentiment cooled, however.\n\nThe survey of 2,003 people took place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 15.\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by David Milliken)\n\nCopyright 2024 Thomson Reuters.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years.

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years.

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Document2": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives:\nBuild microtargeting capabilities\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\nQuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nRather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments\u00a0at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases.\nInvest in wellness\nA rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging).\nPropel the social\u2013digital experience\nCompanies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries)\u00a0become more important.\nWe see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers.\nOffer premium products where they matter\nOffering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures.\nIn this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.\nThe authors wish to thank Cait Pearson, Heather Gouinlock, and Keir Sullivan for their contributions to this article.\nThis article was edited by Alexandra Mondalek, an editor in the New York office.",
    "Summarized_Document1": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "If you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands. These are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed. In this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d Nine trends defining the global consumer market To forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth. Who is the future consumer? Consumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved. 1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend. Among this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies. This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies. 2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood. Despite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age. In emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets said they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe and 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk. 3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers. This intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers. What will consumers want? What consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies. 4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups. In advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts. Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior. This weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers. One beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality. 5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims outpaced sales of products without such claims. While young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023. Younger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims. 6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually. In advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets. In emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States. It\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so. Weight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years. By 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective. 7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually by 2040. A higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well. Where will consumers shop? Knowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world. 8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend. Just because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas. Emerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world. 9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind. Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States. Attempts to grow the social-commerce market in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.

    "Document1": "Health Spending\nHow much and why 2024 premiums are expected to grow in Affordable Care Act Marketplaces\nBy Jared Ortaliza,\u00a0Matthew McGough,\u00a0Meghan Salaga,\u00a0Krutika Amin Twitter, and\u00a0Cynthia Cox Twitter\nKFF\nAugust 4, 2023\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nHealth insurers submit rate filings annually to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans for the coming year. A relatively small share of the population is enrolled in these plans (compared to the number in employer plans), but these filings are generally more detailed and publicly available. These filings provide insight into what factors insurers expect will drive health costs for the coming year.\nFor 2024, across 320 insurers participating in the 50 states and DC, this analysis shows a median proposed premium increase of 6%. Based on a more detailed analysis of publicly available documents from 58 insurers, growth in health care prices stood out as a key factor driving costs in 2024. In addition to inflation, insurers also mention changes in pandemic-related costs and the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage, though the latter are having a small, if any, effect on premiums.\nMost proposed rate increases for 2024 ACA Marketplace plans fall between 2% and 10%, with a median increase of 6%\nAmong 320 ACA Marketplace participating insurers nationally, premium changes range from a drop of \u201315% to an increase of 100%, but most proposed premium changes for 2024 fall between about 2% and 10% (the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively). Of the 320 filings, 41 insurers proposed decreasing premiums. On the other end of the spectrum, 76 insurers requested premium increases greater than 10%. These filings are preliminary and may change during the rate review process. 2024 rates will be finalized in late summer. A table in the appendix shows proposed premium increases by state and insurer.\nThe rate increase for an insurer is a weighted average across all of its products within a state (i.e., bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans). These weighted average premium changes will differ from the percent change in the benchmark silver plan, which is the basis for federal subsidies. Most enrollees in this market receive a subsidy and are not expected to face these premium increases. However, premium increases could result in higher federal spending on subsidies.\nWhat\u2019s driving 2024 premium changes?\nThe chart above shows premium changes for 320 insurers across all 50 states and DC. For the subsequent sections, this analysis focuses on a subset of these rate filings (58 insurers across 11 states and DC) in more detail to understand the factors driving premium changes in 2024. These insurers and states were selected because they have earlier and more transparent (less redacted) public reporting of proposed rate justifications. For context, though, the 58 insurers reviewed in this section have somewhat higher proposed rate increases, with a median of 9%.\nHealth Spending\nHealth & Wellbeing\nInflation\nAs is the case in most years, medical trend \u2013 which includes growth in prices paid by insurers for medical services and medications, as well as growth in the utilization of health care \u2013 is a key driver of premium growth in 2024. Many insurers expect utilization to grow relative to 2022, but price growth is generally playing a larger role in medical trend than utilization is.\nOf the insurer rate filings reviewed in detail, and when an annualized trend was publicly available, the median medical trend was 8%, with most reporting trend in the 7-9% range.\n\u201cThe primary driver of the premium increase is the increases in the cost of healthcare.\u00a0 The increases are associated with increases in the \u201cunit\u201d cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or \u201cutilization\u201d, by members.\u201d \u2013 Anthem Health Plans, Kentucky\nWhile health sector prices typically outpace price growth in the rest of the economy, the last two years have been an exception. Recent medical price growth has been similar to past years, while growth in prices in the rest of the economy has grown at a faster than usual pace. As contracts between insurers and providers are typically negotiated for a year or more, medical inflation often lags that in the rest of the economy.\nLooking ahead to 2024, many insurers are expecting broader economic inflation to flow through to the health system and put upward pressure on premiums.\n\u201cSignificant inflation in the cost of goods and services in all sectors of the economy has had a profound impact on the cost of medical services, and BCBSRI expects to see substantial increases in provider unit costs for 2024.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island\n\u201cWe expect unit cost trends to be higher in 2023 and 2024 due to inflation, supply shortages and labor shortages. Inpatient hospital cost per day trends will be increasing as hospitals seek to recover from 2022 financial losses.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\n\u201cHealth insurance premiums must correspond with the cost of our members\u2019 medical care, which continues to rise at an unparalleled rate year after year and is projected to increase significantly in 2024. Rising medical costs are the primary driver of our proposed individual rates and increase requested premiums by 19.1%.\u201d \u2013 Highmark, New York\nIn addition to driving up prices paid by insurers to providers, inflation is also putting upward pressure on insurers\u2019 administrative costs, such as their own staffing costs.\n\u201cBlue Cross VT is increasing base administrative costs (see section 3.8.7), which has the effect of increasing the premiums by 0.1 percent for individuals and 0.3 percent for small groups. This modest increase reflects current and expected inflationary levels.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nCOVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency\nThis year, as they did in prior years, insurers acknowledge there is still uncertainty surrounding the future of the pandemic. With the end of the Public Health Emergency (PHE) this year, plans can now charge cost sharing for COVID-testing, which could have a downward effect on insurer costs and therefore a downward effect on premiums. Conversely, the COVID vaccine will be commercialized, meaning increased cost to insurers on a per-dose basis. The use of COVID-19 related prevention and treatment may diminish, though, if severe cases continue to be less common. On net, most insurers that publicly quantify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in their filings expect their pandemic-related costs to decrease in 2024, having a small downward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMVP is assuming a 10% reduction in Covid testing costs in the projection period due to a utilization decrease, resulting in the removal of $0.31 PMPM. We expect demand for testing to decrease once cost sharing is reinstituted.\u201d \u2013 MVP Health Care, VT\n\u201cCosts related to COVID-19 decreased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, and have reached a relatively consistent month-to-month level since March 2022. We expect 2023 and 2024 COVID related costs will continue at this lower level and possibly trend slightly downward as population immunity continues to grow.\u201d \u2013 Molina Healthcare of Washington\nThe pandemic had a significant downward effect on utilization of health care generally early on, particularly in 2020, but insurers are expecting a continued return to more normal levels going forward.\n\u201cWhile 2022 trends are lower than 2021, we expect utilization trends to moderate and return to pre-COVID-19 levels over 2023 and 2024.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\nFew insurers mention pent up demand for the non-COVID care that was missed in 2020, and most of those that do mention it say the level of use they are expecting in the remainder of 2023 and 2024 is consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Very few insurers expect pent up demand to drive up costs in 2024.\nUnwinding of Medicaid continuous enrollment\nOn April 1, 2023, states started unwinding the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, resulting in at least 3.8 million people being disenrolled from Medicaid as of August 1, 2023. As a result, some people who have been disenrolled and deemed no longer eligible for Medicaid may enroll in the ACA marketplaces, where they may be eligible for subsidies.\nAbout half of the insurer rate filings reviewed do not mention Medicaid disenrollments in their 2024 premium filings. Those that mention the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage often say the impact on costs is difficult to predict, so they are not adjusting premiums. Several insurers say there will be an increase in their ACA enrollment, but no effect on market morbidity (i.e., the average health of enrollees), meaning no net impact on premiums.\n\u201cOur assumption is that the new members formerly in Medicaid will select a Blue Cross VT plan comparable to the current market share, about 60 percent, resulting in the Blue Cross VT individual market growing by 1,609 members and the Blue Cross VT small group market growing by 1,711 members. We further project that the new Medicaid members will have the same risk score relationship between the carriers as the existing market; therefore, the risk score impact is 1.000 for both carriers.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nA relatively small number of insurers expect the Medicaid unwinding to lead to a sicker group of people signing up for ACA plans, which would then have an upward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMedicaid redetermination and an otherwise shrinking market would lead to an increase in market average morbidity as relatively sicker members will enter and healthier members will leave the market.\u201d \u2013 BridgeSpan Health Company of Oregon\nOther Potential Drivers of Costs\nSome other factors that insurers mentioned in their 2024 rate filings, though much less commonly than the factors described above include:\nDiabetes and Weight Loss Drugs. Diabetic drugs, such as Semaglutide, are increasingly being utilized for weight loss. Given the increasing cost and use of Semaglutide and related drugs, a handful of insurers mention these drugs as having an upward effect on their pharmaceutical spending.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA extends pandemic-era enhanced subsidies through 2025, bringing down premium costs for most consumers in this market. Few insurers mentioned the impact of the IRA subsidies on premiums as there has been no change in the amount of the subsidy from last year.\nOther federal policy changes do not appear to be driving premiums. Among insurer filings reviewed, only one mentioned the impact of new restrictions on surprise billing but reported that no adjustment was made for it.\u00a0 None of the insurers reviewed mentioned the impact of the administrative fix to the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d in their filings.\nDiscussion\nSimilar to last year, it appears that 2024 rates may rise moderately. The median proposed rate increase is 6% nationally, with most proposed increases falling between 2% and 10%. Most enrollees in this market are subsidized and do not pay the full premium. However, premium increases can affect federal spending and the driving factors behind these increases illustrate broader trends driving health costs in 2024.\nA key driver of the increase in premiums in 2024 appears to be rising health prices. While prices for health services tend to grow every year, it also appears that inflation in the rest of the economy may now be starting to flow into the health sector. Rising prices and utilization are not necessarily specific to the ACA individual market. Similar levels of medical trend were observed in small group market filings as well.\nMany insurers that publicly quantified the impacts of the pandemic are projecting a decrease in COVID-19 related costs in 2024. There are multiple factors considered when evaluating the total impact of COVID-19 on costs. Some insurers mentioned higher costs associated with vaccine costs shifting to insurers. Resumed member cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, however, may have a downward effect on premiums as members seek out these services less due to their cost.\nRelative to inflation and the pandemic, fewer insurers mentioned the impact of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, and there was variation in how insurers project its impact on costs. A very small number of insurers mentioned the upward effects of diabetic therapy and weight loss drugs on pharmaceutical trends, mostly pointing to increasing costs and utilization of said drugs. Federal policy changes, like the administrative fix to the Family Glitch and the No Surprises Act, were rarely mentioned by insurers, if at all, despite their potential impacts on enrollment and costs.\nMethods\nProposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov for 320 insurers across 50 states and Washington, DC. Additionally, 58 insurer actuarial memoranda were collected from state rate review websites and were comprehensively reviewed to understand the factors contributing to rate changes. These 58 insurers were from the following Marketplaces: District of Columbia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Insurer actuarial memoranda were systematically evaluated for key words related to, but not limited to, medical trend, COVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency, Medicaid redeterminations, Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, family glitch, surprise billing, telehealth, price transparency, and diabetes or weight loss drugs. Recorded medical trend values reported here are annualized.\nAppendix\nThe Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF\u00a0are partnering to monitor how well the U.S. healthcare system is performing in terms of quality and cost.\nLooking for more data?\nFind out more details about U.S. healthcare from our updated dashboard.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\n\u00a9 2024 PETERSON-KFF Health System Tracker \u00a0 All Rights Reserved",

Contributing factors include growing healthcare costs, stricter payer reimbursement policies, and claims processing errors. Providers are seeing an uptick in nonpayment, plus an added burden on administrative staff, disrupted patient care, and hits to the bottom line.\nExperian Health surveyed over 200 healthcare professionals, primarily in executive or management roles, to better understand the current state of claims. The findings of the State of Claims 2024 report break down the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, reasons for denials, and providers\u2019 concerns about reimbursement.\nRising healthcare costs: who will foot the bill?\nThe U.S. healthcare system is the most expensive in the world, and costs continue to rise. In 2022, healthcare spending reached $4.5 trillion, a threefold increase from $1.4 trillion in 2000. In 2023, costs rose 7.5% to $4.8 trillion. Paying for healthcare is becoming more and more out of reach for patients and causing great concern. Over three-quarters (77%) of providers worry patients will skip out on their medical bills.\nPayer reimbursement challenges are also weighing heavily on healthcare leaders\u2019 minds. More than 75% are worried about nonpayment due to ever-evolving payer policy changes. They also have concerns about the pre-authorization struggles that have continued since 2022, as reported in the State of Claims 2022 survey. Hospitals are particularly feeling the financial pinch of operating within such an expensive environment and face uncertainties about meeting financial obligations on top of other major post-pandemic challenges like staff shortages.\nThe impact of claims denials\nProviders continue to see claims being denied in greater numbers. In 2022, 42% of respondents said denials are increasing. The number jumped to 77% in 2024. Similarly, the time it takes to be reimbursed is increasing, per 67% of respondents. That number was 51% in 2022.\nIn 2024, 84% of healthcare organizations\u00a0will make reducing denied claims a top priority. The Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy reports that the burden of denied claims totals around $260 billion\u00a0annually. The impact of claim denials is far-reaching, affecting the patient experience and revenue cycles. Struggles with claims also burden staff and drain resources, contributing to even more losses.\nThe growing challenge of data collection, verification and authorization\nSuccessful claims processing depends on accuracy. However, achieving accuracy in data collection, verification, and authorization processes remains a continued challenge for claims management teams. Nearly half of respondents (46%) in the State of Claims 2024 report identified missing or inaccurate information as the primary cause for denial. Inaccurate or missing data also creates extra steps in claims processing, resulting in the need for secondary checks and \u201cwasted\u201d healthcare dollars. Survey respondents reported using multiple solutions to collect all the necessary patient data for claims, with some using as many as four different products.\nLeveling the playing field in claims management with technology\nStaying on top of reimbursement requirements and processes is complex, resource-demanding and time-consuming. Inaccuracies commonplace with manual processing exacerbate issues and further extend processing and reimbursement times. However, automation and AI technology have proven effective at reducing claims denials and the burden of manual processing.\n\u201cAdding AI in claims processing cuts down denials significantly,\u201d Tom Bonner, Principal Product Manager at Experian Health, explains. AI automation quickly flags errors, allowing claims editing before payer submission. It\u2019s not science fiction\u2014AI is the tool hospitals need for better healthcare claims denial prevention and management.\u201d\nDuring the pandemic, providers embraced new technology to meet immediate needs; however, that momentum slowed in recent years. In 2022, survey data revealed that 62% of providers were using some form of automation and AI technology. Yet, in 2024, only 31% said they used\u00a0this type of technology.\nHere\u2019s how claims automation can help healthcare organizations improve claims success rates:\n\nManage the entire claims process: Using an automated, scalable claims management system, like ClaimSource\u00ae, helps reduce denials and increase revenue. Providers can manage their entire claims cycle in a single application and ensure claims are clean before submission.\nSubmit more accurate claims: An automated claims submission tool, like ClaimScrubber, helps identify errors that typically result in denials or underpayments before submission. This results in quicker payments, less time chasing aged accounts receivables, and improved cash flow.\nEliminate manual processes: Providers that use Denials Workflow Manager can target claims that need attention immediately, managing denials more effectively and increasing reimbursements significantly.\nImprove cash flow: Enhanced Claim Status helps providers take an early-and-often approach to monitoring claim status in the adjudication process. It eliminates manual follow-up tasks, allowing providers to respond early and accurately to pended, returned-to-provider, denied or zero-pay transactions.\nPrevent denials: Experian Health\u2019s AI Advantage\u2122, an AI-driven platform, uses an organization\u2019s own historical claims data, plus Experian Health\u2019s sophisticated knowledge of payer rules, to continuously learn and adapt to an ever-changing payer policy landscape. This technology helps providers better predict and prevent claims denials, focus on high-priority claims, and boost overall revenue.\n\nAdaptation of technology is likely on the rise with 45% of healthcare leaders planning to invest in automation in the next six months. Over the next year, these investments could pay off if claims denials start to decrease as a result, prompting more healthcare organizations to boost investments in claims management technology.\nDownload the State of Claims 2024 report to get the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, or contact us to learn how Experian Health can help with better claims management.\nGet the report Claims management solutions\n\nPrev\n\nRelated Posts\n\nWhat is revenue cycle management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nThis blog examines revenue cycle management (RCM) in healthcare process as a whole: what it is, how it works, and more.\nPublished: September 10, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nWhat is denial management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nDiscover the importance of healthcare denial management and get strategies to minimize claim denials and improve your financial performance.\nPublished: September 6, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nRevenue cycle management best practices: a guide f...\nFeatured \nDiscover revenue cycle management best practices healthcare leaders should follow to optimize workflows and promote financial stability.\nPublished: August 13, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\nSubscribe to our blog\nEnter your name and email for the latest updates.\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nTags\nai advantage ai advantage denial triage ai advantage predictive denials artificial intelligence automation claim denials claims Claim Scrubber claims management ClaimSource collections Collections Optimization Manager consumer data Coverage Discovery COVID-19 data Data and Analytics digital front door identity management Insurance Eligibility Verification online scheduling patient access patient access curator Patient Collections patient engagement patient estimates patient experience patient financial advisor patient financial clearance patient identity patient payment patient payment estimates patient portal patient registration patient satisfaction patient schedule patientsimple price transparency pymnts registration accelerator Revenue Cycle Management self-scheduling social determinants of health state of claims 2022 state of patient access\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nSubscribe\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\n\nLegal Terms & Conditions\nPrivacy Center\nU.S. Data Privacy Policy\nAd Choices\nPress\nCareers\nInvestor Relations\nContact Us\n\nEXPERIAN'S DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION Learn more how Experian is committed\nDATA PRIVACY Your privacy choices\n\u00a9 2024 Experian Information Solutions, Inc.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Health insurers submit annual rate filings to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans. For 2024, 320 insurers across 50 states and DC propose a median premium increase of 6%. The proposed changes range from a decrease of 15% to an increase of 100%, with most falling between 2% and 10%. These filings are preliminary and subject to change during the rate review process, with final rates expected in late summer.Key drivers of the 2024 premium changes include:1. **Health Spending and Inflation**: Medical trend, which includes growth in prices for medical services and medications, is a significant factor. The median medical trend is 8%, with most insurers reporting trends between 7-9%. Broader economic inflation is also expected to impact health system costs.2. **COVID-19 and the End of the Public Health Emergency**: Insurers expect a decrease in pandemic-related costs in 2024. The end of the Public Health Emergency allows plans to charge cost-sharing for COVID-testing, potentially reducing insurer costs. However, the commercialization of the COVID vaccine may increase costs.3. **Unwinding of Medicaid Continuous Enrollment**: As of August 1, 2023, at least 3.8 million people have been disenrolled from Medicaid. Some may enroll in ACA marketplaces, but the impact on premiums is uncertain. Some insurers expect no significant effect, while a few anticipate an increase in market morbidity.4. **Other Factors**: A few insurers mention the impact of diabetes and weight loss drugs, such as Semaglutide, on pharmaceutical spending. Federal policy changes like the Inflation Reduction Act and the No Surprises Act were rarely mentioned.The analysis includes data from 58 insurers across 11 states and DC, with a median proposed rate increase of 9%. The findings suggest that rising health prices and broader economic inflation are primary drivers of premium increases for 2024. The impact of the pandemic is expected to decrease, while the effects of Medicaid disenrollment and other factors vary among insurers.Methods: Proposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov and state rate review websites. Insurer actuarial memoranda were reviewed for key factors contributing to rate changes, including medical trend, COVID-19, Medicaid redeterminations, and other relevant topics.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Despite increased access to claims management technology, claims denials are still on the rise in 2024. Contributing factors include growing healthcare costs, stricter payer reimbursement policies, and claims processing errors. Providers are seeing an uptick in nonpayment, plus an added burden on administrative staff, disrupted patient care, and hits to the bottom line. Experian Health surveyed over 200 healthcare professionals, primarily in executive or management roles, to better understand the current state of claims. The findings of the State of Claims 2024 report break down the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, reasons for denials, and providers\u2019 concerns about reimbursement. Rising healthcare costs: who will foot the bill? The U.S. healthcare system is the most expensive in the world, and costs continue to rise. In 2022, healthcare spending reached $4.5 trillion, a threefold increase from $1.4 trillion in 2000. In 2023, costs rose 7.5% to $4.8 trillion. Paying for healthcare is becoming more and more out of reach for patients and causing great concern. Over three-quarters (77%) of providers worry patients will skip out on their medical bills. Payer reimbursement challenges are also weighing heavily on healthcare leaders\u2019 minds. More than 75% are worried about nonpayment due to ever-evolving payer policy changes. They also have concerns about the pre-authorization struggles that have continued since 2022, as reported in the State of Claims 2022 survey. Hospitals are particularly feeling the financial pinch of operating within such an expensive environment and face uncertainties about meeting financial obligations on top of other major post-pandemic challenges like staff shortages. The impact of claims denials Providers continue to see claims being denied in greater numbers. In 2022, 42% of respondents said denials are increasing. The number jumped to 77% in 2024. Similarly, the time it takes to be reimbursed is increasing, per 67% of respondents. That number was 51% in 2022. In 2024, 84% of healthcare organizations will make reducing denied claims a top priority. The Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy reports that the burden of denied claims totals around $260 billion annually. The impact of claim denials is far-reaching, affecting the patient experience and revenue cycles. Struggles with claims also burden staff and drain resources, contributing to even more losses. The growing challenge of data collection, verification and authorization Successful claims processing depends on accuracy. However, achieving accuracy in data collection, verification, and authorization processes remains a continued challenge for claims management teams. Nearly half of respondents (46%) in the State of Claims 2024 report identified missing or inaccurate information as the primary cause for denial. Inaccurate or missing data also creates extra steps in claims processing, resulting in the need for secondary checks and \u201cwasted\u201d healthcare dollars. Survey respondents reported using multiple solutions to collect all the necessary patient data for claims, with some using as many as four different products. Leveling the playing field in claims management with technology Staying on top of reimbursement requirements and processes is complex, resource-demanding and time-consuming. Inaccuracies commonplace with manual processing exacerbate issues and further extend processing and reimbursement times. However, automation and AI technology have proven effective at reducing claims denials and the burden of manual processing. \u201cAdding AI in claims processing cuts down denials significantly,\u201d Tom Bonner, Principal Product Manager at Experian Health, explains. AI automation quickly flags errors, allowing claims editing before payer submission. It\u2019s not science fiction\u2014AI is the tool hospitals need for better healthcare claims denial prevention and management.\u201d During the pandemic, providers embraced new technology to meet immediate needs; however, that momentum slowed in recent years. In 2022, survey data revealed that 62% of providers were using some form of automation and AI technology. Yet, in 2024, only 31% said they used this type of technology. Here\u2019s how claims automation can help healthcare organizations improve claims success rates: Manage the entire claims process: Using an automated, scalable claims management system, like ClaimSource\u00ae, helps reduce denials and increase revenue. Providers can manage their entire claims cycle in a single application and ensure claims are clean before submission. Submit more accurate claims: An automated claims submission tool, like ClaimScrubber, helps identify errors that typically result in denials or underpayments before submission. This results in quicker payments, less time chasing aged accounts receivables, and improved cash flow. Eliminate manual processes: Providers that use Denials Workflow Manager can target claims that need attention immediately, managing denials more effectively and increasing reimbursements significantly. Improve cash flow: Enhanced Claim Status helps providers take an early-and-often approach to monitoring claim status in the adjudication process. It eliminates manual follow-up tasks, allowing providers to respond early and accurately to pended, returned-to-provider, denied or zero-pay transactions. Prevent denials: Experian Health\u2019s AI Advantage\u2122, an AI-driven platform, uses an organization\u2019s own historical claims data, plus Experian Health\u2019s sophisticated knowledge of payer rules, to continuously learn and adapt to an ever-changing payer policy landscape. This technology helps providers better predict and prevent claims denials, focus on high-priority claims, and boost overall revenue. Adaptation of technology is likely on the rise with 45% of healthcare leaders planning to invest in automation in the next six months. Over the next year, these investments could pay off if claims denials start to decrease as a result, prompting more healthcare organizations to boost investments in claims management technology.

    "Document1": "Health Spending\nHow much and why 2024 premiums are expected to grow in Affordable Care Act Marketplaces\nBy Jared Ortaliza,\u00a0Matthew McGough,\u00a0Meghan Salaga,\u00a0Krutika Amin Twitter, and\u00a0Cynthia Cox Twitter\nKFF\nAugust 4, 2023\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nHealth insurers submit rate filings annually to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans for the coming year. A relatively small share of the population is enrolled in these plans (compared to the number in employer plans), but these filings are generally more detailed and publicly available. These filings provide insight into what factors insurers expect will drive health costs for the coming year.\nFor 2024, across 320 insurers participating in the 50 states and DC, this analysis shows a median proposed premium increase of 6%. Based on a more detailed analysis of publicly available documents from 58 insurers, growth in health care prices stood out as a key factor driving costs in 2024. In addition to inflation, insurers also mention changes in pandemic-related costs and the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage, though the latter are having a small, if any, effect on premiums.\nMost proposed rate increases for 2024 ACA Marketplace plans fall between 2% and 10%, with a median increase of 6%\nAmong 320 ACA Marketplace participating insurers nationally, premium changes range from a drop of \u201315% to an increase of 100%, but most proposed premium changes for 2024 fall between about 2% and 10% (the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively). Of the 320 filings, 41 insurers proposed decreasing premiums. On the other end of the spectrum, 76 insurers requested premium increases greater than 10%. These filings are preliminary and may change during the rate review process. 2024 rates will be finalized in late summer. A table in the appendix shows proposed premium increases by state and insurer.\nThe rate increase for an insurer is a weighted average across all of its products within a state (i.e., bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans). These weighted average premium changes will differ from the percent change in the benchmark silver plan, which is the basis for federal subsidies. Most enrollees in this market receive a subsidy and are not expected to face these premium increases. However, premium increases could result in higher federal spending on subsidies.\nWhat\u2019s driving 2024 premium changes?\nThe chart above shows premium changes for 320 insurers across all 50 states and DC. For the subsequent sections, this analysis focuses on a subset of these rate filings (58 insurers across 11 states and DC) in more detail to understand the factors driving premium changes in 2024. These insurers and states were selected because they have earlier and more transparent (less redacted) public reporting of proposed rate justifications. For context, though, the 58 insurers reviewed in this section have somewhat higher proposed rate increases, with a median of 9%.\nHealth Spending\nHealth & Wellbeing\nInflation\nAs is the case in most years, medical trend \u2013 which includes growth in prices paid by insurers for medical services and medications, as well as growth in the utilization of health care \u2013 is a key driver of premium growth in 2024. Many insurers expect utilization to grow relative to 2022, but price growth is generally playing a larger role in medical trend than utilization is.\nOf the insurer rate filings reviewed in detail, and when an annualized trend was publicly available, the median medical trend was 8%, with most reporting trend in the 7-9% range.\n\u201cThe primary driver of the premium increase is the increases in the cost of healthcare.\u00a0 The increases are associated with increases in the \u201cunit\u201d cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or \u201cutilization\u201d, by members.\u201d \u2013 Anthem Health Plans, Kentucky\nWhile health sector prices typically outpace price growth in the rest of the economy, the last two years have been an exception. Recent medical price growth has been similar to past years, while growth in prices in the rest of the economy has grown at a faster than usual pace. As contracts between insurers and providers are typically negotiated for a year or more, medical inflation often lags that in the rest of the economy.\nLooking ahead to 2024, many insurers are expecting broader economic inflation to flow through to the health system and put upward pressure on premiums.\n\u201cSignificant inflation in the cost of goods and services in all sectors of the economy has had a profound impact on the cost of medical services, and BCBSRI expects to see substantial increases in provider unit costs for 2024.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island\n\u201cWe expect unit cost trends to be higher in 2023 and 2024 due to inflation, supply shortages and labor shortages. Inpatient hospital cost per day trends will be increasing as hospitals seek to recover from 2022 financial losses.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\n\u201cHealth insurance premiums must correspond with the cost of our members\u2019 medical care, which continues to rise at an unparalleled rate year after year and is projected to increase significantly in 2024. Rising medical costs are the primary driver of our proposed individual rates and increase requested premiums by 19.1%.\u201d \u2013 Highmark, New York\nIn addition to driving up prices paid by insurers to providers, inflation is also putting upward pressure on insurers\u2019 administrative costs, such as their own staffing costs.\n\u201cBlue Cross VT is increasing base administrative costs (see section 3.8.7), which has the effect of increasing the premiums by 0.1 percent for individuals and 0.3 percent for small groups. This modest increase reflects current and expected inflationary levels.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nCOVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency\nThis year, as they did in prior years, insurers acknowledge there is still uncertainty surrounding the future of the pandemic. With the end of the Public Health Emergency (PHE) this year, plans can now charge cost sharing for COVID-testing, which could have a downward effect on insurer costs and therefore a downward effect on premiums. Conversely, the COVID vaccine will be commercialized, meaning increased cost to insurers on a per-dose basis. The use of COVID-19 related prevention and treatment may diminish, though, if severe cases continue to be less common. On net, most insurers that publicly quantify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in their filings expect their pandemic-related costs to decrease in 2024, having a small downward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMVP is assuming a 10% reduction in Covid testing costs in the projection period due to a utilization decrease, resulting in the removal of $0.31 PMPM. We expect demand for testing to decrease once cost sharing is reinstituted.\u201d \u2013 MVP Health Care, VT\n\u201cCosts related to COVID-19 decreased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, and have reached a relatively consistent month-to-month level since March 2022. We expect 2023 and 2024 COVID related costs will continue at this lower level and possibly trend slightly downward as population immunity continues to grow.\u201d \u2013 Molina Healthcare of Washington\nThe pandemic had a significant downward effect on utilization of health care generally early on, particularly in 2020, but insurers are expecting a continued return to more normal levels going forward.\n\u201cWhile 2022 trends are lower than 2021, we expect utilization trends to moderate and return to pre-COVID-19 levels over 2023 and 2024.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\nFew insurers mention pent up demand for the non-COVID care that was missed in 2020, and most of those that do mention it say the level of use they are expecting in the remainder of 2023 and 2024 is consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Very few insurers expect pent up demand to drive up costs in 2024.\nUnwinding of Medicaid continuous enrollment\nOn April 1, 2023, states started unwinding the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, resulting in at least 3.8 million people being disenrolled from Medicaid as of August 1, 2023. As a result, some people who have been disenrolled and deemed no longer eligible for Medicaid may enroll in the ACA marketplaces, where they may be eligible for subsidies.\nAbout half of the insurer rate filings reviewed do not mention Medicaid disenrollments in their 2024 premium filings. Those that mention the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage often say the impact on costs is difficult to predict, so they are not adjusting premiums. Several insurers say there will be an increase in their ACA enrollment, but no effect on market morbidity (i.e., the average health of enrollees), meaning no net impact on premiums.\n\u201cOur assumption is that the new members formerly in Medicaid will select a Blue Cross VT plan comparable to the current market share, about 60 percent, resulting in the Blue Cross VT individual market growing by 1,609 members and the Blue Cross VT small group market growing by 1,711 members. We further project that the new Medicaid members will have the same risk score relationship between the carriers as the existing market; therefore, the risk score impact is 1.000 for both carriers.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nA relatively small number of insurers expect the Medicaid unwinding to lead to a sicker group of people signing up for ACA plans, which would then have an upward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMedicaid redetermination and an otherwise shrinking market would lead to an increase in market average morbidity as relatively sicker members will enter and healthier members will leave the market.\u201d \u2013 BridgeSpan Health Company of Oregon\nOther Potential Drivers of Costs\nSome other factors that insurers mentioned in their 2024 rate filings, though much less commonly than the factors described above include:\nDiabetes and Weight Loss Drugs. Diabetic drugs, such as Semaglutide, are increasingly being utilized for weight loss. Given the increasing cost and use of Semaglutide and related drugs, a handful of insurers mention these drugs as having an upward effect on their pharmaceutical spending.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA extends pandemic-era enhanced subsidies through 2025, bringing down premium costs for most consumers in this market. Few insurers mentioned the impact of the IRA subsidies on premiums as there has been no change in the amount of the subsidy from last year.\nOther federal policy changes do not appear to be driving premiums. Among insurer filings reviewed, only one mentioned the impact of new restrictions on surprise billing but reported that no adjustment was made for it.\u00a0 None of the insurers reviewed mentioned the impact of the administrative fix to the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d in their filings.\nDiscussion\nSimilar to last year, it appears that 2024 rates may rise moderately. The median proposed rate increase is 6% nationally, with most proposed increases falling between 2% and 10%. Most enrollees in this market are subsidized and do not pay the full premium. However, premium increases can affect federal spending and the driving factors behind these increases illustrate broader trends driving health costs in 2024.\nA key driver of the increase in premiums in 2024 appears to be rising health prices. While prices for health services tend to grow every year, it also appears that inflation in the rest of the economy may now be starting to flow into the health sector. Rising prices and utilization are not necessarily specific to the ACA individual market. Similar levels of medical trend were observed in small group market filings as well.\nMany insurers that publicly quantified the impacts of the pandemic are projecting a decrease in COVID-19 related costs in 2024. There are multiple factors considered when evaluating the total impact of COVID-19 on costs. Some insurers mentioned higher costs associated with vaccine costs shifting to insurers. Resumed member cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, however, may have a downward effect on premiums as members seek out these services less due to their cost.\nRelative to inflation and the pandemic, fewer insurers mentioned the impact of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, and there was variation in how insurers project its impact on costs. A very small number of insurers mentioned the upward effects of diabetic therapy and weight loss drugs on pharmaceutical trends, mostly pointing to increasing costs and utilization of said drugs. Federal policy changes, like the administrative fix to the Family Glitch and the No Surprises Act, were rarely mentioned by insurers, if at all, despite their potential impacts on enrollment and costs.\nMethods\nProposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov for 320 insurers across 50 states and Washington, DC. Additionally, 58 insurer actuarial memoranda were collected from state rate review websites and were comprehensively reviewed to understand the factors contributing to rate changes. These 58 insurers were from the following Marketplaces: District of Columbia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Insurer actuarial memoranda were systematically evaluated for key words related to, but not limited to, medical trend, COVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency, Medicaid redeterminations, Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, family glitch, surprise billing, telehealth, price transparency, and diabetes or weight loss drugs. Recorded medical trend values reported here are annualized.\nAppendix\nThe Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF\u00a0are partnering to monitor how well the U.S. healthcare system is performing in terms of quality and cost.\nLooking for more data?\nFind out more details about U.S. healthcare from our updated dashboard.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\n\u00a9 2024 PETERSON-KFF Health System Tracker \u00a0 All Rights Reserved",

Contributing factors include growing healthcare costs, stricter payer reimbursement policies, and claims processing errors. Providers are seeing an uptick in nonpayment, plus an added burden on administrative staff, disrupted patient care, and hits to the bottom line.\nExperian Health surveyed over 200 healthcare professionals, primarily in executive or management roles, to better understand the current state of claims. The findings of the State of Claims 2024 report break down the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, reasons for denials, and providers\u2019 concerns about reimbursement.\nRising healthcare costs: who will foot the bill?\nThe U.S. healthcare system is the most expensive in the world, and costs continue to rise. In 2022, healthcare spending reached $4.5 trillion, a threefold increase from $1.4 trillion in 2000. In 2023, costs rose 7.5% to $4.8 trillion. Paying for healthcare is becoming more and more out of reach for patients and causing great concern. Over three-quarters (77%) of providers worry patients will skip out on their medical bills.\nPayer reimbursement challenges are also weighing heavily on healthcare leaders\u2019 minds. More than 75% are worried about nonpayment due to ever-evolving payer policy changes. They also have concerns about the pre-authorization struggles that have continued since 2022, as reported in the State of Claims 2022 survey. Hospitals are particularly feeling the financial pinch of operating within such an expensive environment and face uncertainties about meeting financial obligations on top of other major post-pandemic challenges like staff shortages.\nThe impact of claims denials\nProviders continue to see claims being denied in greater numbers. In 2022, 42% of respondents said denials are increasing. The number jumped to 77% in 2024. Similarly, the time it takes to be reimbursed is increasing, per 67% of respondents. That number was 51% in 2022.\nIn 2024, 84% of healthcare organizations\u00a0will make reducing denied claims a top priority. The Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy reports that the burden of denied claims totals around $260 billion\u00a0annually. The impact of claim denials is far-reaching, affecting the patient experience and revenue cycles. Struggles with claims also burden staff and drain resources, contributing to even more losses.\nThe growing challenge of data collection, verification and authorization\nSuccessful claims processing depends on accuracy. However, achieving accuracy in data collection, verification, and authorization processes remains a continued challenge for claims management teams. Nearly half of respondents (46%) in the State of Claims 2024 report identified missing or inaccurate information as the primary cause for denial. Inaccurate or missing data also creates extra steps in claims processing, resulting in the need for secondary checks and \u201cwasted\u201d healthcare dollars. Survey respondents reported using multiple solutions to collect all the necessary patient data for claims, with some using as many as four different products.\nLeveling the playing field in claims management with technology\nStaying on top of reimbursement requirements and processes is complex, resource-demanding and time-consuming. Inaccuracies commonplace with manual processing exacerbate issues and further extend processing and reimbursement times. However, automation and AI technology have proven effective at reducing claims denials and the burden of manual processing.\n\u201cAdding AI in claims processing cuts down denials significantly,\u201d Tom Bonner, Principal Product Manager at Experian Health, explains. AI automation quickly flags errors, allowing claims editing before payer submission. It\u2019s not science fiction\u2014AI is the tool hospitals need for better healthcare claims denial prevention and management.\u201d\nDuring the pandemic, providers embraced new technology to meet immediate needs; however, that momentum slowed in recent years. In 2022, survey data revealed that 62% of providers were using some form of automation and AI technology. Yet, in 2024, only 31% said they used\u00a0this type of technology.\nHere\u2019s how claims automation can help healthcare organizations improve claims success rates:\n\nManage the entire claims process: Using an automated, scalable claims management system, like ClaimSource\u00ae, helps reduce denials and increase revenue. Providers can manage their entire claims cycle in a single application and ensure claims are clean before submission.\nSubmit more accurate claims: An automated claims submission tool, like ClaimScrubber, helps identify errors that typically result in denials or underpayments before submission. This results in quicker payments, less time chasing aged accounts receivables, and improved cash flow.\nEliminate manual processes: Providers that use Denials Workflow Manager can target claims that need attention immediately, managing denials more effectively and increasing reimbursements significantly.\nImprove cash flow: Enhanced Claim Status helps providers take an early-and-often approach to monitoring claim status in the adjudication process. It eliminates manual follow-up tasks, allowing providers to respond early and accurately to pended, returned-to-provider, denied or zero-pay transactions.\nPrevent denials: Experian Health\u2019s AI Advantage\u2122, an AI-driven platform, uses an organization\u2019s own historical claims data, plus Experian Health\u2019s sophisticated knowledge of payer rules, to continuously learn and adapt to an ever-changing payer policy landscape. This technology helps providers better predict and prevent claims denials, focus on high-priority claims, and boost overall revenue.\n\nAdaptation of technology is likely on the rise with 45% of healthcare leaders planning to invest in automation in the next six months. Over the next year, these investments could pay off if claims denials start to decrease as a result, prompting more healthcare organizations to boost investments in claims management technology.\nDownload the State of Claims 2024 report to get the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, or contact us to learn how Experian Health can help with better claims management.\nGet the report Claims management solutions\n\nPrev\n\nRelated Posts\n\nWhat is revenue cycle management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nThis blog examines revenue cycle management (RCM) in healthcare process as a whole: what it is, how it works, and more.\nPublished: September 10, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nWhat is denial management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nDiscover the importance of healthcare denial management and get strategies to minimize claim denials and improve your financial performance.\nPublished: September 6, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nRevenue cycle management best practices: a guide f...\nFeatured \nDiscover revenue cycle management best practices healthcare leaders should follow to optimize workflows and promote financial stability.\nPublished: August 13, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\nSubscribe to our blog\nEnter your name and email for the latest updates.\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nTags\nai advantage ai advantage denial triage ai advantage predictive denials artificial intelligence automation claim denials claims Claim Scrubber claims management ClaimSource collections Collections Optimization Manager consumer data Coverage Discovery COVID-19 data Data and Analytics digital front door identity management Insurance Eligibility Verification online scheduling patient access patient access curator Patient Collections patient engagement patient estimates patient experience patient financial advisor patient financial clearance patient identity patient payment patient payment estimates patient portal patient registration patient satisfaction patient schedule patientsimple price transparency pymnts registration accelerator Revenue Cycle Management self-scheduling social determinants of health state of claims 2022 state of patient access\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nSubscribe\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\n\nLegal Terms & Conditions\nPrivacy Center\nU.S. Data Privacy Policy\nAd Choices\nPress\nCareers\nInvestor Relations\nContact Us\n\nEXPERIAN'S DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION Learn more how Experian is committed\nDATA PRIVACY Your privacy choices\n\u00a9 2024 Experian Information Solutions, Inc.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Health insurers submit annual rate filings to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans. For 2024, 320 insurers across 50 states and DC propose a median premium increase of 6%. The proposed changes range from a decrease of 15% to an increase of 100%, with most falling between 2% and 10%. These filings are preliminary and subject to change during the rate review process, with final rates expected in late summer.Key drivers of the 2024 premium changes include:1. **Health Spending and Inflation**: Medical trend, which includes growth in prices for medical services and medications, is a significant factor. The median medical trend is 8%, with most insurers reporting trends between 7-9%. Broader economic inflation is also expected to impact health system costs.2. **COVID-19 and the End of the Public Health Emergency**: Insurers expect a decrease in pandemic-related costs in 2024. The end of the Public Health Emergency allows plans to charge cost-sharing for COVID-testing, potentially reducing insurer costs. However, the commercialization of the COVID vaccine may increase costs.3. **Unwinding of Medicaid Continuous Enrollment**: As of August 1, 2023, at least 3.8 million people have been disenrolled from Medicaid. Some may enroll in ACA marketplaces, but the impact on premiums is uncertain. Some insurers expect no significant effect, while a few anticipate an increase in market morbidity.4. **Other Factors**: A few insurers mention the impact of diabetes and weight loss drugs, such as Semaglutide, on pharmaceutical spending. Federal policy changes like the Inflation Reduction Act and the No Surprises Act were rarely mentioned.The analysis includes data from 58 insurers across 11 states and DC, with a median proposed rate increase of 9%. The findings suggest that rising health prices and broader economic inflation are primary drivers of premium increases for 2024. The impact of the pandemic is expected to decrease, while the effects of Medicaid disenrollment and other factors vary among insurers.Methods: Proposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov and state rate review websites. Insurer actuarial memoranda were reviewed for key factors contributing to rate changes, including medical trend, COVID-19, Medicaid redeterminations, and other relevant topics.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Despite increased access to claims management technology, claims denials are still on the rise in 2024. Contributing factors include growing healthcare costs, stricter payer reimbursement policies, and claims processing errors. Providers are seeing an uptick in nonpayment, plus an added burden on administrative staff, disrupted patient care, and hits to the bottom line. Experian Health surveyed over 200 healthcare professionals, primarily in executive or management roles, to better understand the current state of claims. The findings of the State of Claims 2024 report break down the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, reasons for denials, and providers\u2019 concerns about reimbursement. Rising healthcare costs: who will foot the bill? The U.S. healthcare system is the most expensive in the world, and costs continue to rise. In 2022, healthcare spending reached $4.5 trillion, a threefold increase from $1.4 trillion in 2000. In 2023, costs rose 7.5% to $4.8 trillion.

A relatively small share of the population is enrolled in these plans (compared to the number in employer plans), but these filings are generally more detailed and publicly available. These filings provide insight into what factors insurers expect will drive health costs for the coming year.\nFor 2024, across 320 insurers participating in the 50 states and DC, this analysis shows a median proposed premium increase of 6%. Based on a more detailed analysis of publicly available documents from 58 insurers, growth in health care prices stood out as a key factor driving costs in 2024. In addition to inflation, insurers also mention changes in pandemic-related costs and the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage, though the latter are having a small, if any, effect on premiums.\nMost proposed rate increases for 2024 ACA Marketplace plans fall between 2% and 10%, with a median increase of 6%\nAmong 320 ACA Marketplace participating insurers nationally, premium changes range from a drop of \u201315% to an increase of 100%, but most proposed premium changes for 2024 fall between about 2% and 10% (the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively). Of the 320 filings, 41 insurers proposed decreasing premiums. On the other end of the spectrum, 76 insurers requested premium increases greater than 10%. These filings are preliminary and may change during the rate review process. 2024 rates will be finalized in late summer. A table in the appendix shows proposed premium increases by state and insurer.\nThe rate increase for an insurer is a weighted average across all of its products within a state (i.e., bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans). These weighted average premium changes will differ from the percent change in the benchmark silver plan, which is the basis for federal subsidies. Most enrollees in this market receive a subsidy and are not expected to face these premium increases. However, premium increases could result in higher federal spending on subsidies.\nWhat\u2019s driving 2024 premium changes?\nThe chart above shows premium changes for 320 insurers across all 50 states and DC. For the subsequent sections, this analysis focuses on a subset of these rate filings (58 insurers across 11 states and DC) in more detail to understand the factors driving premium changes in 2024. These insurers and states were selected because they have earlier and more transparent (less redacted) public reporting of proposed rate justifications. For context, though, the 58 insurers reviewed in this section have somewhat higher proposed rate increases, with a median of 9%.\nHealth Spending\nHealth & Wellbeing\nInflation\nAs is the case in most years, medical trend \u2013 which includes growth in prices paid by insurers for medical services and medications, as well as growth in the utilization of health care \u2013 is a key driver of premium growth in 2024. Many insurers expect utilization to grow relative to 2022, but price growth is generally playing a larger role in medical trend than utilization is.\nOf the insurer rate filings reviewed in detail, and when an annualized trend was publicly available, the median medical trend was 8%, with most reporting trend in the 7-9% range.\n\u201cThe primary driver of the premium increase is the increases in the cost of healthcare.\u00a0 The increases are associated with increases in the \u201cunit\u201d cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or \u201cutilization\u201d, by members.\u201d \u2013 Anthem Health Plans, Kentucky\nWhile health sector prices typically outpace price growth in the rest of the economy, the last two years have been an exception. Recent medical price growth has been similar to past years, while growth in prices in the rest of the economy has grown at a faster than usual pace. As contracts between insurers and providers are typically negotiated for a year or more, medical inflation often lags that in the rest of the economy.\nLooking ahead to 2024, many insurers are expecting broader economic inflation to flow through to the health system and put upward pressure on premiums.\n\u201cSignificant inflation in the cost of goods and services in all sectors of the economy has had a profound impact on the cost of medical services, and BCBSRI expects to see substantial increases in provider unit costs for 2024.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island\n\u201cWe expect unit cost trends to be higher in 2023 and 2024 due to inflation, supply shortages and labor shortages. Inpatient hospital cost per day trends will be increasing as hospitals seek to recover from 2022 financial losses.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\n\u201cHealth insurance premiums must correspond with the cost of our members\u2019 medical care, which continues to rise at an unparalleled rate year after year and is projected to increase significantly in 2024. Rising medical costs are the primary driver of our proposed individual rates and increase requested premiums by 19.1%.\u201d \u2013 Highmark, New York\nIn addition to driving up prices paid by insurers to providers, inflation is also putting upward pressure on insurers\u2019 administrative costs, such as their own staffing costs.\n\u201cBlue Cross VT is increasing base administrative costs (see section 3.8.7), which has the effect of increasing the premiums by 0.1 percent for individuals and 0.3 percent for small groups. This modest increase reflects current and expected inflationary levels.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nCOVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency\nThis year, as they did in prior years, insurers acknowledge there is still uncertainty surrounding the future of the pandemic. With the end of the Public Health Emergency (PHE) this year, plans can now charge cost sharing for COVID-testing, which could have a downward effect on insurer costs and therefore a downward effect on premiums. Conversely, the COVID vaccine will be commercialized, meaning increased cost to insurers on a per-dose basis. The use of COVID-19 related prevention and treatment may diminish, though, if severe cases continue to be less common. On net, most insurers that publicly quantify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in their filings expect their pandemic-related costs to decrease in 2024, having a small downward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMVP is assuming a 10% reduction in Covid testing costs in the projection period due to a utilization decrease, resulting in the removal of $0.31 PMPM. We expect demand for testing to decrease once cost sharing is reinstituted.\u201d \u2013 MVP Health Care, VT\n\u201cCosts related to COVID-19 decreased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, and have reached a relatively consistent month-to-month level since March 2022. We expect 2023 and 2024 COVID related costs will continue at this lower level and possibly trend slightly downward as population immunity continues to grow.\u201d \u2013 Molina Healthcare of Washington\nThe pandemic had a significant downward effect on utilization of health care generally early on, particularly in 2020, but insurers are expecting a continued return to more normal levels going forward.\n\u201cWhile 2022 trends are lower than 2021, we expect utilization trends to moderate and return to pre-COVID-19 levels over 2023 and 2024.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\nFew insurers mention pent up demand for the non-COVID care that was missed in 2020, and most of those that do mention it say the level of use they are expecting in the remainder of 2023 and 2024 is consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Very few insurers expect pent up demand to drive up costs in 2024.\nUnwinding of Medicaid continuous enrollment\nOn April 1, 2023, states started unwinding the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, resulting in at least 3.8 million people being disenrolled from Medicaid as of August 1, 2023. As a result, some people who have been disenrolled and deemed no longer eligible for Medicaid may enroll in the ACA marketplaces, where they may be eligible for subsidies.\nAbout half of the insurer rate filings reviewed do not mention Medicaid disenrollments in their 2024 premium filings. Those that mention the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage often say the impact on costs is difficult to predict, so they are not adjusting premiums. Several insurers say there will be an increase in their ACA enrollment, but no effect on market morbidity (i.e., the average health of enrollees), meaning no net impact on premiums.\n\u201cOur assumption is that the new members formerly in Medicaid will select a Blue Cross VT plan comparable to the current market share, about 60 percent, resulting in the Blue Cross VT individual market growing by 1,609 members and the Blue Cross VT small group market growing by 1,711 members. We further project that the new Medicaid members will have the same risk score relationship between the carriers as the existing market; therefore, the risk score impact is 1.000 for both carriers.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nA relatively small number of insurers expect the Medicaid unwinding to lead to a sicker group of people signing up for ACA plans, which would then have an upward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMedicaid redetermination and an otherwise shrinking market would lead to an increase in market average morbidity as relatively sicker members will enter and healthier members will leave the market.\u201d \u2013 BridgeSpan Health Company of Oregon\nOther Potential Drivers of Costs\nSome other factors that insurers mentioned in their 2024 rate filings, though much less commonly than the factors described above include:\nDiabetes and Weight Loss Drugs. Diabetic drugs, such as Semaglutide, are increasingly being utilized for weight loss. Given the increasing cost and use of Semaglutide and related drugs, a handful of insurers mention these drugs as having an upward effect on their pharmaceutical spending.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA extends pandemic-era enhanced subsidies through 2025, bringing down premium costs for most consumers in this market. Few insurers mentioned the impact of the IRA subsidies on premiums as there has been no change in the amount of the subsidy from last year.\nOther federal policy changes do not appear to be driving premiums. Among insurer filings reviewed, only one mentioned the impact of new restrictions on surprise billing but reported that no adjustment was made for it.\u00a0 None of the insurers reviewed mentioned the impact of the administrative fix to the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d in their filings.\nDiscussion\nSimilar to last year, it appears that 2024 rates may rise moderately. The median proposed rate increase is 6% nationally, with most proposed increases falling between 2% and 10%. Most enrollees in this market are subsidized and do not pay the full premium. However, premium increases can affect federal spending and the driving factors behind these increases illustrate broader trends driving health costs in 2024.\nA key driver of the increase in premiums in 2024 appears to be rising health prices. While prices for health services tend to grow every year, it also appears that inflation in the rest of the economy may now be starting to flow into the health sector. Rising prices and utilization are not necessarily specific to the ACA individual market. Similar levels of medical trend were observed in small group market filings as well.\nMany insurers that publicly quantified the impacts of the pandemic are projecting a decrease in COVID-19 related costs in 2024. There are multiple factors considered when evaluating the total impact of COVID-19 on costs. Some insurers mentioned higher costs associated with vaccine costs shifting to insurers. Resumed member cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, however, may have a downward effect on premiums as members seek out these services less due to their cost.\nRelative to inflation and the pandemic, fewer insurers mentioned the impact of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, and there was variation in how insurers project its impact on costs. A very small number of insurers mentioned the upward effects of diabetic therapy and weight loss drugs on pharmaceutical trends, mostly pointing to increasing costs and utilization of said drugs. Federal policy changes, like the administrative fix to the Family Glitch and the No Surprises Act, were rarely mentioned by insurers, if at all, despite their potential impacts on enrollment and costs.\nMethods\nProposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov for 320 insurers across 50 states and Washington, DC. Additionally, 58 insurer actuarial memoranda were collected from state rate review websites and were comprehensively reviewed to understand the factors contributing to rate changes. These 58 insurers were from the following Marketplaces: District of Columbia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Insurer actuarial memoranda were systematically evaluated for key words related to, but not limited to, medical trend, COVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency, Medicaid redeterminations, Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, family glitch, surprise billing, telehealth, price transparency, and diabetes or weight loss drugs. Recorded medical trend values reported here are annualized.\nAppendix\nThe Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF\u00a0are partnering to monitor how well the U.S. healthcare system is performing in terms of quality and cost.\nLooking for more data?\nFind out more details about U.S. healthcare from our updated dashboard.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\n\u00a9 2024 PETERSON-KFF Health System Tracker \u00a0 All Rights Reserved",

Contributing factors include growing healthcare costs, stricter payer reimbursement policies, and claims processing errors. Providers are seeing an uptick in nonpayment, plus an added burden on administrative staff, disrupted patient care, and hits to the bottom line.\nExperian Health surveyed over 200 healthcare professionals, primarily in executive or management roles, to better understand the current state of claims. The findings of the State of Claims 2024 report break down the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, reasons for denials, and providers\u2019 concerns about reimbursement.\nRising healthcare costs: who will foot the bill?\nThe U.S. healthcare system is the most expensive in the world, and costs continue to rise. In 2022, healthcare spending reached $4.5 trillion, a threefold increase from $1.4 trillion in 2000. In 2023, costs rose 7.5% to $4.8 trillion. Paying for healthcare is becoming more and more out of reach for patients and causing great concern. Over three-quarters (77%) of providers worry patients will skip out on their medical bills.\nPayer reimbursement challenges are also weighing heavily on healthcare leaders\u2019 minds. More than 75% are worried about nonpayment due to ever-evolving payer policy changes. They also have concerns about the pre-authorization struggles that have continued since 2022, as reported in the State of Claims 2022 survey. Hospitals are particularly feeling the financial pinch of operating within such an expensive environment and face uncertainties about meeting financial obligations on top of other major post-pandemic challenges like staff shortages.\nThe impact of claims denials\nProviders continue to see claims being denied in greater numbers. In 2022, 42% of respondents said denials are increasing. The number jumped to 77% in 2024. Similarly, the time it takes to be reimbursed is increasing, per 67% of respondents. That number was 51% in 2022.\nIn 2024, 84% of healthcare organizations\u00a0will make reducing denied claims a top priority. The Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy reports that the burden of denied claims totals around $260 billion\u00a0annually. The impact of claim denials is far-reaching, affecting the patient experience and revenue cycles. Struggles with claims also burden staff and drain resources, contributing to even more losses.\nThe growing challenge of data collection, verification and authorization\nSuccessful claims processing depends on accuracy. However, achieving accuracy in data collection, verification, and authorization processes remains a continued challenge for claims management teams. Nearly half of respondents (46%) in the State of Claims 2024 report identified missing or inaccurate information as the primary cause for denial. Inaccurate or missing data also creates extra steps in claims processing, resulting in the need for secondary checks and \u201cwasted\u201d healthcare dollars. Survey respondents reported using multiple solutions to collect all the necessary patient data for claims, with some using as many as four different products.\nLeveling the playing field in claims management with technology\nStaying on top of reimbursement requirements and processes is complex, resource-demanding and time-consuming. Inaccuracies commonplace with manual processing exacerbate issues and further extend processing and reimbursement times. However, automation and AI technology have proven effective at reducing claims denials and the burden of manual processing.\n\u201cAdding AI in claims processing cuts down denials significantly,\u201d Tom Bonner, Principal Product Manager at Experian Health, explains. AI automation quickly flags errors, allowing claims editing before payer submission. It\u2019s not science fiction\u2014AI is the tool hospitals need for better healthcare claims denial prevention and management.\u201d\nDuring the pandemic, providers embraced new technology to meet immediate needs; however, that momentum slowed in recent years. In 2022, survey data revealed that 62% of providers were using some form of automation and AI technology. Yet, in 2024, only 31% said they used\u00a0this type of technology.\nHere\u2019s how claims automation can help healthcare organizations improve claims success rates:\n\nManage the entire claims process: Using an automated, scalable claims management system, like ClaimSource\u00ae, helps reduce denials and increase revenue. Providers can manage their entire claims cycle in a single application and ensure claims are clean before submission.\nSubmit more accurate claims: An automated claims submission tool, like ClaimScrubber, helps identify errors that typically result in denials or underpayments before submission. This results in quicker payments, less time chasing aged accounts receivables, and improved cash flow.\nEliminate manual processes: Providers that use Denials Workflow Manager can target claims that need attention immediately, managing denials more effectively and increasing reimbursements significantly.\nImprove cash flow: Enhanced Claim Status helps providers take an early-and-often approach to monitoring claim status in the adjudication process. It eliminates manual follow-up tasks, allowing providers to respond early and accurately to pended, returned-to-provider, denied or zero-pay transactions.\nPrevent denials: Experian Health\u2019s AI Advantage\u2122, an AI-driven platform, uses an organization\u2019s own historical claims data, plus Experian Health\u2019s sophisticated knowledge of payer rules, to continuously learn and adapt to an ever-changing payer policy landscape. This technology helps providers better predict and prevent claims denials, focus on high-priority claims, and boost overall revenue.\n\nAdaptation of technology is likely on the rise with 45% of healthcare leaders planning to invest in automation in the next six months. Over the next year, these investments could pay off if claims denials start to decrease as a result, prompting more healthcare organizations to boost investments in claims management technology.\nDownload the State of Claims 2024 report to get the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, or contact us to learn how Experian Health can help with better claims management.\nGet the report Claims management solutions\n\nPrev\n\nRelated Posts\n\nWhat is revenue cycle management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nThis blog examines revenue cycle management (RCM) in healthcare process as a whole: what it is, how it works, and more.\nPublished: September 10, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nWhat is denial management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nDiscover the importance of healthcare denial management and get strategies to minimize claim denials and improve your financial performance.\nPublished: September 6, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nRevenue cycle management best practices: a guide f...\nFeatured \nDiscover revenue cycle management best practices healthcare leaders should follow to optimize workflows and promote financial stability.\nPublished: August 13, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\nSubscribe to our blog\nEnter your name and email for the latest updates.\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nTags\nai advantage ai advantage denial triage ai advantage predictive denials artificial intelligence automation claim denials claims Claim Scrubber claims management ClaimSource collections Collections Optimization Manager consumer data Coverage Discovery COVID-19 data Data and Analytics digital front door identity management Insurance Eligibility Verification online scheduling patient access patient access curator Patient Collections patient engagement patient estimates patient experience patient financial advisor patient financial clearance patient identity patient payment patient payment estimates patient portal patient registration patient satisfaction patient schedule patientsimple price transparency pymnts registration accelerator Revenue Cycle Management self-scheduling social determinants of health state of claims 2022 state of patient access\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nSubscribe\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\n\nLegal Terms & Conditions\nPrivacy Center\nU.S. Data Privacy Policy\nAd Choices\nPress\nCareers\nInvestor Relations\nContact Us\n\nEXPERIAN'S DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION Learn more how Experian is committed\nDATA PRIVACY Your privacy choices\n\u00a9 2024 Experian Information Solutions, Inc.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Health insurers submit annual rate filings to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans. For 2024, 320 insurers across 50 states and DC propose a median premium increase of 6%. The proposed changes range from a decrease of 15% to an increase of 100%, with most falling between 2% and 10%. These filings are preliminary and subject to change during the rate review process, with final rates expected in late summer.Key drivers of the 2024 premium changes include:1. **Health Spending and Inflation**: Medical trend, which includes growth in prices for medical services and medications, is a significant factor. The median medical trend is 8%, with most insurers reporting trends between 7-9%. Broader economic inflation is also expected to impact health system costs.2. **COVID-19 and the End of the Public Health Emergency**: Insurers expect a decrease in pandemic-related costs in 2024. The end of the Public Health Emergency allows plans to charge cost-sharing for COVID-testing, potentially reducing insurer costs. However, the commercialization of the COVID vaccine may increase costs.3. **Unwinding of Medicaid Continuous Enrollment**: As of August 1, 2023, at least 3.8 million people have been disenrolled from Medicaid. Some may enroll in ACA marketplaces, but the impact on premiums is uncertain. Some insurers expect no significant effect, while a few anticipate an increase in market morbidity.4. **Other Factors**: A few insurers mention the impact of diabetes and weight loss drugs, such as Semaglutide, on pharmaceutical spending. Federal policy changes like the Inflation Reduction Act and the No Surprises Act were rarely mentioned.The analysis includes data from 58 insurers across 11 states and DC, with a median proposed rate increase of 9%. The findings suggest that rising health prices and broader economic inflation are primary drivers of premium increases for 2024. The impact of the pandemic is expected to decrease, while the effects of Medicaid disenrollment and other factors vary among insurers.Methods: Proposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov and state rate review websites. Insurer actuarial memoranda were reviewed for key factors contributing to rate changes, including medical trend, COVID-19, Medicaid redeterminations, and other relevant topics.",

Unfortunately, chemotherapy is associated with a number of potentially life-threatening side effects. There is a need to ameliorate chemotoxicity to improve therapeutic outcomes and quality of life. Chemotoxicity arises from systemic DNA damage and inflammation in healthy cells due to chemotherapy drugs. Traditionally, these processes are believed to be caused by the direct death of normal cells by chemotherapeutic drugs. However, new research has challenged this dogma by suggesting that chemotoxicity is a secondary effect associated with the release of cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) from cells subjected to drug-induced death. Released cfChPs can freely enter into bystander healthy cells to inflict double-strand (dsDNA) breaks and activate inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. The drug-induced cell death and cfChPs release have cascading effects that exaggerate and prolong chemotoxicity. Furthermore, evidence has emerged from laboratory and preclinical studies, and two phase II clinical trials, indicating that chemotoxicity can be minimised by deactivating cfChPs. Three cfChPs-deactivating agents have been identified, of which the nutraceutical combination resveratrol and copper (R\u2013Cu)\u2014easily administered orally and with little toxicity\u2014is the agent of choice for human therapeutic use. This article aims to provide practising medical oncologists with a perspective on this emerging research on chemotoxicity and its prevention and its potential implications for the future. Well-designed randomised clinical trials will be necessary to establish the true clinical value of these findings in day-to-day practice.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nThe thioredoxin system determines CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity via redox-mediated regulation of ribonucleotide reductase activity\n                                        \n\n\nThe dual role of ferroptosis in anthracycline-based chemotherapy includes reducing resistance and increasing toxicity\n                                        \n\n\nNatural products: potential treatments for cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity\n                                        \n\nIntroduction\nGlobally, over 19 million new cancer cases are detected annually [1]. Most individuals diagnosed with cancer receive some form of chemotherapy, with or without additional treatment, and experience varying degrees of toxic side effects. Indeed, the clinical spectrum of toxicities is vast, ranging from less severe toxicities, such as nausea, vomiting, dysgeusia, and hair loss, to those that are more serious and potentially life-threatening including myelosuppression, febrile neutropenia, severe oral mucositis, and sepsis [2, 3]. In addition to these acute toxicities, several late effects are associated with chemotherapy, involving the cardiac [4, 5], neurological [6], renal [7], pulmonary [8], and hepatic systems [9]. Estimates indicate that more than a quarter of patients receiving conventional chemotherapy experience severe (grade IV) potentially life-threatening toxicities [10]. Several therapies are prescribed to mitigate the toxic effects of chemotherapy, with variable success rates.\nChemotherapy-induced toxicity results from systemic DNA damage and inflammation in healthy cells [11], traditionally believed to be caused by the direct death of normal cells by chemotherapeutic drugs [12]. However, recent research has challenged this belief by suggesting a novel mechanism of chemotoxicity involving cfChPs that are released from cells subjected to drug-induced death [13,14,15], with evidence indicating that the toxicity of chemotherapy can be minimised by deactivating cfChPs [16]. This evidence has been sourced from laboratory studies at the cellular level, pre-clinical animal studies, and clinical trials in patients with cancer, each of which is discussed in detail below.\nLaboratory studies\nThe mechanism of the bystander effect, which is characterised by damage to non-targeted and often distant cells in association with chemotherapy (and radiotherapy) [16, 17], has perplexed scientists for decades. For example, when Adriamycin-killed lymphocytic leukaemia (Jurkat) cells were co-cultured with normal NIH3T3 cells, the bystander NIH3T3 cells showed upregulation of markers of DNA damage, DNA repair, and apoptosis in the form of increased expression of phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX), phosphorylated ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein (p-ATM), and caspase-3, respectively; pro-inflammatory markers, including NF-\u03baB, TNF\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-6, also showed notable upregulation [14]. When experiments in the same study were performed using dead Jurkat cells that had been pre-labelled with the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) prior to Adriamycin treatment, numerous BrdU-labelled fluorescent particles representing DNA were found to have accumulated in the nuclei of NIH3T3 cells. This indicated the involvement of cfChPs released from dying Jurkat cells in the aforementioned bystander effect. The phenomenon of chemotherapy-induced bystander effect is pictorially depicted in Fig.\u00a01. During experiments conducted in vivo, in which chemotherapy-induced dying cancer cells were intravenously injected into mice, activation of H2AX and NF-\u03baB was observed in the cells of the brain, liver, and lung in association with the integration of cfChPs released from the dying cells into the genomes of cells of these distant organs [14]. The bystander effects were eliminated following the concurrent use of three different cfChPs-deactivating agents: anti-histone antibody complexed nanoparticles (CNPs) [18], DNAse I, and a combination of the nutraceuticals R\u2013Cu [14]. The latter findings incriminated cfChPs in the pathophysiology of the bystander effect in vivo.\na MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were dually fluorescently labelled in their DNA with BrdU and in their histones with H2B-GFP according to a method described by us earlier [15] The dually labelled cells were treated with Adriamycin for 48\u2009h and the dead cells were mixed with healthy NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells at a ratio of 1:30 and plated on coverslips in a culture dish. After 24\u2009h of incubation, the cells were fixed and examined by fluorescent microscopy. The dead MDA-MB-231 cell is marked with an arrow. Dually labelled cfChPs are clearly detected in bystander NIH3T3 cells. b B16F10 mouse melanoma cells were pre-labelled in their DNA with BrdU and killed with Adriamycin. The dying cells were mixed with normal NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells at a ratio of 1:30 and plated on coverslips on a petri dish. After 24\u2009h of incubation, the cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against BrdU and \u03b3H2AX. BrdU-labelled DNA particles from the dying B16F10 melanoma cell (marked with arrow) are clearly seen in bystander NIH3T3 cells which co-localise with \u03b3H2AX signals indicating dsDNA breaks in them.\nCell-free chromatin particles are also involved in the radiation-induced bystander effect. When NIH3T3 cells were treated with conditioned media obtained from irradiated cells, the upregulation of \u03b3H2AX, NF-\u03baB, IL-6, and active caspase-3 were clearly observed [15]. There was also evidence of large-scale chromosomal aberrations including dicentric, acentric, fusion, and Robertsonian fusion chromosomes. The above bystander effects were abrogated when the conditioned medium was pre-treated with CNPs, DNase I, or R-Cu. In the same study, radiation treatment also led to systemic bystander effects; irradiation of the lower hemi-body of mice with \u03b3-rays (10\u2009Gy) led to the activation of H2AX, NF\u03baB, IL-6, and active caspase-3 in brain cells [15]. Activation of these bystander biomarkers was abrogated by concurrent treatment with CNPs, DNase I, and R-Cu, thereby directly implicating cfChPs in systemic bystander effects [15].\nActivity and bystander effects of cfChPs\nCell-free chromatin particles released from chemotherapy-induced dying cells are apparently phagocytosed by bystander healthy cells. This was revealed by the micro-array analysis performed following co-culture of dying cells with healthy cells, which showed upregulation of pathways related to phagocytosis at 6\u2009h [14]. The internalised cfChPs were found to integrate into the genomes of the host cells as confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis, and the identification of many human Alu elements in the recipient cells [13, 14]. Genomic integration led to dsDNA breaks and activation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways [13, 14] which are the critical elements of the bystander effect.\nPreclinical studies\nPreclinical animal studies using the abovementioned cfChPs-deactivating agents have shown great promise [16]. Mice (5 per group) injected with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (Adriamycin) demonstrated a surge in the release of cfChPs from dying cells into the bloodstream, accompanied by an upsurge of inflammatory cytokines C-reactive protein, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 [16]. All values were highly significant when compared with untreated controls with p values ranging between <0.01 and <0.0001. Although the timing of these effects can vary, the most significant upregulation of NF-\u03baB, IL-6, active caspase-3, and \u03b3-H2AX is typically seen 18\u2009h following chemotherapy. Blood collected following chemotherapy administration from mice treated with the three cfChPs-deactivating agents, viz. CNPs, DNAse I, and R-Cu led to significant downregulation of the inflammatory cytokines compared with untreated controls with p values ranging between >0.05 and >0.0001 [16]. When the Adriamycin-treated mice were dissected and their organs were examined for markers of DNA damage, apoptosis, and inflammation, a remarkable downregulation of the activated \u03b3H2AX, caspase-3, NF-\u03baB, and IL-6 was observed with values that were almost identical to those in controls not treated with doxorubicin (p values ranging between >0.01 and >0.0001) [16]. These effects were observed in multiple organs, including the lungs, liver, heart, brain, ovaries, skin, and small intestine (Fig.\u00a02). Identical results were observed in association with the administration of other chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, methotrexate, and paclitaxel, with a significant downregulation of \u03b3H2AX and NF-\u03baB in the brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cells following the use of cfChPs-deactivating agents. Furthermore, the occurrence of potentially life-threatening neutropenia was also significantly reduced with the concurrent use of neutralising agents [16]. Following the administration of a lethal dose of doxorubicin (20\u2009mg/kg), the overall survival of mice (10 in each group) was also significantly prolonged using cfChPs-deactivating agents, with some mice surviving the lethal dose of doxorubicin with p values ranging between >0.05 and >0.0001 [16].\nThe bars represent the mean values of five animals in each group. Statistical comparisons were carried out using unpaired Student\u2019s t-tests. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM values of all groups were significantly lower than that of the doxorubicin group, with p values ranging between <0.01 and <0.0001 (reproduced with permission from [16] with modification).\nThe chemotoxicity enigma\nOne particularly puzzling aspect of chemotoxicity is its chronology. Although the half-life of most chemotherapy drugs is approximately 24\u2009h [19], their toxic side effects last for 2\u20133 weeks. For example, chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression reaches a nadir after 7\u201314 days, and the ensuing neutropenia often takes more than 3 weeks to recover. Similarly, chemotherapy-associated oral mucositis typically begins 5\u20137 days after initiating chemotherapy [20]. The results discussed above may help elucidate on the nature of this conundrum. Specifically, the aforementioned findings suggest that DNA damage, apoptosis, and inflammation directly resulting from the action of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) are minimal, and most toxic side effects are induced by cfChPs that are released from the initial round of drug-induced cell death. The latter mechanism sets in motion a cascading effect, whereby dying cells release more cfChPs, leading to a vicious cycle of further DNA damage, apoptosis, and inflammation in bystander cells, thereby amplifying and prolonging the toxic effects of chemotherapy. The vicious cycle of cascading bystander cell death resulting from chemotherapy treatment is illustrated in Fig.\u00a03.\nChemotherapy induced cell death sets in motion a vicious cycle of more cell death triggered by cfChPs released from dying cells. The vicious cycle can be broken by oxygen radicals generated by a combination of resveratrol with copper.\nResveratrol\u2013copper and its mechanism of action\nOf the three deactivating agents for cfChPs that have been previously utilised in preclinical studies, namely, CNPs, DNAse I, and R-Cu, the latter has been proven to be the agent of choice for therapeutic use in humans [21]. This is primarily because R-Cu can be easily administered orally and has demonstrated little toxicity in preclinical and clinical studies, even after prolonged administration [22]. Resveratrol (R) is a nutraceutical that has been extensively studied because of its antioxidant properties [23]. However, it acts as a prooxidant in the presence of copper (Cu), another widely researched nutraceutical [24]. R catalyses the reduction of Cu (II) to Cu (I), resulting in the generation of oxygen radicals via a Fenton-like reaction (Fig.\u00a04) [25]. The oxygen radicals thus generated have previously been shown to be capable of cleaving plasmid pBR322 DNA [26, 27]. It was subsequently demonstrated that a combination of R and Cu can degrade genomic DNA and RNA [28] and can also deactivate cfChPs by degrading their DNA components [15, 16, 29]. Paradoxically, it has also been found that the DNA-degrading activity of R-Cu increases with a reduction in the molar concentration of Cu [28]. This finding has led to the establishment of the concentrations of R and Cu used in the clinical studies described below, wherein the molar ratio of R to Cu is maintained at 1:10-4.\nResveratrol catalyses the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I); the latter reacts with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH-), and a hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) and also regenerates Cu(II) in a cyclic manner.

Utilising R-Cu as an essential deactivator of cfChPs formed the foundation of two phase II clinical trials [30, 31]. The first study was a dose-escalation pilot study in which 25 patients with multiple myeloma receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were enrolled. Five patients formed the control group and the remaining 20 were administered one of two different doses of R-Cu (R\u2009=\u20095.6\u2009mg and Cu = 560\u2009ng, or R\u2009=\u200950\u2009mg and Cu = 5\u2009\u03bcg, both administered orally twice daily) 48\u2009h before melphalan chemotherapy, continuing a twice-daily dose of R-Cu until 21 days post-transplantation [30]. The primary objective was to evaluate the immediate post-BMT toxicities, namely mucositis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, the requirement of opioids, and the need for total parenteral nutrition. An objective evaluation of inflammation was performed by measuring the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum and saliva. The study found a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of grade 3 mucositis and the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The incidence of grade III/IV oral mucositis was 100% in the control group versus 40% in the R-Cu groups (p\u2009=\u20090.039). Other adverse effects and cytokine levels showed non-significant reduction.\nAnother prospective open-label phase II single\u2011arm study was conducted to check for reduced haematological and non-haematological toxicities in 30 patients with advanced gastric cancer following docetaxel-based multi-agent chemotherapy [31]. Patients received R-Cu (dosage: R\u2009=\u20095.6\u2009mg and Cu = 560\u2009ng) orally thrice daily concurrently with chemotherapy for 6 months or until evidence of disease progression, whichever occurred sooner. Although the cumulative incidence of overall and haematological toxicity declined, this failed to reach statistical significance. However, the incidence of more troublesome non-haematological toxicities, such as hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea, and vomiting, was dramatically reduced in the R-Cu group compared to a historical cohort.\nEffect of R-Cu on tumour cells\nIn addition to the role of R-Cu in minimising chemotoxicity, it may have potential therapeutic effects on tumour cells. The oxygen radicals that are generated by the R-Cu combination not only deactivate extracellular cfChPs to prevent the damaging bystander effects of chemotherapy, but they can also enter into the tumour to deactivate intratumoural cfChPs that are derived from dying cancer cells. A recent study in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC) detected the copious presence of cfChPs in the tumour microenvironment (TME) derived from dying cancer cells, which were eradicated following 2 weeks of twice-daily oral administration of R-Cu [32]. Eradication of cfChPs from TME was accompanied by marked downregulation of 23 biomarkers representing 10 hallmarks of cancer, including 5 immune checkpoints, defined by Hanahan and Weinberg [33] with p values ranging between >0.063 and >0.000. This study suggested that cfChPs from dying cancer cells are global instigators of cancer hallmarks in surviving cancer cells and raised the hypothesis that prolonged treatment with R-Cu may lead to the reversal of the malignant phenotype of cancer [32].\nConclusion\nOncological treatments can cause a range of adverse effects associated with morbidity and mortality independent of the underlying cancer. Advances in our knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chemotoxicity are essential to facilitate the development of effective treatments that improve the outcomes and quality of life of patients with cancer. Collectively, the laboratory, animal, and clinical studies described in this article corroborate the hypothesis implicating cfChPs in \u201cbystander effect\u201d chemotoxicity, as well as the role of R-Cu as a potent cfChPs-deactivating agent. Larger clinical studies with greater statistical power may further clarify the reduction in the incidence of various toxicities associated with the use of R-Cu and facilitate our understanding of additional pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, a greater focus on studying the cellular response to cfChPs may reveal novel mechanisms of toxicity associated with oncological treatments and further our understanding of the management of the adverse effects of chemotherapy.\nData availability\nAll data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and the cited studies.\nReferences\nFerlay J, Colombet M, Soerjomataram I, Parkin DM, Pi\u00f1eros M, Znaor A, et al.

    "Document2": "Heart disease and stroke could affect at least 60% of adults in U.S. by 2050\nBy American Heart Association News\nAt least 6 in 10 adults in an older, more diverse U.S. population could be affected by cardiovascular disease within the next 30 years, according to two new science reports.\nThe projected rise in heart disease and stroke \u2013 along with several key risk factors, including high blood pressure and obesity \u2013 is likely to triple related costs to $1.8 trillion by 2050, according to two American Heart Association presidential advisories published Tuesday in the AHA journal Circulation. One report looks at the projected increase in cardiovascular disease rates in the decades ahead, while the other projects their total related costs.\n\"The landscape of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. is seeing the arrival of a near-perfect storm,\" Dr. Dhruv S. Kazi, vice chair of the advisory writing group, said in a news release. Kazi is head of health economics and associate director of the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology and director of the cardiac critical care unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\"The last decade has seen a surge of cardiovascular risk factors such as uncontrolled high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, each of which raises the risks of developing heart disease and stroke,\" he said. \"It is not surprising that an enormous increase in cardiovascular risk factors and diseases will produce a substantial economic burden.\"\nCardiovascular disease refers to conditions such as coronary heart disease, including heart attacks; heart failure, which is when the heart doesn't pump as well as it should; heart arrhythmias, including a type of irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation; vascular disease, which affects the veins and arteries; congenital heart defects; stroke; and high blood pressure.\nBecause high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, contributes to nearly all types of heart disease and stroke, researchers made separate predictions for this condition. According to their projections, from 2020 to 2050, high blood pressure is expected to rise from 51.2% to 61% of the U.S. population.\nExcluding people with high blood pressure, researchers project 15% of the population will have developed cardiovascular disease by 2050, up from 11.3% in 2020. This includes a doubling of stroke rates.\nObesity rates are expected to climb from 43.1% to 60.6% of the population, with adults ages 20 to 64 expected to see the highest growth because of unhealthy diets.\nThe diabetes rate is expected to rise from 16.3% to 26.8% of the population.\nRisk factors are rising even among children and young adults.\nBy 2050, obesity is expected to affect a third of all children, up from 20% in 2020. The highest increases are expected among children 2 to 5 years old and 12 to 19. Contributing factors, such as insufficient physical activity and a poor diet, are expected to remain as high as 60% of all children over the next three decades.\nKazi said disease rates are climbing at a time of pivotal demographic shifts.\n\"The last of the Baby Boomers will hit 65 in 2030, so about 1 in 5 people in the U.S. will be over 65, outnumbering children for the first time in U.S. history,\" he said. \"Since cardiovascular risk increases with age, the aging population increases the total burden of cardiovascular disease in the country.\"\nResearchers anticipate the Hispanic, Asian and multiracial populations in the U.S. will more than double in the coming decades.\n\"By 2060, more than two-thirds of children will belong to underserved, disenfranchised populations, which traditionally have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and risk factors,\" Kazi said.\nAccording to the projections, the biggest rise in the total number of people with cardiovascular disease will be among Hispanic adults, with Asian adults also seeing a large increase. Black adults are projected to have the highest rates of high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, as well as the highest rates of inadequate sleep and poor diets. Asian adults are projected to have the highest rates of inadequate physical activity, with rates also high among Asian and Hispanic children.\nHispanic children are projected to have the highest obesity rates, along with the greatest projected growth in obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. Black children are expected to have the highest overall rates of high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\"We found larger increases in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and risk factors, and in the number of people with these conditions, among people from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds,\" Dr. Karen E. Joynt Maddox, chair of the writing committee, said in the release. She is an associate professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. While some of the increase is due to U.S. demographic shifts, much of the inequity in cardiovascular disease and risk factors \"remains attributed to systemic racism, as well as socioeconomic factors and access to care,\" she said.\nThe researchers did find some positive trends. Overall, the percentage of people who don't get enough physical activity is expected to drop, from 33.5% to 24.2% of the population. And smoking rates are expected to drop by nearly half, from 15.8% to 8.4% of the population.\nThe writing committee noted that aggressive approaches to reducing cardiovascular risk factors could alter some of these predictions. Any reductions in disease could help lower costs, Kazi said.\n\"We can bend the cost curve on cardiovascular disease, but this will require strategic investments in cardiovascular prevention and treatment,\" he said. \"It will take all of us working together to make this happen.\"\nAmerican Heart Association News Stories\nCopyright is owned or held by the American Heart Association, Inc., and all rights are reserved.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Most patients with cancer receive chemotherapy, which is associated with potentially life-threatening side effects due to systemic DNA damage and inflammation in healthy cells. Recent research suggests that chemotoxicity is a secondary effect caused by cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) released from drug-induced cell death. These cfChPs can enter healthy cells, causing DNA breaks and activating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Deactivating cfChPs with agents like resveratrol and copper (R\u2013Cu) can minimize chemotoxicity. Laboratory and preclinical studies, as well as two phase II clinical trials, support this approach. In laboratory studies, cfChPs released from dying cells caused DNA damage and inflammation in bystander cells, which was mitigated by cfChPs-deactivating agents. Preclinical studies in mice showed that cfChPs-deactivating agents reduced inflammatory cytokines and markers of DNA damage and apoptosis in multiple organs. Clinical trials with R-Cu showed reduced incidence of severe oral mucositis and other toxicities in patients undergoing chemotherapy. The combination of resveratrol and copper generates oxygen radicals that degrade cfChPs, potentially reducing chemotoxicity and improving patient outcomes. Larger clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings and further understand the mechanisms of chemotoxicity.",

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

The rising demand for antidepressant drugs affects market prices as well. Patients may find antidepressants to be more affordable because many of them are available in generic form.\u00a0\nWhich Region is Expanding at the Fastest CAGR?\nAsia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth in the antidepressant drugs market during the forecast period. Changes in the financial system, societal norms, and lifestyle might increase the likelihood of mental health issues like depression, which in turn drives up the need for antidepressant drugs.

The market will grow if government initiatives are implemented to provide access to basic treatment for all mental health conditions. Additionally, the market is growing due to growing sales of CNS stimulants, an increase in the number of persons experiencing stress, and growing awareness about the illness state and necessary treatment needs.\r\n\u00a0\nThe current report Scope analyzes Antidepressant Drugs Market on 5 major region Split (In case you wish to acquire a specific region edition (more granular data) or any country Edition data then please write us on info@cognitivemarketresearch.com\n\nNorth America (United States, Canada, Mexico)\nEurope (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium)\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Rest of APAC)\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Rest of South America)\nMiddle East and Africa (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nigeria, UAE, Egypt, South Africa, GCC Countries, Rest of MEA)\n\n\n\nAntidepressant Drugs Market Share (%) by Region (2019-2031)\n\n\nThe above graph is for illustrative purposes only.

    "Document2": "New COVID vaccines are here. What to know about latest shots in wake of nation\u2019s biggest summer surge\nOn the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers.\nBack in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early.\nManufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use.\nIn considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants.\n\u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d\nWho can get a new COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children:\nAdults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults.\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses.\nI recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine?\nYes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months.\nHowever, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area.\nI just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one?\nFor people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician.\nIf you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated.\nAre the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same?\nBoth use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them.\nComirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nSpikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nAll new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine?\nWhile the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift.\n\u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d\nTaking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2.\nI got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine?\nYes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter.\nIn the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d\nHopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity.\n\u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19.\n\u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d\nCan you get COVID from the vaccine?\nNo. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d\nBecause younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body.\nBen-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d\nCan I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time?\nYes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d\nCan I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated?\nYes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death.\nDoes insurance cover the new COVID vaccine?\nThe vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program.\nThe 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients.\n\u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d\nWhere can I get the new COVID vaccine?\nVisit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829.\nDo I still need a COVID vaccination card?\nIf you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones.\nThe CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.\nFor more on COVID-19 and vaccines:\nSubscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.

    "Summarized_Document2": "On the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers. Back in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early. Manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use. In considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants. \u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d Who can get a new COVID vaccine? The CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children: Adults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults. People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses. I recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine? Yes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months. However, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area. I just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one? For people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician. If you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated. Are the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same? Both use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them. Comirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA. Spikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA. All new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. What\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine? While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift. \u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d Taking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2. I got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine? Yes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter. In the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d Hopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity. \u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19. \u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d Can you get COVID from the vaccine? No. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains. \u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d Because younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body. Ben-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d Can I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time? Yes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d Can I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated? Yes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Does insurance cover the new COVID vaccine? The vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program. The 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients. \u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d Where can I get the new COVID vaccine? Visit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829. Do I still need a COVID vaccination card? If you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones. The CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.

As we mentioned, they suffered a loss to start the month, extending their losing streak to five. However, the Lakers went on to win seven of their next nine games to go 8-7. However, as soon as things were looking better, they lost four straight to end the month and end up being below .500 again.\nNothing was too different here than in October. While the team played well offensively, they allowed over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in a 14 game stretch. However, the season is still early and anything is possible.\nDecember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nBecause some games are still to be decided, a couple of games here do not reflect the actual 2024-2025 season. Instead of waiting for December to see the confirmed matchups, we just rocked with what NBA 2K25's MyNBA mode provided for us. The rest of the season does accurately reflect the real 2024-2024 schedule.\nAnyways, it was a better month for the Lakers who finally evened out their record. Additionally, the defense managed to buckle down and play better, though they still need to improve. However, thanks LeBron averaging over 27 points per game, the Lakers' offense is in good hands. We also got to see Bronny James play for the first time, though he only played for two minutes against the Kings near the end of the month.\nJanuary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers started off their New Year with a win to go above .500 for the first time this season. They went on to win two more games to extend their win streak to four games. Furthermore, this month saw the team win some important matchups, including a 1 point victory over the Celtics.\nIn fact, L.A. had three close games this month in which the winning team only won by 1 point. Another thing worth noting is the defensive improvement. This month they only allowed over 100 points in half of their matchups this month. It's not perfect, but the Lakers seemed to find a better rhythm in terms of defense.\nOverall, Davis and LeBron continue to be the superstars of this team. Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

Where does everyone else land?\nShare this story\n\nShare\nAll sharing options for:\nReport card: grading each member of the Celtics through 55 games\n\nThe All-Star break is an ideal time to take a step back, catch our collective breath and analyze what we\u2019ve seen to this point.\nIt\u2019s also a fun time to dish out some grades. The Celtics are 43-12, so naturally most of these grades are going to be favorable, but the minuses and pluses are sure to spark some debate. Here we go:\nJayson Tatum: A\nTatum is the best player on the best team. Forget the Most Valuable Player talk for a second. He probably won\u2019t win it, and that\u2019s OK; he\u2019s the head of the snake and has reached a new level as a leader this year with Marcus Smart gone. \nHe\u2019s taking even more accountability defensively, minimizing poor shooting nights and complaining about calls a little less (I said a little). If he\u2019s not careful, he might become the face of the league in June.\nJayson Tatum is confident he's the NBA's top player   pic.twitter.com/UBL5SyCaZu\nJaylen Brown: B+\nBrown has had some moments of brilliance and some head-scratchers along the way. He\u2019s capable of dropping 30-plus any night, but he\u2019s also capable of dropping 10 or fewer. The most important thing for him (now that he appears to possess a left hand) is consistency. \nHe\u2019s shooting a career-high 49.2 percent from the floor, but just 34.2 percent from 3-point range. His defense and passing have improved, but he\u2019s averaging his fewest rebounds (5.5) since 2018-19. When Brown is elite, the Celtics are essentially unbeatable.\nKristaps Porzingis: A\nIt\u2019s hard to remember a situation since Kevin Garnett where a player adjusted so seamlessly and immediately felt like the missing piece. Porzingis has been insanely efficient on post-ups, excelling in an area the Celtics dramatically needed him to.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively and is more capable of guarding shorter players than I realized. The only small critiques are that he should shoot a smidgen more 2s and a smidgen fewer 3s. I mean, the guy\u2019s 7\u20192 with the touch of an angel.\nMost points per possession on post-ups this season (min. 75 FGA): 1.42 - Kristaps Porzingis 1.17 - Joel Embiid 1.17 - Myles Turner 1.16 - Jayson Tatum1.15 - Jonas Valanciunas 1.14 - Nikola Jokic 1.12 - Anthony Davis 1.11 - Karl-Anthony TownsKP in a league of his own   pic.twitter.com/I58XI7K17E\nJrue Holiday: A-\nHoliday\u2019s 3-point shooting has exceeded expectations (career-high 44 percent), and he sets the tone defensively every night. He always finds clever ways to contribute, whether he takes 20 shots or five. \nHis maturity, consistency and poise set him apart. One area I\u2019d like to see a bit more is playmaking. He\u2019s averaging 4.8 assists \u2013 his lowest since 2011-12 \u2013 and I believe that number could be around 6. Obviously part of it is circumstantial, but I think putting the ball in his hands at the top of the key a bit more could be beneficial.\nDerrick White: A\nDon\u2019t worry, White gets an A. I\u2019m sure my colleagues would blast me if he didn\u2019t, but he truthfully does deserve one. He has career-highs in points (15.6), rebounds (3.9), blocks (1.2) and steals (1) and consistently plays his best in the fourth quarter.\nWhite is the consummate professional and has become a fan favorite. He can do no wrong in Celtics\u2019 fans eyes. Folks appreciate guys who hustle, make winning plays and exude charisma, and White embodies all those characteristics and then some.\nAl Horford: B+\nHorford is always ready, whether the Celtics need him to play 30 minutes or 15. At the moment, he gets a B+, but this grade is less relevant than some others. It\u2019s all about preserving him for the playoffs, and he\u2019s fully capable of upping his grade to an A then \u2013 particularly if Boston plays Philly.\nOne area Horford has really excelled this year is rebounding (6.7 a night). His 3-point shooting has naturally dipped a bit from last year, but it\u2019s still at 40.9 percent. I still want to see him attack the basket a bit more, but it\u2019s possible that\u2019s just not in his wheelhouse at this point.\nPayton Pritchard: A-\nThe Celtics were right to pay Pritchard, and overall, he\u2019s thrived in his expanded role. He\u2019s 15th in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio (4.81) and has excelled as a ball-handler and facilitator. \nHe\u2019s always locked in, whether he plays in the fourth quarter of a close game or garbage time (don\u2019t tell him it\u2019s garbage time). Pritchard fits in perfectly with this core.\nPayton Pritchard stats at the All-Star break:20.7 MPG8.1 PPG3.2 RPG2.8 APG44% FG38% 3FGHow are we feeling about the season so far @paytonpritch3?? pic.twitter.com/BC3DTIIaJo\nSam Hauser: A-\nHauser\u2019s shooting 41.2 percent from 3, which is great, but it\u2019s really his spacing that sets him apart. When Tatum, Brown and Porzingis have the ball, you really can\u2019t double. If you do, they\u2019ll find Hauser open for 3. He\u2019s solid with the bench unit, but he\u2019s even more lethal with the starters.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively, and his mid-range jumper\u2019s improved as well. It\u2019s easy to forget this is just his second season logging regular minutes.\nLuke Kornet: B+\nKornet\u2019s averages of 4.9 points and 4 rebounds aren\u2019t earth-shattering, but they\u2019re pretty solid when you consider that he plays 14.9 minutes per game. He\u2019s sneaky good in the pick-and-roll, an absolute goofball and excellent for team vibes. Rim protection is an area where he could improve.\nOshae Brissett: B\nIf Brissett can get that 3-point percentage up just a tick, from 29.3 to 33.3 or so, that would go a long way. He\u2019s long, athletic and has a good motor, but his shot makes him a bit of a liability at the moment.\nNeemias Queta: B+\nQueta is the definition of a \u201cfun project.\u201d You can sometimes see the lightbulb go off mid-game, which is pretty cool, and he\u2019s only getting better. The next steps are post moves, lateral quickness and defending without fouling.\n\n    More From\n    \n        CelticsBlog\n\n\n\n\n\n          Most Read\n        \n\n\n\nSign up for the\n          \n            newsletter\n          \n          Sign up for the Celtics Blog Daily Roundup newsletter!\n        \nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\nOops.

    "Document2": "Trail Blazers suffer 3rd worst loss in history at Miami Heat\nPatty Mills #88 of the Miami Heat shoots the ball against the Portland Trailblazers during the first half at the Kaseya Center on March 29, 2024 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Lauren Sopourn/Getty Images)Getty Images\nDeandre Ayton and Matisse Thubulle returned to the rotation for the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night and were greeted rather rudely by the Miami Heat.\nThe Heat led 29-19 after the first quarter then went off for 45 points in the second quarter to lead 74-30 at halftime. The Blazers never remotely got back into the game and fell 142-82, the third most lopsided defeat in franchise history.\n\u201cIt was just a rough one,\u201d Blazers coach Chauncey Billups told reporters. \u201cIt was just a rough one for everybody.\u201d\nNot quite everybody. Ayton, who missed four games with elbow tendinitis, did all he could during a dreadful first half by scoring 16 points on 8-of-13 shooting.\n\u201cWe were happy to have him,\u201d Billups said. \u201cDA was his normal efficient self. He was very efficient and he was good on the glass. I\u2019m pretty sure he felt good just kind of getting back out there after being down for a while. I thought he did the best that he could.\u201d\nThe rest of the Blazers shot 10 of 32 (31.3%) from the field in the first half and 1 of 14 from three-point range while committing 10 turnovers.\nFor the game, the Blazers shot 39.8% from the field and 5 on 31 threes (16.1%). The Blazers committed 24 turnovers on the night.\nBillups briefly discussed how the Blazers started off playing clean basketball. They led 11-10 about four minutes into the game.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt happened pretty quick where we couldn\u2019t score. We couldn\u2019t get in the paint. We try to make a point, always, of getting the ball to the paint. Collapsing defenses and then create the chase, is what I call it.\u201d\nInstead, Miami prevented the Blazers from accomplishing their goal.\n\u201cTheir defense, they got physical,\u201d Billups said. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t get to the paint. And we just kind of settled, settled, settled. We turned it over. And we had a lot of what I call \u2018shooting turnovers,\u2019 which are just horrible shots that might as well be a turnover. And everything just kind of went bad at the same time.\u201d\nAyton, who played just over five minutes in the second half, finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 20 points with six assists but also committed seven turnovers.\nDalano Banton, who set a career high with 31 points during Wednesday\u2019s loss at Atlanta, shot just 5 of 19 against the Heat for 12 points.\nThe Heat did whatever they wanted on offense, shooting 59.3% from the field and 21 of 39 on threes (53.8%).\nThe Heat had six players with double-digit scoring, four over 20. Thomas Bryant led the Heat with 26 points off the bench. Terry Rozier scored 22 with six assists.\nWHAT IT MEANS\nThe Blazers (19-55) lost their ninth consecutive game to match their longest losing streak of the season. The Heat (40-33) remained in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, slightly ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (39-35).\nMONUMENTAL LOSS\nThe 60-point defeat is the third-worst in franchise history. Earlier this season, Portland lost 139-77 at Oklahoma City. That 62-point defeat ranks second all-time. The Blazers\u2019 worst loss in franchise history came Feb. 27, 1998, at Indiana by the score of 124-59 (65 points).\nMATISSE THYBULLE\nThe Blazers guard returned to action but didn\u2019t last long. Thybulle played seven minutes before leaving the game with a right ankle impingement. He had missed five games with an ankle injury leading up to Friday night.\nNEXT UP\nThe Blazers play at 4 p.m. Monday at the Orlando Magic.\nLatest Blazers news\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)\nMORE BLAZERS COVERAGE\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "Document1": "Amazon sales come up short, profits nearly double\nby Todd Bishop on August 1, 2024 at 1:21 pmAugust 1, 2024 at 5:30 pm\nIn-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant\u2019s hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.\nAmazon\u2019s sales fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates but profits exceeded expectations in the company\u2019s second quarter results, released Thursday afternoon for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nThe tech giant reported a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue, to $147.98 billion, shy of expectations of $148.56 billion. Profits were $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, nearly double Amazon\u2019s profits in the same quarter a year ago, and surpassing expectations of $1.03 per share.\nSpeaking with reporters on a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said average selling prices (ASP) are declining amid cautious consumer spending. Unit sales growth was strong, he said, and an increase in shipping speeds is prompting growth in purchasing of everyday essentials. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP, and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious with their spending, trading down to lower ASP products. And even on the higher-ticket items \u2026 there\u2019s certainly a drop-off from probably more of a steady-state, thriving economy.\u201d\nAmazon is reportedly planning to launch a new storefront with lower-priced items and slower shipping, directly from Chinese suppliers, to compete with emerging rivals including Temu and Shein. Olsavsky declined to comment directly on those reports in response to a question on the media call.\nIn addition, Olsavsky said Amazon experienced a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange rates, which was about $300 million higher than the company expected.\nIn the realm of artificial intelligence, Amazon is spending significant sums to expand its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment finance leases amounted to $30.5 billion for the first half of the year, and the number is expected to grow in the second half of the year, Olsavsky said.\n\u201cThe majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads,\u201d he said.\nHighlights from the company\u2019s business segments:\nIn its guidance for the current quarter, which began July 1, Amazon said it expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates into a midpoint of $156.25 billion, below the average estimate of $158.24 billion.\nOlsavsky said the current quarter was proving especially challenging to predict, due in part to consumers becoming distracted by news events, elections, and the Olympics, among other factors.\nShares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading. \nGeekWire Newsletters\nSubscribe to GeekWire's free newsletters to catch every headline\nSend Us a Tip\nHave a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 2.8%, and comparable sales in the U.S. decreased 3.2%.\u00a0\n\nNet earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $3.9 billion, or $3.82 per diluted share, in the same period of fiscal 2023.\u00a0\n\"The team executed at a high level in the quarter, and we continued to grow market share,\" said Ted Decker, chair, president and CEO. \"And while the quarter was impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects, we feel great about our store readiness, our product assortment in stores and online, and our associate engagement.\u00a0 Our associates are energized and ready to serve our customers as spring breaks across the country. I would like to thank them for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities.\"\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\nThe company reaffirms its fiscal 2024 guidance, which includes 53 weeks of operating results.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon\u2019s sales fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates but profits exceeded expectations in the company\u2019s second quarter results, released Thursday afternoon for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The tech giant reported a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue, to $147.98 billion, shy of expectations of $148.56 billion. Profits were $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, nearly double Amazon\u2019s profits in the same quarter a year ago, and surpassing expectations of $1.03 per share. Speaking with reporters on a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said average selling prices (ASP) are declining amid cautious consumer spending. Unit sales growth was strong, he said, and an increase in shipping speeds is prompting growth in purchasing of everyday essentials. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP, and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious with their spending, trading down to lower ASP products. And even on the higher-ticket items \u2026 there\u2019s certainly a drop-off from probably more of a steady-state, thriving economy.\u201d Amazon is reportedly planning to launch a new storefront with lower-priced items and slower shipping, directly from Chinese suppliers, to compete with emerging rivals including Temu and Shein. Olsavsky declined to comment directly on those reports in response to a question on the media call. In addition, Olsavsky said Amazon experienced a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange rates, which was about $300 million higher than the company expected. In the realm of artificial intelligence, Amazon is spending significant sums to expand its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment finance leases amounted to $30.5 billion for the first half of the year, and the number is expected to grow in the second half of the year, Olsavsky said. \u201cThe majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads,\u201d he said. Highlights from the company\u2019s business segments: In its guidance for the current quarter, which began July 1, Amazon said it expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates into a midpoint of $156.25 billion, below the average estimate of $158.24 billion. Olsavsky said the current quarter was proving especially challenging to predict, due in part to consumers becoming distracted by news events, elections, and the Olympics, among other factors. Shares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, reported first-quarter fiscal 2024 sales of $36.4 billion, a 2.3% decrease from the same period in fiscal 2023. Comparable sales dropped by 2.8%, with U.S. sales down by 3.2%. Net earnings were $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per diluted share, compared to $3.9 billion, or $3.82 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023. Despite a delayed start to spring and softness in larger discretionary projects, the company maintained market share and reaffirmed its fiscal 2024 guidance, which includes 53 weeks of operating results. The acquisition of SRS Distribution Inc. is not reflected in this guidance as it has not yet closed. The Home Depot operated 2,337 retail stores and employed approximately 465,000 associates as of the end of the first quarter. The company\u2019s stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol HD and is part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 index. Forward-looking statements in the report highlight various risks and uncertainties that could impact future performance. Financial highlights include a gross profit of $12.4 billion, operating income of $5.1 billion, and net earnings of $3.6 billion. The balance sheet shows total assets of $79.2 billion and total liabilities of $77.4 billion. Cash flows from operating activities were $5.5 billion, with net cash used in investing and financing activities amounting to $830 million and $4.1 billion, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period were $4.3 billion.",

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today.

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

    "Summarized_Document2": "Holding too much inventory ties up capital and increases carrying costs, while not enough stock can lead to slow order fulfillment and lost revenue. The reorder point (ROP) is a technique in supply chain management to balance these issues by determining the minimum number of units needed in stock to meet sales orders or production targets. When inventory falls below this point, a new purchase order is triggered. Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times. An effective reorder point helps fulfill orders quickly, protect margins, and keep customers satisfied.",

Small businesses that use FedEx Ground Economy will see surcharges jump to $1.60 in Oct. 30 to Nov. 26 period, as well as through the Dec. 11 to Jan. 14 time frame, an increase from $1.50 in the comparable periods last year. The surcharges will escalate to $2.60 in the more hectic periods of the season, from Nov. 27 to Dec. 10, up from $2.50 in the comparable period last year.\n\n\tThe demand surcharges also apply to packages that are large, oversized or require additional handling via U.S. Ground and U.S. Express.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe \u201cadditional handling\u201d surcharges were increased to $6.95 from $6.55 per package, while oversize charges jumped from $68.75 to $73. Ground unauthorized package charges\u2014fees for packages that are so big that FedEx Ground has the discretion to refuse, return to the shipper or dispose of them\u2014are now $410, up from $385 in the year prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nFedEx is also implementing surcharges that target larger shippers\u2019 volume spikes during the holidays to mitigate strain on its network. Starting Oct. 30, enterprise-level customers shipping more than 20,000 residential and FedEx Ground Economy packages will be subject to the company\u2019s \u201cresidential delivery charge.\u201d\n\n\tThis charge can range from $1.35 to $6.35 per FedEx Ground package, and $2.40 to $7.40 per FedEx Express package. The amount depends on how much more the customer is shipping compared to their weekly average residential and FedEx Ground Economy volume from June 5 to July 2. FedEx calls that increase a shipper\u2019s \u201cpeaking factor.\u201d\n\n\tFedEx will calculate the peaking factor each week from Oct. 9-15 to Dec. 18-24, with a week\u2019s charge being applied three weeks later. This means that a customer that ships 20 percent more volume the week starting Nov. 6 than they did from June 5 to July 2 will see an added $1.35 charge for each applicable FedEx Ground package shipped the week starting Nov. 27.\n\n\tTommy Storch, a transportation procurement expert at Insight Sourcing Group, said FedEx and UPS have both gotten increasingly creative in their residential delivery surcharges as they have expanded their networks.\n\n\t\u201cOutside metro areas, costs get more expensive because the density of delivery is not as prevalent,\u201d Storch previously told Sourcing Journal. \u201cFedEx and UPS are very good at always creating new charges\u2026It\u2019s so complex, and they only make it more complex every single year. It\u2019s really something that if a shipper is not managing on a monthly basis, you can all of a sudden have your costs explode on you.\u201d\n\n\tAs of Jan. 1, 2024, FedEx will raise shipping rates 5.9 percent on average across its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery services. FedEx Ground Economy shipping rates will also increase an undisclosed amount.\n\n\tThe average annual rate increases are one percentage point lower than last year\u2019s general rate increase (GRI) of 6.9 percent. But the higher rates came when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 6.5 percent, well above the July 2023 inflation number of 3.2 percent.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAccording to FedEx, the price adjustments reflect incremental costs associated with the current operating environment, while also accounting for the investments the company has made in service enhancement, fleet maintenance, technology innovations \u201cand other areas to serve customers more effectively and efficiently.\u201d\n\n\tUPS has yet to unveil its 2024 GRI, but it has traditionally hiked rates directly in line with FedEx, which raised its rates 6.9 percent for 2023. Both companies raised GRI 5.9 percent in 2022, and 4.9 percent each year from 2012-2021.\n\n\tThe only reason this year could be different is based on speculation that UPS could decide to pass on the higher costs to customers after 340,000 unionized employees secured a new contract worth \u201c$30 billion in new money\u201d over five years.\n\n\tFedEx Freight shipping rates will increase by an average of 5.9 percent to 6.9 percent dependent on the customer\u2019s transportation rate scale. This change applies to shipments within the U.S. (including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada.\n\n\tDetails of all changes to rates, surcharges, and fees will be available on Sept. 7, the package delivery company says.\n\n\tAlso effective Jan. 1, FedEx will be increasing customs clearance service fees on imports.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Newsletters\n\t\n\t\nReceive Our Daily Newsletter & Special Offers\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Recommends\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAAFA Calls on Biden to Intervene in East Coast Port\u00a0Talks\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChain Reaction: John Singleton of Wen-Parker Logistics on Navigating Post-Pandemic Supply Chain\u00a0Disruptions\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018A Very Difficult Moment\u2019 for Retail: How Could A Change to De Minimis Impact Shippers\u2019\u00a0Costs?\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025\u00a0Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSJ Newsletters\t\t\n\t\n\nGet the news straight to your inbox\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVideos\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs Your Cotton Safe?

    "Document2": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalmart supply chain and logistics chief talks about challenges, lessons learned\nby Kim Souza\u00a0([email\u00a0protected])  December 1, 2021 6:59 pm 7,266 views\u00a0\nTim Cooper, senior vice president of supply chain and grocery and reverse logistics at Walmart, spoke Wednesday (Dec. 1) about lessons learned in the past 20 months since the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the nation.\nHe made his comments at the WalStreet Speaker Series, a virtual event presented by the Greater Bentonville Area Chamber of Commerce.\nCooper said Walmart has learned a lot about the supply chain since the spring of 2020 and now operates differently in reaction to the pandemic. Cooper said Walmart has an end-to-end grocery supply chain that includes an upstream grocery network of 13 import, storage and consolidation centers and a grocery distribution network that has 47 grocery distribution centers (DCs).\nHe said there is inbound freight from suppliers that go into the Walmart distribution centers and then Walmart trucks send that outbound freight to Walmart\u2019s stores and clubs \u2013 and now to customer homes in some cases. Cooper also oversees a reverse network of reusable pallets, recalls and defective products.\nHe said the upstream business consists of consolidation volume from smaller suppliers which is about 80% of the intakes. He said fresh and repack volumes amount to about 14% of the freight and imports are 6% of the volume. Upstream volume has grown from 228 million pallets in 2019 to 235 million in 2020. He said returns and mailbacks are up with more groceries being purchased online in the past two years. Defective and recalled items have decreased 20% from 2019.\nAll the extra freight meant Walmart delivered 104 million more pallets. If all the pallets were lined up end to end they would circle the earth 6.5 times, Cooper said.\nHe said it was daunting to see empty shelves in Walmart stores nationwide in March 2020 and subsequent months. Cooper said Walmart has done a better job this year keeping shelves stocked despite a period of record buying. He said winter storms in Texas rendered 16 DCs closed for several days and that was unprecedented for the center of the country where Walmart has a huge store presence.\n\u201cWe also pulled through 5 tropical storms and hurricanes late last year and one grocery DC in Louisiana is still struggling to get back online,\u201d Cooper said.\nAlso in 2020, Walmart\u2019s supply chain division saw a massive decline in workforce numbers despite hiring events, added incentives and wage increases.\n\u201cFor four straight months last year, we had more exits than hires which equated to net negatives in just about all of our facilities. It was a dire situation for several months, but another round of wage increases and two national hiring events helped the DCs get staffed back up,\u201d Cooper added.\nCooper said Walmart added 2,600 net hires so far in 2021 bringing the grocery supply workforce up to 36,400. He said the employees work in 36.3 million square feet of DC space. Walmart grocery is on track in 2021 to ship 4.99 billion cases, up from 4.39 billion in 2018 and 4.64 billion in 2019. Last year, Walmart shipped 4.87 billion cases which equals the output of an additional DC in two years. Cooper said the retailer only added one DC, an indication that each DC was running more efficiently. The highest week of output in 2020 was 106.8 million cases that occurred in March of that year as the country began to shut down.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that record would ever be broken, but the week before Thanksgiving this year it was topped with 108.5 million cases shipped to stores,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe difference was that in 2020 we were scrambling, running with smaller crews, somewhat exhausted. This year our changes in operations, more automation and better staffing we could have shipped more, except the store operators told us they had nowhere to put more product. This is a great place to be when you run a supply chain,\u201d Cooper said.\nAlso in the busiest week of 2021, Cooper said Walmart made 117,000 discreet truck deliveries to U.S. stores with a 98.7% on-time performance.\u00a0Cooper said Walmart will continue to add automation to its legacy fulfillment and distribution centers. He said micro-fulfillment centers are also a way Walmart is getting consumable inventory closer to the consumers.\nHe said the automation going into DCs and fulfillment operations remove some redundant tasks. He said average warehouse workers would walk an average of 10 miles a day, stooping and bending for 10 hours and lifting a total of roughly 50,000 pounds throughout their shifts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s hard to keep people in these roles. But automating those tasks we can use the employee in more important ways running these machines and adding more efficiency to the operations. An automated facility can do almost double the output of a traditional legacy facility,\u201d Cooper said.\nHe said the path to the consumer is also becoming more complex. Cooper said there is a wider assortment of products than ever before and there are some distinct logistics requirements depending on the item. He said grocery and cold chain foods will most likely continue to be purchased in stores and via online grocery pickup and delivery via last-mile partners.\nBut shelf-stable foods have more possibilities with direct shipping to homes from the fulfillment centers, automated replenishment, store delivery for in-store shoppers, curbside pickups and final-mile deliveries with various partners like DoorDash and Walmart\u2019s Spark drivers. Cooper said the supply chain for grocery continues to evolve as the message from consumers is clear.\n\u201cThey want what they want when they want it and where they want it and it\u2019s up to Walmart to respond to their demands. We have learned so much in the past 18 months and we continue to invest for the future with automation, building a strong workforce and continue to manage the costs of our end-to-end supply chain which is best-in-class,\u201d Cooper said.\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon took part this week with the Biden administration\u2019s meeting on supply chain. McMillon said Walmart is seeing a 51% increase in throughput at the congested San Pedro Bay ports in the past month after shifting to 24/7 shipping. Walmart has moved cargo 26% faster nationally \u201cin terms of getting containers through ports\u201d over the last four weeks, McMillon said.\n\u201cWe have more inventory than we did a year ago and have the inventory that we need to be able to support the business. And we are seeing progress. The port and transit delays are improving,\u201d McMillon said.\nRelated\nRead the Digital Issue\nSubscribe Now\nFollow NWABJ on Facebook\nSearch Talk Business & Politics\n Talk Business & Politics by email\nArkansas headlines delivered to you on demand\nFollow TBP Everywhere\n\n\n\nTalk Business & Politics is a news website that covers business, politics and culture in Arkansas.

The company aims to boost profitability and cut $4 billion in costs by the end of its 2025 financial year. The surcharges, now called 'demand' surcharges, will apply during any period of elevated demand, not just the holiday season. Key surcharge changes include: \n\n- Small businesses using FedEx Ground Economy will see surcharges rise to $1.60 from Oct. 30 to Nov. 26 and Dec. 11 to Jan. 14, up from $1.50 last year. During the peak period from Nov. 27 to Dec. 10, surcharges will increase to $2.60 from $2.50. \n- 'Additional handling' surcharges will increase to $6.95 from $6.55 per package, and oversize charges will rise from $68.75 to $73. \n- Ground unauthorized package charges will jump to $410 from $385. \n\nFedEx is also targeting larger shippers' volume spikes during the holidays with a 'residential delivery charge' ranging from $1.35 to $6.35 per FedEx Ground package and $2.40 to $7.40 per FedEx Express package. This charge depends on the customer's shipping volume compared to their weekly average from June 5 to July 2. \n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2024, FedEx will raise shipping rates by an average of 5.9% across its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Home Delivery services.

    "Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

    "Document2": "How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? [DHL Delivery Time]\nEvery time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver?\nDHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites.\nRead on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it.\nHow Long Does DHL Take to Deliver?\nDHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites.\nDHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily.\nThis logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments.\nDHL Delivery Times\nTo answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines:\nThe process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them.\nUnder this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support.\nWith the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this.\nAs for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them.\nDHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping.\nHow long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days.\nHowever, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month.\nAside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time.

Again, the delivery time depends on several factors.\nDHL Delivery Delays\nDHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others.\nWhen these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023. Even faster delivery speeds in 2024 After reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019. Here\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever: 1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers We\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow. Last year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024. Around the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster. As part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient. 2. Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally Amazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day. We know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT. In December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey. For services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix. 3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies We\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas. We\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location. Many years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Every time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver? DHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites. Read on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it. How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? DHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites. DHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily. This logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments. DHL Delivery Times To answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines: The process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them. Under this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support. With the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this. As for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them. DHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping. How long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days. However, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month. Aside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time. These include the shape, size, and type of the item inside the package. Suffice it to say that these are also the factors affecting delivery cost. DHL Domestic and International Shipping Time For domestic deliveries, shipping typically takes roughly 3 to 8 business days. This applies to standard shipping. As for DHL\u2019s international shipping, the standard shipping takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks. At the same time, its expedited shipping takes 4 to 12 business days. Again, the delivery time depends on several factors. DHL Delivery Delays DHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others. When these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

    "Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024. One thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them. To that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. This is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers. Fastest speeds ever in 2023 We achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service. In the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022. We focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them. And we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023. Even faster delivery speeds in 2024 After reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019. Here\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever: 1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers We\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow. Last year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024. Around the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster. As part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient. 2. Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally Amazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day. We know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT. In December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey. For services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix. 3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies We\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.

    "Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

    "Document2": "How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? [DHL Delivery Time]\nEvery time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver?\nDHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites.\nRead on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it.\nHow Long Does DHL Take to Deliver?\nDHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites.\nDHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily.\nThis logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments.\nDHL Delivery Times\nTo answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines:\nThe process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them.\nUnder this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support.\nWith the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this.\nAs for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them.\nDHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping.\nHow long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days.\nHowever, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month.\nAside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time. These include the shape, size, and type of the item inside the package. Suffice it to say that these are also the factors affecting delivery cost.\nDHL Domestic and International Shipping Time\nFor domestic deliveries, shipping typically takes roughly 3 to 8 business days. This applies to standard shipping.\nAs for DHL\u2019s international shipping, the standard shipping takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks.

Again, the delivery time depends on several factors.\nDHL Delivery Delays\nDHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others.\nWhen these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

In the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022. We focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them. And we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023. Even faster delivery speeds in 2024 After reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019. Here\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever: 1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers We\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow. Last year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024. Around the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster. As part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient. 2. Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally Amazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day. We know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT. In December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey. For services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix. 3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies We\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas. We\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location. Many years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Every time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver? DHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites. Read on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it. How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? DHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites. DHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily. This logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments. DHL Delivery Times To answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines: The process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them. Under this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support. With the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this. As for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them. DHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping. How long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days. However, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month. Aside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time. These include the shape, size, and type of the item inside the package. Suffice it to say that these are also the factors affecting delivery cost. DHL Domestic and International Shipping Time For domestic deliveries, shipping typically takes roughly 3 to 8 business days. This applies to standard shipping. As for DHL\u2019s international shipping, the standard shipping takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks. At the same time, its expedited shipping takes 4 to 12 business days. Again, the delivery time depends on several factors. DHL Delivery Delays DHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others. When these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

    "Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024. One thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them. To that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. This is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers. Fastest speeds ever in 2023 We achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service. In the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022. We focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them. And we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023. Even faster delivery speeds in 2024 After reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019. Here\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever: 1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers We\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow. Last year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024. Around the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster. As part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient. 2. Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally Amazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day. We know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT. In December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey. For services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix. 3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies We\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.

No matter where, no matter when, there is always something that could and likely will impact the group\u2019s supply chain.\nMotter\u2019s predecessors at Group Logistics also dealt with disruptions. Employees at Volkswagen Konzernlogistik, as it is incorporated in Germany, have long worked in close collaboration with plants, brand logistics, procurement and manufacturing teams to keep delivery and production stable. Group Logistics was also already responsible for prioritising and allocating critical inventory, when necessary, where decisions needed to be made across plants and brands.\n\u201cIn logistics, we have become more relevant and able to influence decisions, both in terms of ensuring stability, but also in terms of costs and emissions.\u201d\u2013Simon Motter, Volkswagen Group Logistics\nHowever, scarcity in supply and capacity has intensified the need for this central steering and collaboration. At the worst points of supply shortages, Group Logistics was orchestrating daily supply and production decisions, notably in a taskforce for semiconductors. Motter says that extreme volatility has turned \u201ccrisis management into day-to-day operations\u201d for his team and all logistics functions in the group. They now have a better grip on key supply chain requirements and have adapted processes and tools to support them, even taking direct control of transport capacity where required.\nAnd the results have paid off. Whilst there are still risks in semiconductor supply, the situation is much more stable. For vehicle logistics, which has faced more than 18 months of bottlenecks, delivery performance in Europe has considerably improved, helping the Volkswagen Group to a strong delivery volume at the end of 2023.\n\nDigitalising and designing the supply chain\nSource: Volkswagen\nGroup Logistics is helping to lead on strategic initiatives, including automating and digitalising processes, and influencing supplier, sourcing and manufacturing decisions\nMeanwhile, crises which would have previously caused production stoppages and delivery shortages, including widespread transport-related strikes in Germany and diversions from Red Sea shipping routes, have led to few disruptions thus far. Motter credits these results to better anticipation and finding alternatives earlier in production, supply and transport, as well as better communication with stakeholders. For vehicle logistics, Group Logistics has worked with its partners to secure more capacity directly where needed. In the response to the Red Sea issues, the company has not only diverted ships \u2013 material for Volkswagen factories has even been trucked from China to Europe.\nBut whilst this task-force orientation has brought Group Logistics deeper into the layers of the supply chain, Simon Motter knows that it will be just as important to keep Volkswagen Group\u2019s supply chain resilient over the long term. Motter believes strongly that logistics should be involved at the earliest stages of product and sourcing decisions, and thus help to ensure that changes to the production network avoid unnecessary cost, risk and emissions.\n\u201cIn logistics, we have become more relevant and able to influence decisions, both in terms of ensuring stability, but also in terms of costs and emissions,\u201d he says.\nThat influence has been increasingly evident across strategic priorities, including ramping up battery electric vehicle volumes, meeting sustainability targets and controlling costs. For example, Group Logistics has worked with plants in Zwickau and Braunschweig, Germany and Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic to develop and implement an automated loading system to handle and transport battery modules by rail, which it will expand this year. Experts from Group Logistics have also worked closely with the carmaker\u2019s PowerCo battery cell subsidiary, helping to choose locations and develop the infrastructure and requirements for the gigafactory it is building in Salzgitter and those it has confirmed to launch in Spain and Canada.\n\u201cThat is one of the best things that can happen for us as a logistics organisation \u2013 that we are able to redesign something, and that is exactly what we are doing for electrification and batteries with our production network, our processes and technologies,\u201d says Motter.\n\nSecuring a sustainable future\nSource: MAN\nVolkswagen Group Logistics is working with partners, including group truckmaker MAN and its logistics providers, to implement the first electric trucks into its logistics network in Germany this year\nGroup Logistics is also using lower emission transport and encouraging logistics providers to use greener technology and alternative fuels. This year it will see the first full electric trucks go into operation for Volkswagen\u2019s material logistics in its collecting service network, which for example will see one of its partner in Germany, Duvenbeck, using e-trucks from MAN, also part of the Volkswagen Group.\nAlong with zero emission technology, Motter emphasises \u2018defossilisaiton\u2019 of its logistics operations, including for deep-sea shipping. This year, Group Logistics, which has long-term charters of pure-car-and-truck carriers (PCTCs), will continue to bring into operation in total four new dual fuel LNG ships, which will also have capabilities to use other, lower emission technology and fuels.\nDigitalisation has also been one of Motter\u2019s strategic pillars for gaining supply chain resilience, whether implementing microservices in transport systems, analysing the potential of artificial intelligence applications or leading on enterprise-wide changes. For example, Group Logistics is deeply involved in moving from legacy systems in inbound logistics to a cloud-based, SAP 4/Hana ERP that will eventually cover operations such as transport order management, warehouse, yard and plant logistics. Group Logistics is leading on the project, called \u2018ONE Log\u2019, which includes more than 200 cross-functional employees on the integration across production, plant logistics, IT and finance.\nMotter is also looking at global opportunities to improve logistics performance. In North America, where Volkswagen is adding new products across existing operations in the US and Mexico and new plants both for PowerCo and its new EV truck brand, Scout, he has supported initiatives with local brand entities to deepen existing synergies in the region.\n\nOliver Bronder, head of vehicle logistics at Volkswagen Group Logistics, will be a keynote speaker at Automotive Logistics and Supply Chain Europe, March 19-21 in Bonn, Germany. The conference will feature major OEMs, suppliers and industry experts discussing how to leverage logistics as a competitive advantage. Find out more and register to join.Find out more and register for ALSC Europe\nRecent spikes in logistics costs and risks have emphasised just how important visibility and holistic planning have become for complex supply chains. With uncertainty in the economy and the pace of EV demand, and rising competition among established and newer players in Europe, including from China, carmakers like Volkswagen will have to make considerable savings to remain competitive. Motter admits that will include significant efforts to reduce logistics costs.\nBut he also sees this objective as an opportunity for supply chain leaders to exert greater influence on strategic decision, including where it makes sense to localise supply chains. \u201cIf the individual logistics costs rise, as they have in almost every index across the industry including for Volkswagen, then we have to think about different levers, from the choice of transport carriers to sourcing,\u201d he says.\nGroup Logistics is increasingly involved in identifying those levers. For new products and projects, it now develops what it calls \u2018ideal logistics\u2019 \u2013 an outline of what the most efficient supply chain and infrastructure would look like for an efficient logistics flow. This \u2018ideal\u2019 then becomes a basis to measure and compare with other objectives across procurement, finance and production. \u201cWe then go into discussion. For example, logistics would want to ensure that we have large modules located in a park that is connected to the assembly line with conveyor technology, or to have key suppliers able to deliver from close distances,\u201d Motter says.\nCompromises are always necessary, however the arguments for localisation and other logistics considerations are coming to the fore. \u201cThere are costs and efficiency reasons to consider, but increasingly also sustainability and resiliency reasons \u2013 and on these points our voice is being heard,\u201d Motter says.\nGroup Logistics: seeking synergies, governing standards, building consensus\n Volkswagen Konzernlogistik GmbH, or Group Logistics, is a limited liability company based in Wolfsburg, Germany, wholly owned by Volkswagen Group. With more than 800 employees, it is the central and coordinating organisation of the group\u2019s logistics, but with a special set of functions ranging from the highly operational \u2013 including managing PCTC fleets and a returnable packaging network \u2013 to setting processes and standards across the entire group\u2019s logistics.\n\nSimon Motter, head of Volkswagen Group Logistics\u00a0\nSource: Volkswagen\nSimon Motter took over as managing director of Volkswagen Konzernlogistik (Group Logistics) in January 2021 after working across logistics and plant functions since 1999, mainly with Audi\nSimon Motter has been managing director and head of Group Logistics since January 2021, leading the full scope of the organisation. He previously held a range of logistics roles at Audi, including as head of international logistics, material logistics at Audi\u2019s engine plant in Hungary, and most recently as head of plant logistics for the carmaker\u2019s plant in Ingolstadt, Germany. Motter reports to Christian Vollmer, board member for production at Volkswagen.\nEach brand of the Volkswagen Group is responsible for programme planning and logistics flows across their own plants, with factories usually responsible for plant logistics. Group Logistics, meanwhile, manages international material and vehicle logistics, along with synergies across multiple brands and shared suppliers. In Europe, where the group has the most plants and largest volume, Group Logistics operates material logistics, container management and vehicle logistics as a joint network, including cross-brand network design and forward planning, and the use of logistics digitalisation tools. Group Logistics also manages cross-company steering of critical parts and inventory. During the chip crisis, for example, it allocated chip supply based on company-wide priorities.\nAs a limited company, Group Logistics is responsible for purchasing and contracting for material and vehicle logistics services across Europe, and cross-regional flows. It also directly charters ro-ro ships, especially for Europe-North America trade.\nIt is a scope that continues to evolve. Recently, Group Logistics incorporated used car logistics into its European operations. During recent vehicle logistics capacity shortages, it chartered and commissioned vehicle logistics carriers across the continent as well.\nMotter emphasises the \u2018governance\u2019 role among the most important for Group Logistics, such as setting network structures, standards and best practice, as well as coordinating cross-brand and functional projects. \u201cIt makes absolute sense that our brands and plants have their own logistics, but we want to find synergies, and to do that we need to find cooperation models to define common standards, which is such an important task,\u201d says Motter.\n\u201cIt makes absolute sense that our brands and plants have their own logistics, but we want to find synergies, and to do that we need to find cooperation models to define common standards, which is such an important task.\u201d \u2013Simon\u00a0Motter, Volkswagen Group Logistics\nThis cooperation is often developed in working groups, in which a Group Logistics manager brings together leaders and experts from brand logistics, plants and other functions in a \u2018group management circle\u2019. These groups meet regularly to align on synergies and opportunities, as well as to settle political and technical issues. It\u2019s a consensus-building body, but also one that uses tools and data to advise and take critical decisions where necessary, for example on logistics infrastructure, inventory and network design.\nWhile the group has direct responsible for international transports, it does not usually take operational roles in global regions. Here, however, the governance role is important for developing standards and sharing best practice across entities. However, with the growth of key overseas regions, Group Logistics and its partner entities are aligning more closely.\n\nDeveloping global synergies\nSource: Volkswagen\nWhilst in Europe Group Logistics take direct resonsibilities for many areas of material, vehicle logistics and packaging, globally it has more of a governance role. However, it is increasingly working with regions and local entities to collaborate across the network\nIn China, for example, where Volkswagen Group operates across joint ventures with different Chinese companies, there is no single, countrywide shared logistics network. However, its JVs are exploring common logistics efficiencies, including establishing a returnable container management network closely modelled on the setup and system that Group Logistics runs in Europe, according to Motter.\nIn North America, Motter and Group Logistics are directly supporting regional efforts to find cross-brand and cross-country synergies. Volkswagen Group companies are building new factories, including for the Scout EV truck brand in South Carolina and battery cell maker PowerCo in Canada. Volkswagen Group is also investing across existing factories in the US and Mexico for Volkswagen and Audi, as well as commercial vehicle brands Navistar and Volkswagen Truck & Bus.\nWhilst regional logistics and brand teams remain responsible for logistics in these regions, Group Logistics has done network studies on the region\u2019s material logistics and production networks. At the Automotive Logistics & Supply Chain Mexico conference in November 2023, leaders from regional logistics leaders, together with Group Logistics head of global transport networks Christoph Hartmann, highlighted opportunities including cross-border flows, crossdocking, less-than-truckload and container management. The regional brands are currently planning tenders for some combined logistics services in the region.\n\u201cIt is precisely our job in Group Logistics to exercise global governance on the one hand, and to leverage synergies concretely,\u201d says Motter.\nThe synergy analysis is currently focused on material logistics and containers, but could expand to vehicle logistics within North America, where there are shared responsibilities between Volkswagen Group of America, and different brands in Mexico. But the company has yet to determine the pace of such developments, says Motter.\u00a0\nHe also does not rule out the possibility that the group would eventually incorporate an entity in North America like Group Logistics in Germany, which could bundle certain services together. \u201cThe question arises, of course, but there is no definitive answer yet, as the business model may need to be different,\u201d Motter says. \u201cBut we believe that sharing networks, as we do here in Europe, makes sense in North America.\n\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s important to take the first steps and to get concrete results, and then go forward from there,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nTopics\nVolkswagen Group Logistics series: Simon Motter on securing the supply chain\nHow Group Logistics is overcoming crises and shaping Volkswagen's future supply chain\nReady for any crisis, anywhere in Volkswagen Group\u2019s supply chain\nThe electrifying influence of logistics\nThe many roads, fuels and tech leading to zero emission logistics at Volkswagen Group\nThe quest for one source of truth in Volkswagen Group\u2019s digital supply chain\nRelated articles\n\nVolkswagen Group\u2019s North America vehicle logistics approach saves cost and delivery time\n\n\n2024-06-17T14:04:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nVolkswagen relies on localisation in Europe for EV project\n\n\n2024-06-03T11:11:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nHoerndlein to lead vehicle logistics for Volkswagen Group Logistics; Bronder moves to SAIC JV\n\n\n2024-05-29T15:43:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nOn the right track for rail investment\n\n\n2024-05-03T15:08:00Z\n\n\nBy Marcus Williams\n\n\nDuvenbeck switches to biogas for ZF\n\n\n2024-03-12T10:49:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nDuvenbeck expands into Benelux through Schotpoort Logistics takeover\n\n\n2024-03-04T15:30:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nMore Volkswagen\n\nLogistics in another dimension for SAIC VW in China\n\n\n2022-06-06T21:00:00Z\nBy Marcus Williams and  Christopher Ludwig\n\nSusanne Lehmann, who leads logistics at SAIC Volkswagen, reveals how the JV has managed lockdowns in China and is advancing digitalisation and supply partnerships\n\nVW opens IT centre in Dresden\n\n\n2019-06-26T10:41:00Z\nBy Steve Garnsey\n\nGerman carmaker\u00a0Volkswagen\u00a0(VW)\u00a0has opened a new\u00a0production software development centre (SDC) at\u00a0its\u00a0showcase\u00a0Gl\u00e4serne Manufaktur\u00a0site in Dresden\u2026\n\nVolkswagen Group part 2: Talking \u2018then and now\u2019 with head of group logistics, Thomas Zernechel\n\n\n2017-10-10T13:09:00Z\nBy Christopher Ludwig\n\nThe group\u2019s head of group logistics talks about the major changes seen over the past two decades \u2013 and why he is optimistic about the future of logistics\nAutomotive Logistics is the leading resource for automotive logistics and supply chain professionals globally.\n\nJoin today to access Automotive Logistics\u2019 wealth of global news, insights, intelligence and to make important connections across the automotive industry.\n\n\nJoin today to access Automotive Logistics\u2019 wealth of global news, insights, intelligence and to make important connections across the automotive industry.\n\nYour free registration includes:\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud\n",

    "Summarized_Document2": "Volkswagen Group Logistics, under the leadership of Simon Motter since January 2021, has significantly improved its resilience to supply chain disruptions. The company has faced numerous crises, including semiconductor shortages, shipping schedule misalignments, and supplier impacts due to geopolitical events. Despite these challenges, Volkswagen has managed to stabilize its supply chain through digitalization, investment, and effective partner management. The company operates across 115 plants and collaborates with 8,100 suppliers globally.Key strategies include the digitalization of processes, direct control of transport capacity, and better communication with stakeholders. For instance, during the semiconductor shortage, Volkswagen's Group Logistics orchestrated daily supply and production decisions, which helped stabilize the situation. The company has also implemented automated loading systems for battery modules and is working on electrification and sustainability initiatives, such as introducing electric trucks and dual-fuel LNG ships.Group Logistics plays a crucial role in strategic decisions, influencing costs, emissions, and supply chain stability. The organization is involved in early stages of product and sourcing decisions to avoid unnecessary risks and costs. It also focuses on 'defossilization' of logistics operations and is exploring the use of artificial intelligence and cloud-based systems for better supply chain management.In North America, Volkswagen is expanding its operations with new factories and investments in existing ones. Group Logistics is supporting these efforts by identifying synergies and optimizing logistics networks. The company is also exploring the possibility of establishing a similar logistics entity in North America to bundle services and improve efficiency.Overall, Volkswagen Group Logistics has become more relevant in influencing strategic decisions, ensuring stability, and controlling costs and emissions. The organization continues to evolve, incorporating new technologies and practices to maintain a resilient and efficient supply chain.",

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website. Rent prices listed are averages and may not reflect the cost of specific units. Rental prices can vary depending on factors like size, location, amenities, and availability.\nHow Much Is Rent for a Studio Apartment in San Diego?\nOn average, expect to pay around $2,545 per month for a studio apartment in San Diego.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 1-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nThe average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in San Diego is approximately $3,106 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 2-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nIn San Diego, a 2-bedroom apartment typically rents for around $3,926 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 3-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nA 3-bedroom apartment in San Diego will cost, on average, $4,754 per month.\nTransportation in San Diego\nSan Diego residents have a few popular choices when it comes to getting around the city, and the best option often depends on the trip and personal preferences:\nMTS: The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) operates a network of buses and trolleys that cover a large portion of the city. It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work. The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north. This is a great option for residents who live along the coast or want a scenic ride.\nCar: While public transportation is good, many San Diegans still rely on cars for the ultimate flexibility. Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness. Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website. Rent prices listed are averages and may not reflect the cost of specific units. Rental prices can vary depending on factors like size, location, amenities, and availability.\nHow Much Is Rent for a Studio Apartment in San Diego?\nOn average, expect to pay around $2,545 per month for a studio apartment in San Diego.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 1-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nThe average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in San Diego is approximately $3,106 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 2-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nIn San Diego, a 2-bedroom apartment typically rents for around $3,926 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 3-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nA 3-bedroom apartment in San Diego will cost, on average, $4,754 per month.\nTransportation in San Diego\nSan Diego residents have a few popular choices when it comes to getting around the city, and the best option often depends on the trip and personal preferences:\nMTS: The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) operates a network of buses and trolleys that cover a large portion of the city. It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work. The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north. This is a great option for residents who live along the coast or want a scenic ride.\nCar: While public transportation is good, many San Diegans still rely on cars for the ultimate flexibility. Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness. Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

    "Document1": "\n\nArticles\n\n\nApril 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\nAccording to the Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the small but meaningful affordability gains seen since the start of the year were eclipsed by a renewed rise in mortgage rates, fueled by stronger-than-expected inflation and employment readings in March and April.\u00a0\nWhile the nation\u2019s median list price did not increase compared with last year due to an influx of more affordable and smaller homes, the typical home\u2019s price per square foot continued to grow, and, driven by rising rates, the cost to purchase a home once again outpaced wage growth after just a one-month reprieve in March.\nMeanwhile, sellers continued to list homes at a greater rate than last year. This has led to a promising increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. In response, the time a typical home spends on the market continues to be below pre-pandemic levels\u2014but the gap is shrinking. Sellers are also continuing to adjust to market conditions, with price reductions remaining above the previous year\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nHome listing availability continues to improve in April\nThere were 30.4% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in April compared with the same time in 2023, marking the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.\nFor the first four months of this year, the inventory of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020. However, while inventory this April is much improved compared with the previous three years, it is still down 35.9% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. This is a slight improvement compared with last month\u2019s 37.9% gap, as inventory continues to slowly improve toward normalcy.\n\nIn April, as in the previous two months, the growth in homes particularly priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range outpaced all other price categories, as home inventory in this range grew by 41.0% compared with last year, surpassing even last month\u2019s high 30.5% growth rate. As we show in the next section, this increase is primarily fueled by a greater availability of smaller and more affordable homes in the South.\nThe total number of homes for sale, including homes that were under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared with last year, growing on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row after ending a seven-month streak of annual total listing declines.\u00a0\n\nThe number of homes under contract but not yet sold (pending listings) increased by 6.3%, which is similar to last month\u2019s 6.2% growth rate. After reports of unexpectedly persistent inflation, mortgage rates increased in April on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely push back its first cut to the primary policy rate, which was originally expected in June of this year.\nNext month, we may see the growth in pending listings slow, and as pending home sales are an early indicator of the direction of existing-home sales, it is possible that sales may decelerate further in April and May, after dipping 4.3% in March.\n\nHowever, providing a boost to overall inventory, which has been a drag on sales the past couple of years, sellers turned out in higher numbers this April as newly listed homes were 12.2% above last year\u2019s levels, matching last month\u2019s growth rate. This marked the sixth month of increasing listing activity after a 17-month streak of declines. However, sellers, of whom roughly three-quarters plan to also purchase a home, have been fairly rate-sensitive over this past year.\nIf mortgage rates remain elevated over the next few months, the housing market may see a return to the holding pattern of scarce inventory, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For buyers, that could mean fewer opportunities for finding their ideal home as summer approaches.\u00a0\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends\nThe South leads the way in more affordable inventory growth\nThe South has been largely driving the increase in availability of homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range, and the increase in availability of homes overall. Home listings located in the South made up more than half (56.6%) of available inventory in April 2024, up from 52.0% last year and 47.7% in April 2019.\nIn April, all four regions saw active inventory grow over the previous year. The South saw listings grow by 43.0%, while inventory grew by 27.4% in the West, 17.6% in the Midwest, and only 4.0% in the Northeast.\nThe inventory of homes for sale increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros compared with last year. In seven large metros, inventory was above pre-pandemic levels. Metros that saw the most inventory growth included Tampa (+69.5%), Orlando (+64.2%), and Jacksonville (+59.1%). In large Florida metros, the inventory growth was primarily driven by an increase in the availability of attached homes (condos, townhomes, or row homes).\u00a0\nDespite higher inventory growth compared with last year, most metros still had a lower level of inventory compared with pre-pandemic years. Among the 50 largest metro areas, only seven saw higher levels of inventory in April compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. However, this is up from only four metros last month. The top metros that saw inventory surpass pre-pandemic levels were Austin (+28.9%), San Antonio (+27.4%), and Denver (+15.2%).\nThe South saw newly listed homes increase the most compared with last year\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South, by 19.7%, whereas new inventory grew by 18.4% in the West, 7.5% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.\nIn April, 48 of the 50 largest metros saw new listings increase over the previous year, but only three saw more newly listed homes than the typical April from 2017 to 2019. The metros that saw the largest growth in newly listed homes included Seattle (+46.5%), San Jose (+40.6%), and Austin (+36.1%), while Detroit (-3.8%) and Cincinnati (-1.6%) saw new listings decline. Only Austin (+18.8%), San Antonio (+2.6%), and Jacksonville (+1.6%) saw more new listings enter the market this April compared with typical pre-pandemic levels.\nHomes are spending slightly more time on the market compared with last year\u00a0\nThe typical home spent 47 days on the market this April, which is 1 day more than the same time last year and a week less than the average April from 2017 to 2019. April was the first month since September 2023 to see homes spend more time on the market than the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the gap between time on the market this year and typical pre-pandemic levels, while still present, is shrinking as inventory grows. The gap shrank from 12 days last month to just seven days this month.\n\nRegional and metro area time on the market trends\nThis month, not all regions saw the inventory of homes for sale spend less time on the market than last year. In the South, where the growth in home inventory has been the largest, the typical home spent two days more on the market in April compared with last year. However, in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, homes are still spending two days less on the market than last April.\nWhile all regions were still seeing time on the market below pre-pandemic levels, in the West, homes are spending only one day less on the market compared with the typical April from 2017 to 2019. Time on the market was nine days less than pre-pandemic levels in the South, 11 days less in the Midwest, and 15 days less in the Northeast.\nMeanwhile, time on the market decreased compared with last year in 26 of the 50 largest metro areas this April, down from 41 markets last month. It decreased the most in Kansas City (-15 days), Las Vegas (-11 days), and Raleigh (-10 days). Time on the market increased compared with last year in 21 of the 50 largest metros, including Hartford (+9 days), Denver (+8 days), Pittsburgh, and Phoenix (+5 days each). Ten predominantly Western markets saw homes spend more time on the market than typical 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic timing, including Phoenix (+11 days), Seattle (+8 days), Denver, and Portland (+7 days each).\nThe median list price remained stable compared with last April, but the price per square foot continues to rise\nThe national median list price continued to increase seasonally, to $430,000 in April compared with $424,900 in March, and the median list price remained stable compared with the same time last year, when it was also $430,000.\u00a0\nCompared with last year, sellers are inching back to list more small and affordable homes, particularly in the South, and this change in the mix of available homes has kept the nation\u2019s median list price stable.\nWhile the median list price remained relatively unchanged, on an adjusted per-square-foot basis, the median list price grew by 3.8%, as homes continue to retain their value despite increased inventory compared with last year.\nMeanwhile, higher mortgage rates compared with last April still increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $148 (6.9%) compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $5,900, to $116,000, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.\u00a0\nFor the past several months, growth in the monthly cost to purchase a home was slowing. However, the renewed mortgage rate growth seen in April has once again fueled an increase in the growth rate of the cost to purchase a home (+6.9% year over year). In March, average hourly earnings for private employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grew by 4.1% annually. However, this increase is no longer outpacing the increase in the cost to purchase a home as it did last month.\n\nWhile the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% in April of last year to 15.5% this year, the overall share of inventory is no longer historically high, as the share dipped back below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2017 and 2018 (15.8%, respectively).\nLast month we noted that sellers were adjusting to an increase in more competitive home listings. Indeed, a Realtor.com survey also showed that sellers have more realistic market expectations this year, with fewer potential sellers expecting a bidding war or sale within a week or sale above their asking price compared with last year. Yet while sellers continue to adjust expectations and are cutting prices at a greater rate than last year, when inventory levels were historically low, historical data shows that their behavior in adjusting prices is not unusual for pre-pandemic norms.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends\nIn April, listing prices remained stable on a year-over-year basis in the South (-0.1%), where competitive home inventory has grown the most, but prices continued to increase in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%) compared with the same time last year. On an adjusted per-square-foot basis, prices in all regions grew similarly, by 3.9% to 5.2%, as soft median list price growth in the South was driven by a larger inventory of affordable, smaller homes available for sale.\nThe median list price in Buffalo (+14.0%), Cleveland (+13.4%), and Rochester (+11.4%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. Meanwhile, 21 metros saw their median list price decline compared with last year, up from 18 last month. The metros included Miami (-10.7%), San Francisco (-10.7%), and Kansas City (-8.3%). However, on a price-per-square-foot basis, listing prices in Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City declined only by 6.6%, 2.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, as the mix of listing inventory consisted of smaller homes relative to the previous year.\nNotably, 34 of the 50 largest metro areas required a household income of more than $100,000 to afford the median-priced home at current interest rates, and six even required a household income of more than $200,000. Midwestern metros were commonly among the 16 remaining metro areas that required a household income of less than $100,000. The most affordable by this measure were Pittsburgh ($67,000), Detroit ($69,000), and Cleveland ($71,000). The most expensive metros were predominantly in the West, including San Jose ($361,000), Los Angeles ($298,000), and San Diego ($259,000).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that recent price and interest rate trends are affecting the income required to buy a home differently. In six markets, the median home listing price has fallen enough over the past year to offset rising mortgage rates and the income needed to buy a home has dropped. These markets were Miami (-6.2% required income year over year), San Francisco (-5.5%), Kansas City (-3.6%), Denver (-2.9%), Oklahoma City (-2.2%), and Seattle (-0.6%). In 15 markets, the median list price has declined, but rising mortgage rates have pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. These markets included San Jose (+1.1% required income year over year), Raleigh (+2.7%), and Cincinnati (+2.7%). Yet in the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates have combined to push required incomes higher, and in 14 of the 50 largest metros, the required income grew by double digits compared with last year. The top three metros that saw the required income increase the most were Buffalo (+20.0%), Cleveland (+19.3%), and Pittsburgh (+17.1%).\nThe share of price reductions was up compared with last year in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared with last April, up from 34 in March. Portland saw the greatest increase (+9.7 percentage points), followed by Tampa (+8.8 percentage points) and Jacksonville (+7.3 percentage points).\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics vs. Pre-Pandemic 2017\u201319\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Housing Overview of the 50 Largest Metros\u00a0\n* The required income to purchase a home, assuming an affordability price-to-income ratio of 30%, a 20% down payment, a 30-year term, a 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and local tax and insurance rates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nRealtor.com housing data as of April 2024.

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website. Rent prices listed are averages and may not reflect the cost of specific units.

It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work. The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north. This is a great option for residents who live along the coast or want a scenic ride.\nCar: While public transportation is good, many San Diegans still rely on cars for the ultimate flexibility. Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness. Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

    "Summarized_Document1": "April 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\n\nAccording to Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the affordability gains seen earlier in the year were overshadowed by rising mortgage rates due to stronger-than-expected inflation and employment figures in March and April. The national median list price remained stable compared to last year, but the price per square foot continued to grow. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate than last year, leading to an increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. The time a typical home spends on the market is still below pre-pandemic levels, but the gap is shrinking.\n\nHome listing availability improved in April, with 30.4% more homes actively for sale compared to April 2023. This marked the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth. Inventory in April was at its highest level since 2020 but still down 35.9% compared to 2017-2019 levels. Homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range saw the most significant growth, with inventory in this range increasing by 41.0% compared to last year. The total number of homes for sale, including those under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared to last year.\n\nPending listings increased by 6.3%, similar to last month's 6.2% growth rate. Mortgage rates increased in April, likely delaying the Federal Reserve's first policy rate cut. This may slow the growth in pending listings and existing-home sales in the coming months. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate, with newly listed homes 12.2% above last year's levels, marking the sixth month of increasing listing activity.\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends showed the South leading in affordable inventory growth, with listings growing by 43.0%. The West saw a 27.4% increase, the Midwest 17.6%, and the Northeast 4.0%. Inventory increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros, with Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville seeing the most growth. Despite higher inventory growth, most metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South by 19.7%, followed by the West (18.4%), Midwest (7.5%), and Northeast (2.9%). Seattle, San Jose, and Austin saw the largest growth in newly listed homes. Homes spent slightly more time on the market compared to last year, with the typical home spending 47 days on the market in April, one day more than last year.\n\nThe national median list price remained stable at $430,000, the same as last year. However, the price per square foot grew by 3.8%. Higher mortgage rates increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by $148 (6.9%) compared to last year, raising the required household income to $116,000. The percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% last year to 15.5% this year.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends showed stable listing prices in the South (-0.1%) but increases in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%). Buffalo, Cleveland, and Rochester saw the biggest increases in median list prices, while Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City saw declines. The required household income to afford the median-priced home exceeded $100,000 in 34 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the most expensive metros in the West.\n\nRecent price and interest rate trends affected the income required to buy a home differently across markets. In six markets, the median home listing price fell enough to offset rising mortgage rates, reducing the required income. In 15 markets, rising mortgage rates pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. In the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates combined to push required incomes higher, with 14 metros seeing double-digit increases in required income compared to last year.\n\nThe share of price reductions increased in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in price reductions compared to last April, with Portland, Tampa, and Jacksonville seeing the greatest increases.",

Increased telecommuting and more flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels. At 77%, weekend recovery is higher than the weekday recovery of 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023, as the MTA continues to combat subway fare evasion.\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level. This was slower than the 11% growth observed in 2022. Significant factors contributing to slower growth include rising bus fare evasion and the introduction of a fare-free pilot program on five bus routes starting in September 2023.\nOverview of New York City\u2019s transit system\nWe operate the largest public transportation agency in North America and one of the largest in the world.\nThe subway has a daily ridership of approximately 3.6 million and buses have a daily ridership of 1.4 million, representing 68% and 63%, respectively, of pre-pandemic ridership levels.\nOur system includes:\nHow we calculate ridership\nSubways\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nBuses\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nAverage weekday, Saturday, and Sunday ridership includes every weekday, Saturday, and Sunday in the year, except major holidays and days when the subway system was closed or operated fare-free.\nAverage weekend ridership is the two-day sum of average Saturday plus average Sunday ridership.

DART faces uncertain future as North Texas cities try to cut funding\nCity officials say poor service and a lack of transparency underlie recent votes to cap funding to the agency. \nBy Amber GaudetTransportation and mobility reporter\nTransportation and mobility reporter\n6:00 AM on Aug 9, 2024 CDT\nDallas Area Rapid Transit, the region\u2019s largest mass transit agency ferrying nearly 50 million passengers last year, could lose $6 billion in funding during the next two decades if cities that pay the bulk of its budget get their wish.\nSix of DART\u2019s 13 member cities have passed resolutions since June in support of cutting sales tax contributions to the transit agency by a quarter. Another member city, Dallas, has discussed doing the same.\nSince DART was formed in 1983, participating cities have paid a penny sales tax \u2014 a 1% tax on every dollar spent \u2014 to DART. Sales tax revenue represents about 70% of the transit agency\u2019s overall budget. Other revenue sources include fares, federal funds, interest and debt issuances. Plano and Irving, two of DART\u2019s biggest sources of sales tax revenue, would each save about $30 million annually by cutting contributions by a quarter.\nDART leaders have said that would cripple the agency, leading to deep service cuts throughout the region. Member cities, however, say they\u2019ve waited years to get answers from DART about where their dollars are going \u2014 and are ready to take the fight over funding to the Texas Legislature to change the laws governing regional transit agencies.\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\nOr with: \nBy signing up you agree to our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy Policy\nDART\u2019s system services about 700 square miles in Dallas-Fort Worth, operating 692 buses and one of the longest light rail systems in the country. The urban rail and bus network is the primary source of transportation for thousands of area residents traversing the sprawling metroplex. The usefulness and scope of that system is now in question by cities looking to claw back millions of dollars in contributions, which have grown to $870 million a year.\nHow DART was formed and funded\nIn August 1983, voters in 14 cities in Dallas-Fort Worth cast ballots in favor of forming a regional transportation authority that collected a 1-cent sales tax from member cities. Seven suburban cities voted against the proposal.\nThat support led to the creation of DART. It was the second attempt to form a regional transit authority supported by a 1-cent sales tax.\nAs early as 1988, according to The Dallas Morning News archives, some local officials and residents were expressing doubts about the newly formed DART, complaining of poor system design, excessive costs and mismanaged funds.\nIt\u2019s long been common for transportation agencies to be the subject of poor public opinion, according to Michael Walk, a researcher at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute.\n\u201cThe norm for transit systems, particularly across the U.S., is to struggle with public perception, whether it\u2019s the riders themselves being maybe dissatisfied with the way the routes work or with safety or cleanliness of systems or nonriders seeing public transit as a less desirable service,\u201d Walk said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s an ongoing challenge to correct those perceptions or to mitigate the ramifications of them.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s Transportation Code gives transportation agency boards the authority to voluntarily ask the state comptroller to collect sales taxes at a lower rate than what the public authorized when DART was formed. If the DART Board of Directors does not do that on its own as member cities that have passed resolutions want, officials would be forced to ask the legislature to change the code to create another avenue to cut funding.\nAs cities demand answers, riders fear cuts\nWhen Dallas resident Alexander Dunn heard Plano passed a resolution in June to cut their contributions to DART, he started organizing. On a Saturday afternoon in late July, Dunn and about 50 other DART riders and advocates gathered in a small community room in downtown Dallas to discuss how to respond.\n\u201cPeople are really keyed into the fact that this is an existential fight for the future of DART,\u201d Dunn said.\nDunn\u2019s group, Dallas Area Transit Alliance, says riders will ultimately pay the price for funding reductions. Although he\u2019s a casual user of DART who owns a car, he knows many rely on the system as their sole source of transportation.\nAlthough exactly what cuts would happen would be determined if funding reductions were finalized, they could include less frequent buses, cuts to paratransit service for disabled riders, workforce reductions and deferred maintenance.\n\u201cMany options from my personal perspective exist including consolidation of bus routes, increased schedule intervals for buses, light rail and commuter rail, as well as the reduction up to removal of GoLink service,\u201d DART board member Randall Bryant said in a public statement. Bryant represents Dallas on the board.\nThe alliance launched an online petition objecting to the cuts that has collected more than 1,400 signatures as of Aug. 6.\n\u201cAll of the progress DART\u2019s been making over the past year, more than a year, with regards to security, cleanliness, maintenance, reliability, frequency \u2014 all of that would go away if DART loses a quarter of its sales tax revenue,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAnd even beyond that, we now have to be starting to work from the bottom trying to get back to that [current service levels] before we can even think about improvements.\u201d\nOfficials say they empathize with riders and are advocating to make the system they rely on better.\n\u201cPlano is very pro-transit \u2014 I think that gets lost in some of the discussions and media surrounding the discussion,\u201d said Plano director of government relations Andrew Fortune. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion around, \u2018Oh, my goodness, this is going to harm riders or it\u2019s going to cut services\u2019 and that\u2019s really not the proposal.\u2019\u201d\nRowlett Mayor Blake Margolis said he understands riders\u2019 concerns and does not want to see service in his city reduced.\n\u201cWe support transit,\u201d Margolis said. \u201cWe want to see DART perform well, we want to see trains be clean and safe, and we want to see ridership go up. But we also know that just the way that the business is functioning today is not working in the best interest of DART member cities.\n\u201cAnd if we want to see this transit system grow regionally, then  something of some kind needs to change with this structure.\u201d\n\u2018Rendering the entire system useless\u2019\nLeaders at the mass transit agency say reduced contributions would mean significant cuts to the frequency and number of critical routes. Service frequency could be cut back from 15 minutes to as much as one hour on some routes, and paratransit services for disabled residents would also be cut back to federally mandated minimums, DART CEO Nadine Lee said.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re getting to those levels of service on your best lines, best corridors, you\u2019re really rendering the entire system useless,\u201d Lee said.\nThe agency would also have to halt or delay maintenance and modernization projects. Those include efforts to upgrade original rail signal systems, infrastructure and vehicles and to modernize passenger amenities and facilities.\n\u201cBoth the light rail fleet as well as the bus fleet is ending its useful life or reaching the end of its useful life,\u201d Lee said.\n\u201cWe know that we need to program a tremendous amount of money to modernize our system because it is aging and because it is becoming increasingly more expensive for us to maintain what we have because of the age of our assets. And so the spending that we\u2019re doing is prudent.\u201d\nThe agency hopes to expand services as the region contends with a growing population.\nGrowing contributions means more accountability\nSeveral member cities that have publicly supported capping DART contributions have said they do not want service cuts and the recent resolutions were an attempt to get answers from the agency. Top officials from three member cities said they have been asking DART for years to provide a detailed breakdown of what services the cities get for their dollars, along with local ridership numbers.\n\u201cWe continue to look at how much revenue is increasing year over year, and still can\u2019t get an accounting of what it costs to provide services in Plano, so that really became a driving aspect,\u201d Plano City Manager Mark Israelson said. \u201cI think Plano has been very patient in waiting for some of those answers over these years, and we\u2019re at that point of really wanting to know what that provides to our community.\u201d\nThe agency provided a cost allocation report by city in 2022, DART chief financial officer Jamie Adelman said.\n\u201cThere were three or four attempts that we made to try to allocate the cost by city in order to answer the question that we were hearing from the cities, and I will tell you that every time we turned something in to the cities for their review, they were not happy with it, [but] they were not clear about what they weren\u2019t happy with,\u201d DART CEO Lee said.\nFiguring out how to break down systemwide costs like light rail by city has remained a challenge, according to Lee.\nDART has commissioned a study examining the return on investment for each city by Ernst & Young, results of which are expected in September.\nAlso expected in the fall is the Transit 2.0 report, a study commissioned by the North Central Texas Council of Governments to examine regional transportation needs, including DART funding, through 2050. Lee and North Central Texas Council of Governments Regional Transportation Council director Michael Morris have separately urged cities to wait for the results of the studies before taking action.\n\u201cThe resolutions that the cities are taking are premature and the reason why they\u2019re premature is we\u2019ve already outlined the process to get their questions answered,\u201d Morris said.\nAmong other top issues for member cities is service. Officials from cities voting to cut funding have said they regularly hear complaints from residents about poor system design, crime and unclean buses and trains. Meanwhile, the dollar amount of tax contributions by member cities to DART has grown for the past 10 years and is expected to increase about 4.5% in fiscal year 2025.\n\u201cWhat would have the most impact positively toward their ridership is to enhance their basic services, making sure their trains and busses are clean, making sure that there\u2019s proper fare enforcement, making sure that people feel safe while riding public transportation, which has been a plague on the system and which my constituents tell me is the reason why they don\u2019t feel safe riding the train anymore,\u201d Rowlett\u2019s Margolis said. \u201cThis is about saying, \u2018Hey, wake up, let\u2019s refocus back on the important things that DART needs to focus on and get right.\u2019\u201d\nNot all member cities think DART is doing a bad job. Officials in Garland and Richardson have expressed support for DART in public meetings, though none have taken formal action in support of the agency.\nDART said they have tried to engage with city leaders about how to meet the needs of each community, but often haven\u2019t gotten clear answers on what those needs are. Some member cities haven\u2019t engaged at all, staff said during a committee meeting earlier this month, though the agency keeps trying.\nDART, cities face revenue pressures\nMember cities have pointed to low ridership as a reason to cut funds. DART says ridership has recovered about 83% since the COVID-19 pandemic, ahead of the national average, though they did not specify what metrics they use for the figure. Online ridership data shows fiscal year-to-date ridership through June 2024 is at 41.4 million compared to 52.8 million in June 2019, about 22% lower than during the pre-pandemic measure. DART\u2019s fiscal year runs October through September.\n\u201cWe spend ... this year the projections are $108 million \u2014 that\u2019s more money than we spend on anything,\u201d Irving Mayor and DART board member Rick Stopfer said. \u201cAnd what are our residents getting for it? Are they really getting the service that $100 million deserves?\u201d\nBoard member Patrick Kennedy, who represents Dallas, said cities should be looking to increase density around stations to encourage ridership.\n\u201cLike 80% of where ridership comes from is the built environment and land use patterns,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe should be going pedal to the metal for the next 10 years doing that rather than trying to take away revenue.\u201d\nLike other organizations, transit agencies have been subject to inflationary pressures that have squeezed finances, according to transportation researcher Walk.\n\u201cIn addition to just general inflation and labor costs increases, it\u2019s been a very big challenge to keep the workforce and to then have to pay them what they need in order to stay in a very difficult job,\u201d Walk said. \u201cJust like the rest of the industry, and every person is experiencing, whether it\u2019s parts or fuel, or supplies, professional services, everything has been going up recently, and so transit agencies feel those pressures, just like every other business and company.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say every transit agency is 100% efficient, Walk said. There are significant maintenance and operational costs to running a large transit system that might be difficult to communicate in a direct service-for-dollars way that cities desire. Those cost pressures can get in the way of investing in service upgrades like frequency increases.\nCity leaders from Rowlett, Plano and Irving have complained the DART system is a magnet for crime and the service is losing money because residents with other options are choosing not to ride DART.\nDART crime reports increased 18% for the second quarter of 2024 over the same time last year. DART says that is because of increased efforts to be proactive in addressing issues. The agency has added more than 100 armed security officers to address crime and partnered with Parkland Health for homeless and mental health outreach.\nMargolis has pointed to fare evasion as an area where DART could shore up funds. Fares generally make up a small percentage of overall revenue, and things like day passes and federally mandated discount fares for certain groups complicate the fare picture, Lee said.\nThe agency had 73 fare enforcement officers last year. Increasing enforcement through a wider deployment of officers would result in more costs than returns, according to Lee.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a perception that we\u2019re missing out on a significant amount of fares, and I don\u2019t think that that is accurate,\u201d Lee said.\nDART has said cutting funding would only introduce more issues into the system.\n\u201cThat means now you don\u2019t have money to do the repairs on a 40-year-old system that needs to be done to keep the system up to date, and you keep making the entire system worse and worse,\u201d DART spokesperson Jeamy Molina said in July.\nLooking to Austin for answers\nAny reduction to the 1-cent tax could potentially put DART in default with bondholders, staff told the board during a committee meeting earlier this month. About 25% of what DART spends every year is on debt service.\nMember cities say they are dealing with their own budget constraints. Dallas has discussed whether to divert DART funds to deal with its pension crisis, though only the DART board or the Texas Legislature can trigger changes to DART\u2019s funding structure. Officials have pointed to a 2019 state law that capped local government property tax increases at 3.5% without voter approval.\n\u201cWe had that implemented, and we had to adjust very quickly,\u201d Plano\u2019s Israelson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an extended period to be able to do that. So we\u2019ve learned to live with revenue caps. We think DART can, too.\u201d\nIsraelson said the goal is to lower the city\u2019s sales tax contribution to .75 cents per dollar. A revenue cap could also have incremental growth baked in to account for inflation.\n\u201cRight now, we would challenge the discussion that if they are fully funded at the dollar amount that they have this year and going forward they have a revenue cap that has some sort of increment of growth in it, I would challenge the question, tell us how that\u2019s a service reduction versus the current service level,\u201d Israelson said.\nPlano and Irving send more than $100 million a year to DART. The $30 million or more that would be saved under their funding cut requests could provide relief to city budgets struggling to pay for other services.\nIsraelson said it would be up to Plano voters how those dollars are spent. In Irving, Stopfer said he would keep that money focused on getting residents where they need to go \u2014 though he isn\u2019t sure what that might look like. Bus stops, sidewalks and streets all need attention in Irving\u2019s DART service areas, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of dollars that need to be spent so that the individuals that are using these buses  are in a clean, safe, accessible environment,\u201d Stopfer said.\nWith the DART board not expected to offer a resolution to reduce funding, cities are weighing their options ahead of the next legislative session.\n\u201cIf we really want to deal with these issues, it\u2019s going to require legislation,\u201d Stopfer said.\nA proposal being considered by Plano officials would amend the Texas Transportation Code to restrict the issuance of future debt pledges to 3/4 a cent of tax revenue and \u201cimmediately\u201d institute a revenue cap equivalent to DART\u2019s sales tax projections for fiscal year 2024. An annual 2% growth index from sales tax revenue would be allowed for one-time expenditures, with any growth above 2% dedicated to paying off debt faster.\nThe proposal is a starting place for discussions and is the result of a consensus among member cities that passed resolutions supporting DART revenue caps, according to Plano\u2019s Fortune.\nMost of the items in Plano\u2019s proposal can be accomplished by the DART board without legislative action, which Plano officials still hope for, Fortune said. But if DART doesn\u2019t come to the table, officials will take the fight to Austin.\nPlano will likely finalize its legislative program in October.\nStopfer said he would like to see legislative action to allow cities to join DART for less than a full penny and to allow funds in excess of a capped amount to be returned to member cities.\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s got to be a certain amount of transparency on how the dollars are spent, [and] I think that there\u2019s got to be some correlation between ridership and dollars spent,\u201d Stopfer said. \u201cI think that if you\u2019re truly going to bring other people on board, in addition to lowering the percentage, you\u2019re going to have to change the makeup of the board because no one is going to come on a board that they can\u2019t have a voice on.\u201d\nBoard members are appointed based on a member city\u2019s population, giving Dallas eight representatives on the board. Other cities have at most two each.\nRowlett is also thinking about contingencies, according to Margolis, though he said it was too early to share specifics.\n\u201cConversations are happening more and more between a coalition of member cities \u2014 we\u2019re working on our next steps and formulating that and getting ready,\u201d Margolis said.\nDART is considering its own legislative priorities. The board recently postponed a vote to finalize a legislative agenda that included language opposing \u201clegislation that could detrimentally impact DART\u2019s mission, finances, governance or operations, including changes to DART\u2019s sales tax statute.\u201d\nThe board will revisit the issue in September.\nDART wants to keep talks about how to move transit forward local, Lee said, and continue discussions with member cities about how to meet the unique needs of each area through its area planning process.\n\u201cWe have had conversations with each individual city about their vision for the future,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to accomplish in the future, where they see development patterns happening, where they see their major travel corridors where we can add that travel capacity for them. How we incorporate transit as more of an essential piece of the fabric of their cities.\n\u201cThose are the conversations I want to be having instead of trying to fight something down in Austin.\u201d\nAmber is a staff writer for The Dallas Morning News.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Subway and bus ridership for 2023\n2023 ridership reflects continued growth\nIn 2023, subway ridership increased by 14% annually to 1.15 billion paid rides, reaching the billion-ride milestone six weeks earlier than in 2022. Ridership patterns have shifted since the COVID-19 pandemic, with discretionary travel becoming more popular than commutation travel. Increased telecommuting and flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels, with weekend recovery at 77% and weekday recovery at 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023.\n\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level. This was slower than the 11% growth observed in 2022. Factors contributing to slower growth include rising bus fare evasion and the introduction of a fare-free pilot program on five bus routes starting in September 2023.\n\nOverview of New York City\u2019s transit system\nThe MTA operates the largest public transportation agency in North America and one of the largest in the world. The subway has a daily ridership of approximately 3.6 million, and buses have a daily ridership of 1.4 million, representing 68% and 63%, respectively, of pre-pandemic ridership levels.\n\nSummary of subway ridership\nYear\tAverage weekday\tAverage Saturday\tAverage Sunday\tAverage weekend\tAnnual total\n2018\t5,437,586\t3,046,289\t2,392,658\t5,438,947\t1,680,060,402\n2019\t5,493,875\t3,087,043\t2,407,152\t5,494,195\t1,697,787,002\n2020\t2,040,580\t1,203,072\t932,240\t2,135,312\t639,541,029\n2021\t2,369,655\t1,639,067\t1,249,552\t2,888,620\t759,976,721\n2022\t3,189,904\t2,067,734\t1,635,751\t3,703,485\t1,013,425,465\n2023\t3,625,326\t2,356,521\t1,880,758\t4,237,280\t1,151,998,158\n\nTop 10 busiest subway stations in 2023\nRank\tStation/complex\tLines\tRidership\n1\tTimes Sq-42 St/Port Authority Bus Terminal\tA/C/E/B/D/F/M/N/Q/R/W/S/1/2/3/7\t54,266,441\n2\tGrand Central-42 St\tS/4/5/6/7\t30,517,475\n3\t34 St-Herald Sq\tB/D/F/M/N/Q/R/W\t23,680,977\n4\t14 St-Union Sq\tL/N/Q/R/W/4/5/6\t21,527,757\n5\tFulton St\tA/C/J/Z/2/3/4/5\t17,887,203\n6\t34 St-Penn Station\tA/C/E\t16,974,543\n7\t59 St-Columbus Circle\tA/C/B/D/1\t15,842,348\n8\t34 St-Penn Station\t1/2/3\t15,224,047\n9\tJackson Hts-Roosevelt Av/74 St-Broadway\tE/F/M/R/7\t14,348,691\n10\tFlushing-Main St\t7\t13,876,213\n\nSummary of bus ridership (New York City Transit)\nYear\tAverage weekday\tAverage Saturday\tAverage Sunday\tAverage weekend\tAnnual total\n2018\t1,811,605\t1,122,626\t868,057\t1,990,683\t569,361,220\n2019\t1,770,394\t1,108,809\t847,931\t1,956,740\t557,036,504\n2020\t980,374\t671,835\t532,002\t1,203,837\t316,768,454\n2021\t984,865\t646,302\t482,090\t1,128,392\t311,893,583\n2022\t1,094,415\t662,179\t523,178\t1,185,357\t343,092,963\n2023\t1,082,428\t670,755\t535,911\t1,206,666\t340,766,398\n\nSummary of bus ridership (MTA Bus Company)\nYear\tAverage weekday\tAverage Saturday\tAverage Sunday\tAverage weekend\tAnnual total\n2018\t392,617\t224,751\t170,892\t395,643\t121,448,276\n2019\t388,075\t228,364\t171,762\t400,126\t120,551,580\n2020\t207,042\t132,387\t99,713\t232,100\t65,655,990\n2021\t228,425\t142,112\t102,744\t244,856\t71,431,466\n2022\t268,124\t150,399\t113,157\t263,556\t82,609,386\n2023\t279,247\t159,451\t121,069\t280,520\t86,216,666\n\nTop 10 busiest bus routes by ridership in 2023\nRank\tRoute\tBorough\tRidership\n1\tM15 Local/SBS\tManhattan\t10,468,682\n2\tQ58\tQueens\t7,119,884\n3\tB6\tBrooklyn\t6,049,383\n4\tBx12 Local/SBS\tBronx\t5,900,063\n5\tB82 Local/SBS\tBrooklyn\t5,647,706\n6\tB46 Local/SBS\tBrooklyn\t5,547,520\n7\tB44 Local/SBS\tBrooklyn\t5,468,965\n8\tQ27\tQueens\t5,414,302\n9\tB41\tBrooklyn\t4,759,664\n10\tQ44\tQueens\t4,715,292",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), the largest mass transit agency in North Texas, is facing potential funding cuts that could total $6 billion over the next two decades. Six of DART\u2019s 13 member cities have passed resolutions since June 2024 to reduce their sales tax contributions by a quarter, with Dallas also considering similar measures. This sales tax, a 1% levy on every dollar spent, constitutes about 70% of DART\u2019s budget. Plano and Irving, two major contributors, would each save about $30 million annually with the proposed cuts.DART, which services 700 square miles in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with 692 buses and one of the longest light rail systems in the country, argues that these cuts would severely impact service, including less frequent buses, reduced paratransit services, workforce reductions, and deferred maintenance. The agency's ridership has recovered to about 83% of pre-pandemic levels, with fiscal year-to-date ridership at 41.4 million through June 2024, compared to 52.8 million in June 2019.The funding cuts are driven by member cities' demands for greater transparency and accountability from DART. Cities like Plano and Irving have been asking for detailed breakdowns of services and local ridership numbers for years. DART has attempted to provide cost allocation reports, but cities have found them unsatisfactory. A study by Ernst & Young on the return on investment for each city is expected in September 2024, along with the Transit 2.0 report examining regional transportation needs through 2050.Riders and advocates, like the Dallas Area Transit Alliance, fear that funding reductions will lead to significant service cuts, affecting thousands who rely on DART as their primary mode of transportation. An online petition against the cuts has garnered over 1,400 signatures.City officials argue that the current system is inefficient and plagued by issues such as crime, poor design, and uncleanliness. They believe that reducing contributions will force DART to improve its services. However, DART officials warn that such cuts would only exacerbate existing problems, making it harder to maintain and modernize the aging system.The debate over DART\u2019s funding is expected to continue, with cities potentially taking their case to the Texas Legislature. Proposals include amending the Texas Transportation Code to cap future debt pledges and institute a revenue cap. DART, on the other hand, aims to keep discussions local and work with member cities to address their unique needs.In summary, the implementation of the new light rail line in Dallas in June 2024 has been overshadowed by the broader issue of funding cuts and their potential impact on public transportation usage. While the new line may have contributed to the 83% recovery in ridership, the looming financial challenges and service reductions pose significant risks to the future of DART and its ability to serve the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.",

Increased telecommuting and more flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels. At 77%, weekend recovery is higher than the weekday recovery of 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023, as the MTA continues to combat subway fare evasion.\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level. This was slower than the 11% growth observed in 2022. Significant factors contributing to slower growth include rising bus fare evasion and the introduction of a fare-free pilot program on five bus routes starting in September 2023.\nOverview of New York City\u2019s transit system\nWe operate the largest public transportation agency in North America and one of the largest in the world.\nThe subway has a daily ridership of approximately 3.6 million and buses have a daily ridership of 1.4 million, representing 68% and 63%, respectively, of pre-pandemic ridership levels.\nOur system includes:\nHow we calculate ridership\nSubways\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nBuses\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nAverage weekday, Saturday, and Sunday ridership includes every weekday, Saturday, and Sunday in the year, except major holidays and days when the subway system was closed or operated fare-free.\nAverage weekend ridership is the two-day sum of average Saturday plus average Sunday ridership.

Note that our table lists 424 stations. We combined ridership data for station complexes, where stations are connected by transfer passageways. (We can't accurately allocate ridership to each station in a complex.) For example, the 14 St\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u00a0station is combined with the 8 Av\u00a0\u200b\u00a0station.\nThe station names and lines stopping at each station reflect service at the end of 2023.\nIn our spreadsheet, stations are listed alphabetically by borough, and the rankings are by 2023 ridership. The \u201csystemwide adjustment\u201d accounts for miscellaneous ridership and other adjustments that are not allocated by station.\nIn our tables, stations that were temporarily closed (either fully or partially) are denoted with asterisks; go to the \u201cClosures\u201d tab for the closure dates. For these stations, zero ridership was included in the averages for any days when the station was closed, except for the days when the entire subway was closed or fare-free.\nSummary of bus ridership (New York City Transit)\nYear\nAverage weekday\nAverage Saturday\nAverage Sunday\nAverage weekend\nAnnual total\n2018\n1,811,605\n1,122,626\n868,057\n1,990,683\n569,361,220\n2019\n1,770,394\n1,108,809\n847,931\n1,956,740\n557,036,504\n2020\n980,374\n671,835\n532,002\n1,203,837\n316,768,454\n2021\n984,865\n646,302\n482,090\n1,128,392\n311,893,583\n2022\n1,094,415\n662,179\n523,178\n1,185,357\n343,092,963\n2023\n1,082,428\n670,755\n535,911\n1,206,666\n340,766,398\nSummary of bus ridership (MTA Bus Company)\nYear\nAverage weekday\nAverage Saturday\nAverage Sunday\nAverage weekend\nAnnual total\n2018\n392,617\n224,751\n170,892\n395,643\n121,448,276\n2019\n388,075\n228,364\n171,762\n400,126\n120,551,580\n2020\n207,042\n132,387\n99,713\n232,100\n65,655,990\n2021\n228,425\n142,112\n102,744\n244,856\n71,431,466\n2022\n268,124\n150,399\n113,157\n263,556\n82,609,386\n2023\n279,247\n159,451\n121,069\n280,520\n86,216,666\nTop 10 busiest bus routes by ridership in 2023\nRank\nRoute\nBorough\nRidership\n1\nM15 Local/SBS\nManhattan\n10,468,682\n2\nQ58\nQueens\n7,119,884\n3\nB6\nBrooklyn\n6,049,383\n4\nBx12 Local/SBS\nBronx\n5,900,063\n5\nB82 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,647,706\n6\nB46 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,547,520\n7\nB44 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,468,965\n8\nQ27\nQueens\n5,414,302\n9\nB41\nBrooklyn\n4,759,664\n10\nQ44\nQueens\n4,715,292\nAbout our bus data\nLocal routes begin with one or two letters corresponding to the major borough of operation (B = Brooklyn, Bx = Bronx, M = Manhattan, Q = Queens, S = Staten Island).

    "Document2": "Three ways bikeshare can be more equitable in\u00a0DC\nBicyclingBy Yipeng Su (Urban Institute),\u00a0Robin Wang (Urban Institute) February 15, 2019\u00a021\n CaBi in Petworth by Bekah Richards licensed under Creative Commons.\nThis article was first published by the Urban Institute on February 11, 2019.\nBikesharing has gained popularity in US cities as concerns about health, congestion, and climate change have increased. In 2010, the DC Department of Transportation introduced the first city-operated bikesharing system in North America. Since then, Capital Bikeshare users have generated millions of rides, but use and station placement varies around the city.\nThe DC Department of Transportation clearly considers equity in its bikeshare development plan, and the department used online crowdsourcing to allow residents to vote on new station placement. But is bikesharing reinforcing DC\u2019s existing disparities, or is it effectively acting to reverse them?\nTo answer this question, we need data. Unlike many privately owned, dockless bike or scooter sharing services, Capital Bikeshare makes anonymized ridership data available online. We focused our analysis only on registered members (who account for three-quarters of the total trips in DC, compared with casual nonmember users) because these riders are more likely to be local residents. View our methodology (PDF) here.\nWith funding support from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, we took a closer look at Capital Bikeshare\u2019s potential to address the city\u2019s racial and economic disparities. We placed the 2017 data in the context of DC\u2019s socioeconomic characteristics to identify challenges and opportunities for developing bikeshare equitably. Our analysis revealed two primary challenges.\n1. Station placement isn\u2019t equitable and follows patterns of existing infrastructure.\nDC has 276 Capital Bikeshare stations, distributed in 118 of 179 census tracts (66% of tracts in DC). The density of bikeshare stations varies across neighborhoods. Census tracts with the most stations are generally near popular destinations for tourists and residents, like the National Mall.\nAreas with higher shares of white residents, lower poverty rates, higher income, and higher college attainment tend to have more stations available. On average, tracts in the top quartile in terms of share of white population and income level have more than twice the amount of bike share stations available, compared to tracts in the bottom quartile\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nBikeshare station placement generally follows existing transportation infrastructure, such as Metro and Metrobus stations. About 67% of bikeshare stations are located within half a mile of a Metro station, and 99% of bikeshare stations are within a half mile of a Metrobus stop.\nRiders also seem to appreciate stations that are closer to a Metro station. Bike stations within a half mile of a Metro station (185 stations) generate 82% of trips, on average.\n2. Station use differs by neighborhood.\nA single bikeshare station at Union Station saw an impressive 60,371 member rides in 2017, but another station near Capitol Heights (61st Street and Banks PIace NE) generated only 51 member rides.\nThe most popular centers during noncommute hours are concentrated in neighborhoods that have low unemployment rates, high income levels, more people with a college degree, and fewer people of color. This trend is consistent with findings from a 2016 survey (PDF) that found 80% of bikeshare members are white.\nUse is clustered in high-income neighborhoods\nSource: American Community Survey five-year Estimates 2012-2016 and 2017 Capital Bikeshare Trip History Data.\u00a0Notes:\u00a0Only bike share stations located in DC are kept in our analysis and maps; as a result, bike trips originating from or traveling to locations outside DC are not included. Neighborhood information for census tract 006202 (Potomac Parks and National Mall) is not presented due to very small numbers of residents living in the area. \nSuch racial disparity is also reflected by the east-west divide made by the Anacostia River. We grouped DC stations by east and west of the river and looked at bikeshare stations and use, and the equity gap is huge. Wards 7 and 8 (east of the Anacostia river), which are predominately black, accounted for 10% of DC\u2019s total stations, but they generated only 0.5% of the total trips in 2017. While 37% of the trips generated from east of the Anacostia ended up across the river, only 0.1% of trips generated from west of the river ended up east of the Anacostia.\nUse is clustered in less diverse neighborhoods\nSource: American Community Survey five-year Estimates 2012-2016 and 2017 Capital Bikeshare Trip History Data.\u00a0Notes: Only bike share stations located in DC are kept in our analysis and maps; as a result, bike trips originating from or traveling to locations outside DC are not included. Neighborhood information for census tract 006202 (Potomac Parks and National Mall) is not presented due to very small numbers of residents living in the area. \nThese data suggest that people lack incentive to use bikeshare services in these neighborhoods, even when stations are available. The five stations that members used the least in 2017 are all stations added to Wards 7 and 8 toward the end of the year as part of the mayor\u2019s effort to expand DC\u2019s bike network. But even excluding these stations, four of the five least-used stations are still east of the Anacostia.\nHow can the city use bikeshare service to support its equity goals?\nBikeshare service could improve mobility and connectivity across DC\u2019s racial and socioeconomic boundaries. But our analysis shows that people don\u2019t use bikeshares more just because they are available, raising perhaps the most important question for planners and decisionmakers: what provides incentive for communities to use bikeshares, and what are the barriers diminishing the incentives for certain communities?\nDrawing from best practices and studies on potential barriers for accessing bikeshares, here are some ideas policymakers should consider.\n1. Promote transparent decisionmaking and access to data.\nCapital Bikeshare conducts a user survey every two years that reveals user demographics but doesn\u2019t share individual-level trip data, making it hard to analyze trip patterns by different types of users.\nGPS data, also not included in the survey, could show whether certain neighborhoods are attracting trips by revealing routes and speeds through different neighborhoods. More nuanced data should be collected to boost understanding of how people use bikeshare service.\nClarity in the decisionmaking process for future stations could also be a major step toward involving the community and ensuring equitable growth.\nAllowing people to vote online for future stations is a good start, but it doesn\u2019t ensure equitable development. Communities that need stations and better overall transportation access often also lack internet access and the ability to weigh in on how new infrastructure is built.\nLike New York and Chicago, DC does not specify how stations are selected based on input from locals, so a thorough community engagement plan is crucial for equitable decisionmaking. (Capital Bikeshare is a public-private partnership venture, and DC\u2019s Department of Planning is actively involved in the planning process. View its development plan here.)\n2. Develop infrastructure equitably.\nHistoric disinvestment certainly contributed to the lack of bikeshare use by people of color in low-income neighborhoods. Lack of designated bike lanes in Wards 7 and 8 could also deter people from biking around their neighborhoods.\nIf public infrastructure like roads, bike lanes, bus stops, and train stations are not evenly developed, Capital Bikeshare will likely only reinforce the existing divides of poverty and economic opportunity.\n3. Ease barriers to access for disadvantaged communities.\nUnderbanked communities also face barriers to accessing bikeshare service. Capital Bikeshare does not provide cash payment options at docks, so users must sign up for memberships online or pay with credit card and make a $100 deposit. Lacking a credit card or a smartphone could be a barrier for some DC residents seeking to integrate bikeshare service into their travel.\nCapital Bikeshare already offers financial assistance programs like cash payment options and heavily discounted memberships, but it\u2019s unclear if communities in need are aware of these programs, and data on their success aren\u2019t available.\nPhiladelphia adopted an innovative program to remove these financial barriers that showed promising results. Communities in the city also had bikeshare ambassadors to promote bikeshare use in underserved areas. In Boston, doctors are \u201cprescribing\u201d heavily subsidized bikeshare memberships to people in communities where bikeshare memberships are unaffordable but whose health could benefit the most from greater use.\nDC\u2019s Capital Bikeshare has partnered with more than 30 community groups to offer need-based $5 annual membership. Such programs are promising for serving disadvantaged communities in DC, but better understanding of the demographics of bikeshare users and barriers to to the uptake of reduced-price memberships could help improve outcomes. In an upcoming blog post, we analyze trip destinations and different diversity measures to gather a picture of travel patterns in DC.\nContinue the conversation about urbanism in the Washington region and support GGWash\u2019s news and advocacy when you\u00a0join the GGWash Neighborhood!\nYipeng Su is a research analyst in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Bikesharing has gained popularity in US cities due to concerns about health, congestion, and climate change. In 2010, the DC Department of Transportation introduced the first city-operated bikesharing system in North America, Capital Bikeshare. Despite its success, the distribution and usage of bikeshare stations in Washington D.C. reveal significant disparities. The DC Department of Transportation considers equity in its bikeshare development plan, using online crowdsourcing for station placement. However, data shows that bikeshare station placement and usage are not equitable. Stations are more densely located in areas with higher shares of white residents, lower poverty rates, higher income, and higher college attainment. About 67% of bikeshare stations are within half a mile of a Metro station, and 99% are within a half mile of a Metrobus stop. Stations near Metro stations generate 82% of trips. In 2017, a station at Union Station saw 60,371 member rides, while a station near Capitol Heights generated only 51 rides. The most popular stations are in high-income neighborhoods with low unemployment rates and more college-educated residents. Wards 7 and 8, predominantly black areas east of the Anacostia River, have only 10% of DC\u2019s stations but generated just 0.5% of total trips in 2017. To address these disparities, policymakers should promote transparent decision-making, develop infrastructure equitably, and ease barriers to access for disadvantaged communities. Capital Bikeshare offers financial assistance programs, but awareness and data on their success are limited. Innovative programs in other cities, like Philadelphia and Boston, show promising results in removing financial barriers and promoting bikeshare use in underserved areas. DC\u2019s Capital Bikeshare has partnered with community groups to offer need-based $5 annual memberships, but better understanding of user demographics and barriers is needed to improve outcomes.",

    "Document1": "Reducing Traffic Congestion and Improving Travel Options in Los Angeles\nWhile traffic congestion plagues many cities, Los Angeles stands apart. The Texas Transportation Institute tracks congestion statistics for U.S. metropolitan areas on an annual basis, and Los Angeles routinely ranks first for both total and per-capita congestion delays. Considering the value of wasted time and fuel, TTI estimates the annual cost of traffic congestion in greater Los Angeles at close to $10 billion.\nThe map in Figure 1, based on 2006 Caltrans sensor data, illustrates the weekday pattern of traffic congestion on the LA freeway network. Congestion is pervasive throughout much of the county; most freeways have segments on which traffic averages less than 35 mph at least two hours per day, and many bottlenecks are congested at least four hours per day.\nFigure 1. Traffic Conditions on the LA Freeway Network\nConditions on the surface streets are not much better. The map in Figure 2, based on 2004 volume-to-capacity (V/C) estimates from SCAG, depicts the pattern of afternoon traffic congestion on the county\u2019s largest arterials. Here again it is evident that traffic congestion is broadly dispersed, yet the pattern is particularly intense between downtown Los Angeles and the Westside.\nFigure 2. Traffic Conditions on LA Surface Streets\nWith the recent run-up in fuel prices followed by a severe recession, total travel in Los Angeles has declined over the past two years, and congestion has correspondingly eased. Yet if past trends hold, this reprieve is likely to be fleeting. Should the region\u2019s economy and population grow in the coming decades, as some forecasts predict, the probable outcome is even more vehicle travel and in turn more intense congestion.\nControversial Solutions for a Daunting Problem\nResearchers at the RAND Corporation were asked to recommend strategies capable of reducing LA traffic within five years or less (the short timeframe rules out land-use reforms along with major infrastructure investments). The resulting report, Moving Los Angeles: Short-Term Policy Options for Improving Transportation, offers recommendations at once controversial and likely inescapable. To achieve lasting traffic relief, it will be necessary to manage the demand for travel through pricing reforms (e.g., congestion tolls) that increase the cost of driving and parking in the busiest corridors and areas during peak travel hours. Other measures\u2014better transit service, ridesharing programs, traffic signal synchronization, and the like\u2014can complement pricing, but are not on their own sufficient to stem current and projected future traffic congestion.\nFew Strategies Offer Much Promise\nJust why should this be so? Consider, first, that traffic congestion results from an imbalance between the supply of roads and peak-hour automotive travel. In fact, congestion can be viewed as a solution (though an unpleasant one) to this imbalance; when demand exceeds supply, congestion makes us wait our turn for available road space to balance the equation. Over the past several decades, the gap between supply and demand has widened considerably; population growth, economic expansion, and rising incomes have fueled the demand for more vehicle travel, while road construction has stagnated. We have therefore been relying, more and more, on congestion to resolve this imbalance.\nOne response would be to build or expand more roads to accommodate additional vehicle travel. Setting aside policy concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions and energy security, the prospects for \u201cbuilding our way out of congestion\u201d are limited. To begin with, there simply isn\u2019t much space to build new roads in Los Angeles, particularly in the most densely developed urban areas. As shown in Figure 3, the density of the road network in the greater Los Angeles region, measured in lane miles per square mile, is already far greater than in any other large metropolitan area in the country.\nFigure 3. Road Network Density in Major Metropolitan Areas\nWe also lack the resources to engage in an extensive road building spree. In recent decades, federal and state elected officials have failed to increase fuel taxes enough to offset the effects of inflation and improved fuel economy, thus hobbling the major source of funding for road construction and repairs.\nEven if we could expand the road network, though, the benefits would be limited by a phenomenon described as \u201ctriple convergence.\u201d Congestion has been a problem for years, and many individuals deliberately alter their travel patterns to avoid severe traffic. When an investment in road capacity reduces peak-hour congestion, many will conclude that they no longer need to go out of their way to avoid congestion delays and will thus \u201cconverge\u201d on the improvement from (a) other times, (b) other routes, or (c) other modes of travel. The net effect is that the initial traffic-reduction benefits will usually not last over time. This is why we often see, for instance, that the improved traffic flow resulting from a new freeway lane does not last for more than a couple of years.\nIf supply-side remedies do not create sustainable reductions in traffic, it becomes necessary to examine ways of reducing peak-hour travel demand. Commonly employed options include improved transit service, voluntary ridesharing programs, flexible work hours, and telecommuting. Unfortunately, the congestion-reduction benefits of these strategies are likewise undermined by triple convergence. If a new subway line induces some peak-hour drivers to switch to transit, other drivers will soon converge on more freely flowing roads to take their place. Indeed, the effects of triple convergence explain why traffic congestion has grown steadily worse despite considerable state and local investment in a broad range of congestion-reduction strategies.\nOnly Pricing Strategies Promise Sustainable Reductions in Traffic Congestion\nThis brings us to the rationale for pricing strategies. Among the many possible options for reducing traffic congestion, only pricing resist the effects of triple convergence. By increasing the cost of driving or parking in the busiest areas or corridors during the busiest times of day, pricing measures manage the demand for peak-hour travel, in turn reducing congestion. Once traffic flow improves, the prices remain in place, thus deterring excessive convergence on the newly freed capacity.\nPricing strategies offer two additional benefits. First, pricing generates revenue to support needed transportation investments. And in comparison to sales taxes, a common option for raising local transportation revenue, pricing has been shown to reduce the relative tax burden on lower income groups (though wealthier individuals consume more taxable goods than their less-affluent counterparts, to an even greater extent they (a) drive more, (b) are more likely to travel during peak hours, and (c) are more likely to pay peak-hour tolls rather than alter their travel choices). Second, pricing enables more efficient use of the road capacity that we already have, because roads on which traffic flows smoothly (at roughly 40 mph or higher) can carry far more vehicles per lane per hour than roads snarled in stop-and-go congestion. Paradoxically, then, we see that the introduction of pricing enables roads to accommodate more peak-hour trips. It is therefore useful to think of pricing as a means of managing peak-hour travel demand rather than reducing it.\nPricing Strategies Will Be Particularly Valuable in Los Angeles\nPricing holds promise for most major cities, but the case in Los Angeles is especially compelling. To understand why, it is necessary to consider the interactions between population density and travel behavior, factors that help to explain the severity of LA traffic.\nContrary to its reputation for sprawl, Los Angeles is quite densely populated when viewed at the regional scale. Downtown Los Angeles isn't as dense as, say, Manhattan or central Chicago, but the suburbs surrounding Los Angeles are much denser than the typical suburb, leading to high aggregate density on a regional basis.\nAs population density increases, individuals tend to drive less on a per-capita basis. Trip origins and destinations are closer together, leading to shorter car trips, and in dense neighborhoods people can rely on alternatives such as walking, biking, or transit for a larger share of trips. Yet this can be overwhelmed by the fact that there are also more drivers competing for the same road space within a given area, thus intensifying traffic congestion. The net effect is that greater population density tends to exacerbate congestion\u2014think downtown Manhattan.\nLA traffic congestion is further exacerbated by the fact that Angelinos do not curtail their driving as much as one would expect in response to higher population density. Figure 4 compares per-capita vehicle miles of travel (VMT) and population density for the 14 largest metropolitan regions in the country.\nFigure 4. Population Density vs. Per-Capita VMT for the 14 Largest U.S. Metropolitan Regions\nLooking across the different regions, there is a fairly consistent relationship in which per-capita VMT declines with regional density. Los Angeles, though, bucks this trend. The only other metropolitan regions with higher per-capita VMT (Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Detroit) are all much less dense than Los Angeles. For regions in which the level of density approaches that of Los Angeles (San Francisco, Washington D.C., and New York), per-capita VMT is much lower.\nIn short, we see a confluence of three density-related factors that combine to explain the severity of congestion in Los Angeles: (1) congestion is likely to rise with increased population density; (2) Los Angeles is much denser than its peers at the regional level; and (3) Los Angeles exhibits a surprisingly high level of per-capita VMT relative to its density. The third of these underscores the importance of pricing strategies as a means of managing the demand for automotive travel in Los Angeles.\nIn the end only pricing strategies promise sustainable reductions in traffic congestion. Other measures \u2013 including improvements in alternative transportation modes \u2013 can be beneficial, but none will be nearly as effective as pricing. This recommendation will no doubt stir controversy, but pricing offers the only realistic prospects for managing peak-hour travel demand in the most traffic-choked of American metropolises.\nDr. Paul Sorensen is an operations researcher at the RAND Corporation, wherehe serves as Associate Director of the Transportation, Space, and Technology program.\nDr. Sorensen has published peer-reviewed studies in the areas of geographic information analysis, location optimization modeling, emergency response logistics, and transportation finance policy, and he also holds aU.S. patent on a methodology for forecasting the demand for ambulance services. Dr. Sorensen received a BA in computer science from Dartmouth College, an MA in urban planning from UCLA, and a PhD in geography from UCSB.\nComment viewing options\nCongestion in LA ch III\nMeasuring truck performance vs. truck contribution to congestion (impacts)\nIn current practice, truck performance is most often measured in VMTs and VHTs.\nThe approach focuses on a driver but does not inform about \u201ccosts\u201d or comparative impacts on the region.\nIt does not assess contribution made by PCs and trucks to congestion or consumption of roadway capacity.\nPlanners need to develop measures which would enable them to evaluate these phenomena and evaluate impacts of the vehicle types in a comparable way.\nThe most straightforward solution is to utilize: VMT multiplied by Passenger Car Equivalencies (VMT*PCE), Vehicle Hours Traveled multiplied by PCE (VHT*PCE), and delay multiplied by PCE (delay*PCE).\nA recent study, conducted in Oregon (ODOT), recommends three other useful measures, although, a bit more onerous and limited - they do not allow region-wide comparisons.\nAnother measure that could be used to compare inter-regional conditions is VMT*PCE per lane mile of freeways, highways, or both.\nTruck Logistics\nTruck logistics in LA are \u201cimperfect\u201d/faulty.\nA geographical illustration of these logistics can be found on a map of warehousing, SCAG P&P TAC meeting of 8/11/10, \u201cGoods Movement Update\u201d, page 4.\nThe region cannot afford to build-up on the logistics.\nNew approach needs to be developed.\nFirstly, analysis of truck operations should be broken into three trip categories: (a) local/delivery trips, (b) out-of-region trips, and (c) in-transit/through trips.\nThen, one shall develop brand new logistics for the future and compare them to those currently projected.\nFinally, a realistic evaluation should be made - what can and what cannot be changed of the projected logistics.\nThe evaluation should be based on real and inclusive cost-benefit analysis.\nDifferent objectives can be set for each of truck trip category.\nFor example: for delivery trucks one may want to minimize VMT or, potentially, minimize VMT of goods transported.\nThe current trend of delivering more and more goods by super-heavy duty trucks circling the city and delivering a \u201ccase of beer\u201d per destination should be reversed.\nThe region needs more, smaller warehouses located in close distance to the customer.\nThen, smaller trucks can deliver \u201cretail\u201d orders, minimizing miles traveled.\nSpecific, more focused objectives can be set for the other categories.\nTraffic Congestion Geography\nThe freeway congestion, shown on Figure 1, indicates a radial pattern with a center in Downtown LA.\nSeveral maps that I\u2019ve saved at various hours from PeMS web network and other services including Google, Yahoo, and Sigalert since 2007, confirm the above observation.\nIn addition, one can see frequent, and apparently worsening, adverse conditions on SR-605 between SR-105 and SR-60 and on SR-91 east of SR-710.\nDuring peak periods there is substantial congestion on SR-101 between Downtown LA and west of SR-405.\nAs for surface streets, I respectfully disagree with the conclusion that West LA has the worst conditions (see also \u201cMoving Los Angeles\u201d).\nAs can be seen on Figure 2, and Figure 3.10 in \u201cMoving Los Angeles,\u201d the worst traffic conditions are in and around Downtown LA.\nWhen you compare the traffic congestion patterns, especially those on the freeways, with a map of warehousing, mentioned above, it appears that they are spatially co-related.\nSomebody should conduct a GIS correlation analysis on the phenomenon.\nTraffic Variability and Reliability\nI reason that trucks are, at least partially, responsible for variability of traffic patterns in LA Region, especially during peak periods.\nMost of the other traffic during these periods \u2013 commuter traffic \u2013 has stable patterns.\nOther trip types (than Home-to-Work trips) have certain level of variability.\nThe trip variability issue is worth exploring further/researching, since reliability is critical to improvement of mobility.\ntbc\nAiR-B\nCongestion in LA - ch II\nDemystifying Transit\nTransit \u2013 at the last RTP, a witty professional implied that there is a common public misconception regarding public transit subsidies.\nThe pro suggested conducting a study that would determine real transit subsidies v. real auto trip subsidies.\nThe auto trip costs comprise of everything needed for driving automobile, including the costs of building and maintaining freeways, roads, operation costs of all sorts, congestion costs, health costs, etc. etc.\nThe study could research the costs under current LA conditions (i.e., low density development), but also compare it to other places with more dense development and transit friendly policies such as San Francisco or Toronto, Canada.\nPerhaps these cities can tell us something about LA potential future.\nThis is the challenge to academic community \u2013 who is up to it?\nThe City of LA is trying to accelerate the schedule of future transit improvements.\nCan we help?\nTrucks Taking Over Freeways?\nTrucks \u2013 truck traffic is projected to grow massively.\nThe region needs to consider carefully all potential benefits and costs, including ripple effects of the increase.\nThe last RTP, Goods Movement Report, shows some of the potential impacts.\nTables A8, A10 and A12 imply that future truck traffic will dominate LA freeways, jostling out autos.\nThe autos may be left with little choice but to use surface streets instead of freeways.\nPassenger cars and drivers would incur extra delay, increased driving costs, increased pollution, etc.\nWhat will be the real costs of lost mobility for the residents of the region?\nTbc.\nAiR_B\nCongestion in LA\nVery good article.\nI've read others, apparently related.\nThe congestion caused by truck traffic seems to be under-reported if not underestimated.\nConsidering the facts that a very rapid growth of truck traffic is projected, that the truck fleet changes - more super-heavy vehicles, a closer look into the truck caused congestion seems necessary.\nThe measurements that are commonly used to estimate truck traffic increase - VMT - are not compatible with passenger cars VMT.\nVHT may not fully reflect impact of trucks on congestion.\nI would like to see a change to some statistically proper measurements.\nGood Article\nLA is one of those outlier cities that contradict definitions we use to define places.\nI've heard the term \"dense sprawl\" used to describe LA and I think it's very fitting, and too many people focus on density only in defining sprawl too.\nWhile it has a reasonably high density gradient over the entire metro area, it lacks a true central downtown / job concentration center, has very little mass transit use, and its land uses are oriented heavily towards automobile use.\nI think it's sprawl for every definition of the word, but that's not true in all circumstances.\nI think something can be learned about sprawl, congestion, and metro areas by simply viewing Los Angeles -- as you have -- and comparing it to other metro areas in the US and even abroad.\nGood stuff.\nstill skeptical about those density numbers\nI know you said you are considering regional density, but without seeing how you define the \"region\", that might cause the density numbers to be misleading.\nFor example, if you look at Phoenix, it may be denser than Seattle when considering the giant footprint of all its outlying areas, but ignoring the fact that Seattle is incredibly denser and centralized at its core reduces the usefulness of the numbers you use for this comparison with VMT.\nThe equivalent outlying areas of Seattle might be non-commuting farmland that unfairly bring down its density numbers, as opposed to the sprawling commuting suburbs of Phoenix which give a false impression of relative density.\nI'd be curious to see the same comparison using actual city limits instead of regions.\nRegions defined based on urbanized area within MSAs\nA note of clarification: the regional statistics presented within this article, and in the underlying RAND report, are based on only the \"urbanized area\" within a metropolitan statistical area. As defined by the Census, the urbanized area includes core blocks or block groups with a population density of at least 1000 persons per square mile plus periphery blocks or block groups with a population density of at least 500 persons per square mile. Any blocks or block groups with lower population density are not included in the calculations.\nExcellent point\nThe whole city versus SMSA versus region gets very [statistically] confusing.\nGreat article\nExcellent use of graphics.\nI understand a LOT more about LA traffic than I did before.\nMakes me very happy that I live in Denver.\nDave Barnes\n+1.303.744.9024\nhttp://www.MarketingTactics.com\nAbout Pricing and Impact on Poor...\nThanks for this thought-provoking essay. One of the issues that has confounded earlier attempts at \"volume pricing\" has been the accusation such practices adversely affect the poor and lower middle classes due to lower elasticities of highway travel. This has certainly been cited in discussions about raising the gas tax even higher here in California.\nI see in your piece that, \"pricing has been shown to reduce the relative tax burden on lower income groups.\" If this case can be made more publicly, or, if there can be some sort of trade-off between gas taxes and user fees, this concept could receive greater public support.\nDon't forget about land use patterns\nThanks for the thoughtful article.\nMy only quibble comes with the statement \"contrary to its reputation for sprawl, Los Angeles is quite densely populated when viewed at the regional scale\".\nI've heard this claim made a few times in defense of LA not being \"sprawl\". The problem I have is not with the fact cited, but with the implicit definition of sprawl used.\nIf the word \"sprawl\" is to have any use as a concept, then it cannot be simply a proxy for density.\nFigure 4 demonstrates this - there is clearly something going on in LA that is not captured by density but nonetheless causes it to merit the label of sprawl.\nI would argue that this \"something\" is the pattern of land use.\nIt doesn't matter if you live in a residential neighborhood with 30 units to the acre, if the only thing that's around you for 1/2 a mile is other homes, then you're still probably going to drive to your destination.\nAuto dependence and land use segregation feed back on each other too, since residential areas will be unwilling to accept commercial establishments if they bring excessive traffic in with them.\nThe result is the worst of both worlds, where residents get all the downsides of density with few of the benefits.\nA truly comprehensive solution to congestion requires addressing both transportation policies and land use policies.\nSubscribe to NG Articles\nCONNECT WITH US:\nNewGeography.com is a joint venture of Joel Kotkin and Praxis Strategy Group\nFeatured Content\nThe Coming of Neo-Feudalism\nJoel Kotkin's newest book The Coming of Neo-Feudalism: A Warning to the Global Middle Class is now available to order.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Reducing Traffic Congestion and Improving Travel Options in Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles is notorious for its severe traffic congestion, consistently ranking first in the U.S. for both total and per-capita congestion delays. The Texas Transportation Institute estimates the annual cost of traffic congestion in greater Los Angeles at nearly $10 billion. Congestion is widespread, affecting both freeways and surface streets, particularly between downtown Los Angeles and the Westside.\n\nRecent economic downturns and rising fuel prices have temporarily eased congestion, but this is expected to be short-lived. As the region's economy and population grow, so will vehicle travel and congestion.\n\nRAND Corporation researchers recommend short-term strategies to reduce LA traffic, focusing on pricing reforms like congestion tolls to manage travel demand. Other measures, such as better transit service and ridesharing programs, can complement pricing but are insufficient on their own.\n\nTraffic congestion results from an imbalance between road supply and peak-hour travel demand. Building more roads is not a viable solution due to space constraints, limited resources, and the phenomenon of 'triple convergence,' where initial traffic reduction benefits are short-lived as drivers adjust their travel patterns.\n\nReducing peak-hour travel demand through improved transit, ridesharing, flexible work hours, and telecommuting is also undermined by triple convergence. Only pricing strategies, which increase the cost of driving or parking during peak hours, promise sustainable reductions in traffic congestion. Pricing not only manages demand but also generates revenue for transportation investments and enables more efficient use of existing road capacity.\n\nLos Angeles, with its high regional population density and high per-capita vehicle miles traveled (VMT), is particularly suited for pricing strategies. Despite its reputation for sprawl, LA's regional density exacerbates congestion, making pricing an effective tool for managing travel demand.\n\nIn conclusion, pricing strategies offer the most realistic prospects for managing peak-hour travel demand in Los Angeles. Other measures can be beneficial but are not as effective as pricing in achieving sustainable traffic congestion reductions.",
