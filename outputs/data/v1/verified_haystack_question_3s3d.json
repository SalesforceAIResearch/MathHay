(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

    "Document2": "Alibaba Group\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue grew 7% year-over-year to RMB221.87 billion ($30.73 billion), edging ahead of forecasts as it notched wins across its core e-commerce and cloud businesses.\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31 outpaced Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimate of approximately RMB219.80 billion, while revenue for the 2024 fiscal year rose 8% year-over-year to RMB941.17 billion.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen early results from increased investment in our strategic business priorities and are confident in our business outlook,\u201d said Toby Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group.\nAlibaba\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) for the quarter decreased 5% year-over-year to RMB23.97 billion, primarily due to increased investment in its e-commerce businesses and one-time retention incentives for employees of logistics arm Cainiao. Quarterly non-GAAP net income declined 11% year-over-year to RMB24.42 billion.\nAlibaba increased its capital expenditure on Alibaba Cloud infrastructure and its Chinese and cross-border e-commerce businesses, leading to double-digit growth across key metrics including gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that our strategies are working and we are returning to growth,\u201d said Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.\nThe company also announced a $4.0 billion dividend distribution to continuously enhance shareholder return.\nAlibaba\u2019s e-commerce businesses recorded an uptick in purchasing frequency and customer retention over the quarter, even as retail growth slowed in China.\nAcross the country, total retail sales of consumer goods in March grew 3.1% year-over-year, trailing the 5.5% and 7.4% growth recorded in the January-February and December periods, respectively, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.\nDespite the broader slowdown, revenue during the latest quarter grew 4% year-on-year to RMB93.22 billion at Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG).\nTTG\u2019s adjusted EBITA shrank slightly to RMB38.5 billion compared to RMB39.04 billion in the same quarter of 2023, as the business increased strategic investment in areas including customer service, membership program benefits and technology.\n\u201cOur China and international commerce businesses realized double-digit year-over-year GMV growth through our focus on the customer experience,\u201d said Wu, who stepped into the role of Taobao and Tmall Group CEO last year.\nHe has emphasized that 2024 would be a year of strategic upgrades and significant investment into the core businesses, and it has started to bear fruit.\nOnline gross merchandise value \u2013 excluding unpaid orders \u2013 and order growth expanded by double-digits year-over-year, fueling a 5% increase in customer management revenue.\nMembership in TTG\u2019s 88VIP loyalty program increased by double digits year-over-year in the quarter to top 35 million members, as consumers were enticed by improving service and more benefits.\nTaobao has introduced more user-friendly measures including a simplified 6.18 sales structure and a website update. Likewise, Tmall announced plans to triple the scale of resources dedicated to new products.\nBetween January and March, the number of new merchants on Tmall rose 60% year-over-year, while the total transaction volume of new merchants over this time increased by 150% compared with last year.\nQuarterly revenue from the company\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group rose 3% to RMB25.60 billion, driven by the double-digit growth of its public cloud business.\nAlibaba Cloud\u2019s public cloud offerings are available online for organizations and individuals alike, and include elastic compute, database and AI products and services. The company saw triple-digit growth in AI-related revenue in the fourth quarter.\nTo attract start-ups and small businesses that will support long-term growth, Alibaba recently slashed the price of over 100 core public cloud products in the Chinese market.\nIn April, the company also extended these cost reductions to international customers, with an average price reduction of 23%.\n\u201cWe are excited by the accelerated growth of customers and cloud computing revenues related to our AI products. We will remain focused on our strategic priorities and capture future growth opportunities,\u201d said Wu.\nOver 90,000 enterprises have adopted Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen large language model (LLM) since it debuted a year ago, on top of more than 7 million downloads on open-source platforms like Github.\nAlibaba Cloud recently launched a service to help companies customize and scale generative AI models, from consolidating multiple models to optimizing underlying infrastructure resources.\nIn addition, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI-driven sustainability platform Energy Expert rolled out an open API service enabling developers to build customized sustainability applications.\nIts AI computing platform for high-performance computing tasks, PAI-Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service, became available in Singapore for the first time this year.\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) marketplaces notched a 20% increase in combined orders for the latest quarter as revenue grew 45% year-over-year to RMB27.45 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nCross-border retail platform AliExpress provides price-competitive products and efficient fulfillment under its Choice service, which accounted for around 70% of AliExpress\u2019s total orders in April 2024.\nIncreased synergies between AliExpress and Cainiao led five to ten-day delivery completion rates to double year-over-year for Choice orders over the quarter.\nCainiao, which withdrew its plan to make an initial public offering on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange in March partly to focus on supporting cross-border fulfillment services within AIDC, has also gone from strength to strength.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue from Cainiao grew 30% year-over-year to RMB24.56 billion. Cainiao\u2019s five to ten-day delivery service extended into four additional countries during the quarter, bringing the number of countries covered by the premium service to 14.\nInvestment in cross-border initiatives ramped up across the board in the fourth quarter.\nTurkish online retailer Trendyol expanded into the Gulf region and has become one of the region\u2019s most downloaded e-commerce apps. At the same time, AliExpress earmarked millions of euros for discounts and deals as part of an exclusive global sponsorship of the upcoming UEFA European Football Championship set for this summer.\nAs a result of increased investment in key markets to enhance customer experience and expand consumer base, AIDC posted a loss of RMB4.09 billion in the quarter for adjusted EBITA.\nAs part of management\u2019s commitment to delivering value to shareholders, Alibaba has announced a two-part dividend worth an aggregate $4.0 billion.\nThe Alibaba board approved an annual regular cash dividend for the most recent fiscal year and an extraordinary cash dividend comprised of proceeds from the disposition of certain financial investments.\nThe one-time extraordinary dividend will come to $0.0825 per ordinary share or $0.66 per ADS and will be paid in U.S. dollars to holders of ordinary shares and ADSs as of the close of business on June 13, 2024, Hong Kong Time and New York Time, respectively.\n\u201cWe are committed to continuing to return value to our shareholders,\u201d said Alibaba\u2019s Xu.\nEarlier this year, the group said it would begin voluntary updates on its share repurchase program to increase transparency for investors.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Alibaba repurchased 1.25 billion ordinary shares for a total of $12.5 billion, including 524 million ordinary shares repurchased in its fourth fiscal quarter.\nAlibaba\u2019s total shareholder yield, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, led its large-cap peers by reaching 6.5% during the 2023 calendar year.\nThe holding company, which made its 2014 stock market debut in New York and completed a secondary listing in Hong Kong in 2019, is also in the midst of preparations for a dual-primary listing on the two bourses slated for the end of August 2024.",

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results\n\nConsolidated results came in at the high end or ahead of guidance for key performance metrics\nBROOKLYN, N.Y., July 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, today announced results for its second quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024.\n\"We are pleased that second quarter consolidated results included sequential acceleration of Etsy marketplace year-over-year GMS, higher consolidated revenue both year-over-year and sequentially, and strong adjusted EBITDA profitability,\" said Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. Chief Executive Officer. \"Gifting is proving to be a winning theme - driving growth as a key source of differentiation for Etsy. We are making excellent progress with other bold moves and investments meant to raise consideration among buyers - to help us stand apart more than ever. While this is a challenging environment for our type of goods, we are focused on reigniting Etsy marketplace growth and gaining market share.\"\nSecond quarter 2024 performance highlights include:\n\"We are investing in strategic growth areas including Gifting, highlighting the best of Etsy through Quality initiatives, launching a new Loyalty Program, expanding our App, and more, while also carefully managing expenses to deliver very healthy profit,\" said Rachel Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. \"In fact, second quarter adjusted EBITDA was about 28%, ahead of our guidance and up 130 bps from last year, as we gained leverage year-over-year on employee costs and cost of revenue, which was partially offset by higher level of performance marketing investments to help fuel buyer growth and frequency. The Etsy marketplace's record level of active buyers has held up quite well, and we added approximately 12 million new and reactivated buyers during the quarter.\"\n______________________________________\n1\u00a0Etsy Gifting GMS: Estimate based upon word 'gift' in the listing title, shipped with a gift message, or other signal the item was purchased as a gift.\n2\u00a0Source: Consumer Edge spend data from sampling of credit card transactions from online 'gifting' peers Zola, Zazzle, Minted, Uncommon Goods, Hallmark, and Mark and Graham.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Summary(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThe financial results of Elo7 have been included in our consolidated financial results for the prior year periods, as Elo7 was sold on August 10, 2023.

In 2024, we are focused on building buyer consideration by making it easier to 'find the best stuff' on Etsy, driving association that Etsy sellers offer great value, and making shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable. The below highlights some of our key initiatives:\nProduct Highlights:\nIn order to drive\u00a0buyer Consideration, we are making progress in our efforts to position Etsy as an indispensable partner for Gifting, with broad based investments positively impacting our performance:\nWe launched a \"Made for You\" microsite to increase consideration and help buyers get the most out of shopping on Etsy. It features our latest product improvements, including Gift Mode, the Deals Tab, the Etsy's Picks badge, and Etsy Purchase Protection.\u00a0The microsite was launched globally in June, is available in 11 languages, and has already attracted hundreds of thousands of users.\nTo help buyers 'find the best stuff on Etsy,' we invested in the following Quality initiatives:\nAligned with our efforts to make shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable, and also to drive international growth, we recently secured a new preferred shipping partnership with a third party to simplify cross-border logistics for Turkish sellers. We continued to expand Etsy Payments globally, with about 98% of our GMS now processed through our platform.\nWe worked to continue to build trust in our marketplace with a roll out of our new seller set-up fee in additional regions. This fee, meant to strengthen our new shop onboarding process, and in combination with added trust and safety enforcement - resulted in a significant decline in fraudulent onboarding, while continuing to provide ample access for creative entrepreneurs to start businesses on Etsy.\nMarketing Highlights:\nWe further developed plans to launch our new Etsy Insider Loyalty program, currently scheduled to be introduced in invitation-only beta form to targeted occasional Etsy U.S. buyers in mid-September. Etsy Insider will be buyer-fee based, offering free U.S. domestic shipping on millions of items, item discounts, first access merchandise and other benefits, with a goal to drive frequency and loyalty over time.\nWe now manage all of Etsy's paid search campaigns in-house, enabling us to reallocate the significant external costs of managing these campaigns directly into the campaigns themselves.\nTo support our U.S. sellers, we launched a targeted marketing campaign to promote the availability of a seller financing program offered via a third party partner. We've observed strong initial engagement from the campaign signaling interest and need for additional capital among our seller community.\nEtsy's Creator Collective program, which incentivizes creators and influencers to drive purchases, social conversation, and unique content for Etsy by providing affiliate links to any page on Etsy.com and boosting top posts, has reached over 260,000 participants.\nReverb\nDepop\nConsolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance\u00a0\nQ3 24 Guidance\nGMS \nWe currently estimate that Consolidated GMS will decline in the low single digit range on a year-over-year basis. \nTake Rate\nSimilar to Q2 24\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n~27%\nRegarding our full-year 2024 outlook, we reiterate that consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin should come in at least the same as the 2023 result.\nPlease note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.\nWith respect to our expectations under \"Consolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance \" and outlook for the remainder of 2024 above, reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; in particular, stock-based compensation expense, foreign exchange (gain) loss, interest and other non-operating income, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses, and other non-recurring expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\u00a0\nEtsy will host a video webcast conference call to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will be live-streamed via our Investor Relations website (investors.etsy.com) under the Events section. A copy of the earnings call presentation will also be posted to our website.\nA replay of the video webcast will be available through the same link following the conference call starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, for at least three months thereafter.\nAbout Etsy\nEtsy, Inc. operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world.

asset impairment charges;\u00a0restructuring and other exit (income) costs; and retroactive non-income tax expense. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure that presents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation, and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platforms.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income, revenue, and our other GAAP results.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and the Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 53,005\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 61,915\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 116,009\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 136,452\nExcluding:\nInterest and other non-operating income, net \n(3,947)\n(5,934)\n(9,257)\n(11,623)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n25,972\n(56,501)\n42,623\n(49,767)\nDepreciation and amortization\n27,087\n22,946\n53,933\n46,118\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n74,717\n77,281\n145,400\n145,964\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n(4,861)\n(1,852)\n(11,116)\n765\nAcquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses \n234\n289\n2,132\n578\nAsset impairment charges\n\u2014\n68,091\n\u2014\n68,091\nRestructuring and other exit (income) costs \n(76)\n\u2014\n342\n\u2014\nRetroactive non-income tax expense\u00a0 (2)\n7,244\n\u2014\n7,244\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 179,375\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 166,235\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 347,310\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 336,578\nDivided by:\nRevenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 647,806\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 628,876\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,293,760\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,269,753\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n27.7\u00a0%\n26.4\u00a0%\n26.8\u00a0%\n26.5\u00a0%\n(1)\nStock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented below is as follows:\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCost of revenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,787\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,171\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,491\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15,417\nMarketing\n5,882\n6,107\n12,319\n11,369\nProduct development\n38,441\n38,220\n72,505\n74,929\nGeneral and administrative\n21,607\n24,783\n44,085\n44,249\nStock-based compensation expense \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74,717\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 77,281\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,400\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,964\n(2)\nRetroactive non-income tax expense related to the digital services tax legislation in Canada, which was enacted on June 28, 2024 retroactive to January 1, 2022.\n\u00a0\n View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/etsy-inc-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211378.html\nSOURCE  Etsy, Inc.\n\nEmail Alerts\n\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life.

The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

We then ranked each school according to the top variables college students selected in our College Choice and Admissions Survey. To learn more, check out our full rankings methodology or read the summary below.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRanking Methodology Summary\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo qualify for our rankings lists, each school must be an accredited public or private, nonprofit institution. Each eligible school was then ranked based on a formula measuring:\n\n\nIn addition, we only included colleges with graduation rates in the top third of all online colleges.\nFlorida College Tuition\nCollege tuition runs far cheaper in Florida than the national average. Undergraduates attending public four-year colleges in Florida in 2022-2023 paid $4,540 for tuition and fees, about $5,000 less than the national average.\nPrivate college students in Florida also pay less, spending an average of $30,928 in tuition and fees, while the national average for private college tuition was $35,248 in 2022-2023.\nFlorida online colleges may offer a more affordable education since you don't need to pay for transportation and on-campus housing fees, though online learners sometimes need to pay technology fees not charged to on-campus students.\nIn addition, online tuition often costs less than studying on campus. For instance, in-state undergrads at the University of Florida pay $6,380 per year, while in-state undergrads at UF Online pay $3,876 per year. In this case, attending the University of Florida Online will save you nearly 50% in tuition.\nWhy Study Online in Florida?\nOnline learning offers many benefits beyond convenience, affordability, and flexibility.

    "Summarized_Document1": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

series whenever new monthly data are added; the inclusion of the most recent LFS data in the calculation process; update of seasonal adjustment models with complete annual data.\nCompared with the rates published in News Release of 3 April 2024, the February 2024 unemployment rate for the EU has been revised from 6.0% to 6.1%, while the unemployment rate for the euro area remained unchanged. Among EU Member States, the rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) upwards for Spain (by 0.3 pp) as well as for Finland and Sweden (by 0.2 pp each). The rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) downwards for Greece (by 0.2 pp).\nCountry notes\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden as well as Iceland and Norway: the trend component is used instead of the more volatile seasonally adjusted data.\nEstonia and Portugal: 3-month moving averages of LFS data are used instead of pure monthly indicators.\nMethods and definitions\nEurostat publishes harmonised unemployment rates for individual EU Member States, the euro area and the EU. These unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The measurement is based on a harmonised data source, the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS).\nBased on the ILO definition, Eurostat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:\nare without work;\nare available to start work within the next two weeks;\nand have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks.\nThe unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.\nThe labour force is the total number of people employed plus unemployed. In this news release unemployment rates are based on employment and unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74.\nThe youth unemployment rate is the number of people aged 15 to 24 unemployed as a percentage of the labour force of the same age. Therefore, the youth unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the share of jobless people in the overall youth population.\nWhen data for the most recent month are not available for a Member State, EU and EA aggregates are calculated using the latest data available for that Member State.\nGeographical information\nEuro area (EA20): Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.\nEuropean Union (EU27): Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden.\nFor more information\nEurostat website section on employment and unemployment\nEurostat database section on unemployment, including non-seasonally adjusted and trend data\nStatistics Explained articles on unemployment\nEurostat metadata on adjusted unemployment series\nEuro indicators dashboard\nRelease calendar for Euro indicators\nEuropean Statistics Code of Practice\nGet in touch\nMedia requests\n\n\n\n\nEurostat Media Support\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 33 408\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: eurostat-mediasupport@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nFurther information on data\n\n\n\n\nThibaut HENRION\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 31 686\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevena CHOLAKOVA\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 35 304\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: estat-monthly-unemployment@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nShare the release\n\nWas this page useful?                \nIf you do not wish to provide more detailed feedback, please just click on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button to send your response. \n\nNeed help?                    \n\nFollow us                    \n\nContact the EU                    \n\nSocial media                    \n\nLegal                    \n\nEU institutions                    \n\n                        EU institutions\n                    \n",

All rights reserved. Key takeaways \u2022 China\u2019s GDP grew 5% year-over-year (YoY) in H1 2024, reaching the target set at the Two Sessions earlier this year. In Q2 2024, the economy grew 4.7%, down from 5.3% in Q1 and lower than market expectations. Extreme weather, adjustments to calculations of the value of the financial industry, and sluggish domestic demand weighed on economic growth. \u2022 The momentum of consumption slowed down with a decline in income growth. The growth of retail sales fell to 2.6% in Q2 2024 from 4.7% in Q1. At its July meeting, the Politburo pointed out that consumption would be the core engine to boost domestic demand. Consumption is expected to recover moderately in H2 2024. \u2022 Manufacturing investments held up relatively well, with a growth rate of 9.3% in Q2 2024. The expansion of equipment renewals is expected to sustain robust growth in manufacturing investment. \u2022 Growth in infrastructure investment dropped slightly to 7.2% in Q2 2024 from 8.8% in Q1. Government investment slowed down due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. With issuances of local government special bonds and extra long-term special treasury bonds speeding up, however, infrastructure investment is expected to remain robust.\n\u2022 The property market is still struggling with weak sales and sluggish investment. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2 2024. To further raise housing demand and promote activity in the property market, policies to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory will be implemented in H2 2024.\n\u2022 Thanks to continuous improvement in external demand, exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with robust growth of 5.8% YoY in Q2. China\u2019s trade with emerging markets has seen fast growth, reflecting strengthened regional collaborations. Meanwhile, the optimisation of the structure of export commodities continues. Exports are expected to remain resilient through 2024. \u2022 Overall, driven by the implementation of equipment renewal policies and the recovery of external demand, China\u2019s GDP growth remained relatively stable in H1 2024. However, it is worth noting that domestic demand is still insufficient. The downturn in prices has had a direct effect on incomes, corporate profits and fiscal revenues, constraining spending. In addition, growing foreign trade tensions may weigh on China\u2019s exports. The government is expected to adopt a more accommodative macro policy stance in H2 2024 to facilitate the recovery of economic growth. 3 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

China\u2019s economic recovery momentum slowed down in Q2 Growth rate of major economic indicators, YoY, % Source: Wind, KPMG analysis Note: growth of GDP, industrial production, and income per capita are in real terms, and others are in nominal terms. \u2022 China\u2019s GDP grew 5% year-on-year in H1 2024, reaching the target set at the Two Sessions. However, the growth rate in Q2 dropped to 4.7% in Q2 from 5.3% in Q1, which was lower than expectations. Beyond challenges posed by extreme weather, the slowdown reflected sluggish domestic demand.\n\u2022 The contribution of consumption to GDP fell from 73.7% in Q1 to 46.5% in Q2. Retail sales growth plummeted to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1 due to weakness in incomes. Fixed asset investment growth dropped to 3.6% in Q2, with activity in the real estate market remaining subdued and infrastructure investment constrained by shortages in fiscal funds.\n\u2022 Export growth picked up from 1.5% in Q1 to 5.8% in Q2 due to a lower base and robust external demand. 2020-23 Average 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 GDP 4.8% 6.3% 4.9% 5.2% 5.3% 4.7% Industrial production 5.0% 4.5% 4.2% 5.2% 6.1% 5.9% Retail sales 4.1% 10.7% 4.2% 8.3% 4.7% 2.6% Fixed asset investment 4.4% 3.1% 1.9% 2.7% 4.5% 3.6% Exports 9.0% -4.9% -9.9% -1.2% 1.5% 5.8% Imports 6.4% -7.0% -8.5% 0.9% 1.6% 2.5% Income per capita 4.8% 8.3% 6.1% 6.7% 6.2% 4.2% Fiscal revenue 4.6% 31.7% -0.9% -1.0% -2.3% -3.2% Fiscal expenditures 3.7% 1.0% 4.1% 9.2% 2.9% 1.1% 4 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Extreme weather and weak demand still weighed on production side Manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI Source: Wind, KPMG analysis \u2022 The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 for the past three months, since April, and fell to 49.4 in July. The divergence between production and demand recovery persisted. The production index dropped 0.5 to 50.1 while the new orders index fell to 49.3 in July, declining below the 50 point mark. A reading under 50 indicates a contraction.\n\u2022 The non-manufacturing sector also slowed down. Affected by extreme weather, construction activity slowed in July and the Construction PMI dropped 1.1 points to 51.2. With capital markets and the real estate industry still sluggish, the services PMI index dropped to 50, reaching its lowest level for the year.\n20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Manufacturing Construction and Services 5 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Consumption slowed as residents\u2019 income growth declined Growth of retail sales by category, YoY, % \u2022 Consumption has continued a pattern of differentiated recovery since 2023, with services sales increasing 7.5% YoY in H1 2024, 4.3 percentage points higher than goods sales growth.

Here are some takeaways from the decision and from remarks by the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell.\n\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision lowers rates to about 4.9 percent, down from a more than two-decade high.\n\n\nFed officials lowered interest rates because they are confident that inflation is coming back down to their 2 percent goal, and now they want to prevent the job market from softening further.\n\n\nCentral bankers expect to cut interest rates more in the months to come, but they are not on a preset path, Mr. Powell said. They could speed up if the economy is weak and slow down if it\u2019s strong.\n\n\nThe Fed is keeping a wary eye on the uptick in unemployment, but for now it thinks the economy is basically strong.\n\n\nThe Fed is feeling \u201cgrowing confidence\u201d that it can pull off the soft economic landing by lowering interest rates.\n\n\nIn short, the Fed has pivoted to its rate cutting era, and there is more to come.\n\n\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 4:04 p.m. ET\nDanielle Kaye\nReporting from New York\nThe S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both closed roughly 0.3 percent lower, a modest drop, after rising earlier in the day on the news of the half-percentage rate cut.

Many economists said at the time that the report showed that the Fed should have cut rates \u2014 and Powell just suggested he agrees with them. If they had gotten the jobs report before their meeting, he said, \u201cwe might well have\u201d cut rates.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nOne interpretation of today\u2019s half-point cut is that it is making up for the quarter-point cut the Fed didn\u2019t make in July. Powell hasn\u2019t endorsed that interpretation, but he hasn\u2019t exactly rejected it either.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET\nJoe Rennison\nReporting from New York\nStocks have eased and the S&P 500 is now down for the day.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nThe real problem when it comes to housing, Powell says, is the lack of supply \u2014 a long-term problem that is outside of the Fed\u2019s control.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell is asked about housing inflation, which has proved stubborn even as other consumer prices have risen more slowly. He says that the process has been slower than expected, but that data suggests that rents are easing, and that he is confident housing inflation will ultimately cool.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nThe \u2018dot plot\u2019 shows more rate cuts are coming, but disagreement on how many.\nFederal Reserve officials agree that Wednesday\u2019s rate cut is unlikely to be their last. They are much less united on how far or how quickly they will decide to lower rates moving forward.\nThe chart below, known as the \u201cdot plot,\u201d helps tell the story.

That suggests those officials expect to make more modest, quarter-size cuts in each of the two meetings they have scheduled for the rest of the year.\nBut seven policymakers expect just one more cut this year, and two officials expect none. At the other end of the spectrum, one official expects the Fed to cut rates by another three-quarters of a point this year, suggesting another supersize reduction in either November or December.\nAll 19 officials expect rates to be lower at the end of next year than they are now. But their estimates of how much lower vary widely, from about 2.9 percent (two full percentage points below where they are after Wednesday\u2019s action) to 4.1 percent (just three-quarters of a point below where they are now). There is an even wider range of views in 2026 and 2027.\nEventually, most officials expect interest rates to settle between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. That\u2019s higher than in the decade before the pandemic, when the Fed\u2019s target interest rate never topped 2.5 percent \u2014 suggesting we may not soon return to the era of ultralow rates that prevailed after the Great Recession.\nShow more\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:04 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell tries to make clear that the politics of cutting rates right before a presidential election is not something the Fed thinks about, even though Trump has said any move ahead of November would be political. \u201cThis really concentrates the mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t put up any other filters. If you start doing that, I don\u2019t know where you stop.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:02 p.m. ET\nJim Tankersley\nReporting from Washington\nNo surprise that Powell was asked about the political optics of this decision.

Powell seems to think so. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not going back to that era where there are trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds being issued at negative rates,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cMy own sense is that we\u2019re not going back to that.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell is asked about whether he would be content if the economy continued to add around 100,000 jobs a month, and he responds that it depends on how many people are entering the labor market. The high rate of immigration in recent years has raised that so-called \u201cbreakeven rate,\u201d which is the pace at which employers need to add jobs to prevent the unemployment rate from rising further \u2014 some have estimated it\u2019s now about 175,000 jobs a month.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nJeanna Smialek\nReporting from Washington\nPowell is making very sure to emphasize that the job market is still strong today. He\u2019s walking a tricky line here. There were some concerns coming into this press conference that investors would read a big rate cut today as a sign that the Fed was freaking out about the job market. Powell is pushing back on that with all of this confident talk.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nIt\u2019s striking how many of the questions in the news conference so far have focused on the job market, rather than inflation.

That may be viewed as a pleasant surprise.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET\nDanielle Kaye\nReporting from New York\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said markets \u201ccan and should only celebrate today\u2019s move \u2013 and will continue to celebrate over coming months.\u201d The S&P 500 hovered near its record high this afternoon, and the index is now up roughly 0.5 percent as Powell speaks.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell notes that layoffs are still low. But as I explained in a story last week, low layoffs don\u2019t necessarily indicate a healthy labor market. It is the rate of hiring, more than the rate of layoffs, that often drives fluctuations in unemployment.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:53 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell is leaning into the argument that a strong labor market is a good time to cut rates. \u201cThere is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when it\u2019s strong, and not when you begin to see the layoffs,\u201d he said, noting that initial claims for unemployment insurance are pretty flat.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:52 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell acknowledges that the labor market is, by many measures, weaker than it was immediately before the pandemic.

The EU unemployment rate was 6.0% in March 2024, down from 6.1% in February 2024 and stable compared to March 2023. Eurostat estimates that 13.258 million persons in the EU, including 11.087 million in the euro area, were unemployed in March 2024. Compared to February 2024, unemployment decreased by 74 thousand in the EU and by 94 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, unemployment increased by 175 thousand in the EU and decreased by 51 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, 2.858 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU, including 2.259 million in the euro area. The youth unemployment rate was 14.6% in the EU, down from 14.7% in February 2024, and 14.1% in the euro area, down from 14.4% in the previous month.

In the euro area, the unemployment rate for women was 7.0%, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 6.0%, down from 6.1% in the previous month.\n\nThe estimates are based on the International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard definition of unemployment, which includes people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks. Additional indicators such as underemployed part-time workers and persons seeking work but not immediately available are also considered.\n\nThe document includes detailed tables showing seasonally adjusted unemployment rates and the number of unemployed persons in thousands for the euro area, EU, and individual countries from March 2023 to March 2024.

    "Summarized_Document2": "China\u2019s GDP grew 5% year-over-year (YoY) in H1 2024, meeting the target set at the Two Sessions. However, the growth rate in Q2 2024 dropped to 4.7% from 5.3% in Q1, falling short of market expectations due to extreme weather, adjustments in financial industry valuations, and sluggish domestic demand. Retail sales growth fell to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1, reflecting a slowdown in income growth. Manufacturing investments grew by 9.3% in Q2, supported by equipment renewals, while infrastructure investment growth dropped to 7.2% from 8.8% in Q1 due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2, with policies expected to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory in H2 2024. Exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with a robust 5.8% growth in Q2, driven by strong external demand and regional collaborations. Despite stable GDP growth in H1 2024, domestic demand remains insufficient, and foreign trade tensions may impact exports. The government is expected to adopt more accommodative macro policies in H2 2024 to support economic recovery. The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 since April, indicating contraction, while the non-manufacturing sector also slowed due to extreme weather. Consumption growth slowed as residents' income growth declined, with the per capita disposable income increasing by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. Manufacturing investment growth was driven by exports and equipment renewals, despite a slight drop to 9.3% in Q2 from 9.9% in Q1. Infrastructure investment growth fell to 7.2% in Q2 from 8.8% in Q1, constrained by extreme weather and fiscal funding shortages. General fiscal revenue growth dropped to -7.2% YoY in Q2, leading to a reduction in government expenditures. Property sales showed limited improvement, with investment growth dropping to -10.5% in Q2. Liquidity pressure on property developers persisted, with funding sources growth picking up slightly to -22.6% in H1 2024. CPI rose by 0.2% YoY in June 2024, while PPI decline narrowed, indicating moderate inflation expectations. Growth of total social financing slowed, with new bank loans decreasing by RMB 3.1 trillion in H1 2024. The central bank cut key interest rates to signal accommodative policies. Exports to major trading partners grew, with ASEAN remaining the largest trading partner. The export commodity structure continued to optimize, with mechanical and electrical products leading growth. FDI into China decreased by 29.1% YoY in H1 2024, while ODI grew by 19.5%. The RMB exchange rate remained stable despite global monetary policy divergence.

    "Summarized_Document3": "The Federal Reserve announced a significant interest rate cut on September 18, 2024, reducing rates by half a percentage point. This decision lowered the rates to approximately 4.9 percent, down from a more than two-decade high. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that future rate cuts would be considered on a 'meeting by meeting' basis, reflecting confidence that inflation is moving towards the 2 percent target. The Fed aims to prevent further softening of the job market while maintaining economic stability. Despite the larger-than-usual rate cut, the market reaction was modest, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing about 0.3 percent lower. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged the positive impact on inflation but stressed the need for continued efforts to reduce prices. Some economists believe the Fed's decision compensates for not cutting rates in July, following a disappointing jobs report. The 'dot plot' indicates that more rate cuts are expected, though there is disagreement among Fed officials on the extent and timing. Most officials anticipate rates to settle between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent in the long term, higher than pre-pandemic levels. Powell dismissed political considerations, focusing on the economic benefits of the rate cut. He also noted that the era of ultralow interest rates is likely over, and the labor market remains strong despite some weaknesses compared to pre-pandemic conditions.",

It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\nPerhaps the \"most encouraging\" news for consumers is that inflation for household necessities has cooled dramatically, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n\"The prices for staples \u00e2\u20ac\u201d food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they haven't changed in about a year,\" Zandi said. \"So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.\"\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n\"We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,\" Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week.\nHowever, additional improvements are likely to be \"slow-going,\" they wrote.\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their\u00c2\u00a0highest level\u00c2\u00a0in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation.\nLast month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024.\n\"All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,\" Zandi said.\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\nGasoline played a large role in June's inflation pullback.\nPrices fell 3.8% in June relative to May, according to CPI data. That follows a 3.6% decline the prior month.\n\"Tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs\" have led to weaker gas prices, AAA wrote in June.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why Fed policy may make your next trip abroad more expensiveInflation largely isn't Biden or Trump's fault, say economistsMore Americans are struggling even as inflation cools\nAverage U.S. pump prices fell to $3.48 a gallon as of July 1, down from $3.52 on June 3, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.\nGasoline prices are down 2.5% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store.\n\"Food at home\" prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nConsumers have more \"breathing room\" at the store amid \"growing promotional activity\" among retailers, while a few \"major\" companies recently announced price cuts \"that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,\" wrote economists House and George.\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends.\nThey also generally like to examine \"core\" inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThe monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.\n\"Core\" CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI.\nShelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said.\nThe shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it.\nHowever, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021.\n\"It should continue to cool off,\" said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n\"It just takes time,\" he added.\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment.\nIt is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment.\n\"The goods side looks very benign at the moment,\" said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. \"Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.\"\nFor example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a \"notable\" 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\nIt also takes a long time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a year, two or even three \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\nThe services sector is generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market such as strong wage growth.\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades. The labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though it remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n\"Inflationary pressure from the labor market has dissipated quite strongly,\" Cross said.\nDon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

The EU unemployment rate was 6.0% in March 2024, down from 6.1% in February 2024 and stable compared with March 2023. These figures are published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union.\nEurostat estimates that 13.258 million persons in the EU, of whom 11.087 million in the euro area, were unemployed in March 2024.\nCompared with February 2024, unemployment decreased by 74 thousand in the EU and by 94 thousand in the euro area.\nCompared with March 2023, unemployment increased by 175 thousand in the EU and decreased by 51 thousand in the euro area.\n\nYouth unemployment\nIn March 2024, 2.858 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU, of whom 2.259 million were in the euro area. In March 2024, the youth unemployment rate was 14.6% in the EU, down from 14.7% in February 2024, and 14.1% in the euro area, down from 14.4% in the previous month.\nCompared with February 2024, youth unemployment decreased by 11\u00a0thousand in the EU and by 30 thousand in the euro area.\nCompared with March 2023, youth unemployment increased by 150 thousand in the EU and by 36 thousand in the euro area.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nUnemployment by sex\nIn March 2024, the unemployment rate for women was 6.4% in the EU, stable compared with February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 5.7%, down from 5.8% in the previous month. In the euro area, the unemployment rate for women was 7.0%, stable compared with February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 6.0%, down from 6.1% in the previous month.\nAdditional labour market indicators\nThe estimates in this News Release are based on the globally used International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard definition of unemployment, which counts as unemployed people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks.\nTo capture in full the labour market situation, the data on unemployment have been complemented by additional indicators, e.g. underemployed part-time workers, persons seeking work but not immediately available and persons available to work but not seeking, released together with LFS data for the fourth quarter of 2023.\nLFS data for the first quarter of 2024 will be released on 14 June 2024.\nTables\nSeasonally adjusted unemployment, totals\n\nRates

series whenever new monthly data are added; the inclusion of the most recent LFS data in the calculation process; update of seasonal adjustment models with complete annual data.\nCompared with the rates published in News Release of 3 April 2024, the February 2024 unemployment rate for the EU has been revised from 6.0% to 6.1%, while the unemployment rate for the euro area remained unchanged. Among EU Member States, the rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) upwards for Spain (by 0.3 pp) as well as for Finland and Sweden (by 0.2 pp each). The rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) downwards for Greece (by 0.2 pp).\nCountry notes\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden as well as Iceland and Norway: the trend component is used instead of the more volatile seasonally adjusted data.\nEstonia and Portugal: 3-month moving averages of LFS data are used instead of pure monthly indicators.\nMethods and definitions\nEurostat publishes harmonised unemployment rates for individual EU Member States, the euro area and the EU. These unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The measurement is based on a harmonised data source, the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS).\nBased on the ILO definition, Eurostat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:\nare without work;\nare available to start work within the next two weeks;\nand have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks.\nThe unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.\nThe labour force is the total number of people employed plus unemployed. In this news release unemployment rates are based on employment and unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74.\nThe youth unemployment rate is the number of people aged 15 to 24 unemployed as a percentage of the labour force of the same age. Therefore, the youth unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the share of jobless people in the overall youth population.\nWhen data for the most recent month are not available for a Member State, EU and EA aggregates are calculated using the latest data available for that Member State.\nGeographical information\nEuro area (EA20): Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.\nEuropean Union (EU27): Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden.\nFor more information\nEurostat website section on employment and unemployment\nEurostat database section on unemployment, including non-seasonally adjusted and trend data\nStatistics Explained articles on unemployment\nEurostat metadata on adjusted unemployment series\nEuro indicators dashboard\nRelease calendar for Euro indicators\nEuropean Statistics Code of Practice\nGet in touch\nMedia requests\n\n\n\n\nEurostat Media Support\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 33 408\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: eurostat-mediasupport@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nFurther information on data\n\n\n\n\nThibaut HENRION\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 31 686\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevena CHOLAKOVA\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 35 304\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: estat-monthly-unemployment@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nShare the release\n\nWas this page useful?                \nIf you do not wish to provide more detailed feedback, please just click on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button to send your response. \n\nNeed help?                    \n\nFollow us                    \n\nContact the EU                    \n\nSocial media                    \n\nLegal                    \n\nEU institutions                    \n\n                        EU institutions\n                    \n",

Powell, the Fed chair, said that the central bank would take future interest rate cuts \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d after lowering rates by a half percentage point, an unusually large move.\nToday, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by a half percentage point. Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends. Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. We\u2019re going to take it meeting by meeting. As I mentioned, there\u2019s no sense that the committee feels it\u2019s in a rush to do this. We made a good, strong start to this, and that\u2019s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence \u2014 confidence that inflation is coming down.\n\nJerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said that the central bank would take future interest rate cuts \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d after lowering rates by a half percentage point, an unusually large move.CreditCredit...Tom Brenner/Reuters\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday by half a percentage point. Here are some takeaways from the decision and from remarks by the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell.\n\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision lowers rates to about 4.9 percent, down from a more than two-decade high.\n\n\nFed officials lowered interest rates because they are confident that inflation is coming back down to their 2 percent goal, and now they want to prevent the job market from softening further.\n\n\nCentral bankers expect to cut interest rates more in the months to come, but they are not on a preset path, Mr. Powell said. They could speed up if the economy is weak and slow down if it\u2019s strong.\n\n\nThe Fed is keeping a wary eye on the uptick in unemployment, but for now it thinks the economy is basically strong.\n\n\nThe Fed is feeling \u201cgrowing confidence\u201d that it can pull off the soft economic landing by lowering interest rates.\n\n\nIn short, the Fed has pivoted to its rate cutting era, and there is more to come.\n\n\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 4:04 p.m. ET\nDanielle Kaye\nReporting from New York\nThe S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both closed roughly 0.3 percent lower, a modest drop, after rising earlier in the day on the news of the half-percentage rate cut. Overall, the market doesn\u2019t seem spooked by the larger-than-usual rate cut. Investors had already bet on this bigger move, and the Fed\u2019s messaging \u2013 that it wasn\u2019t an emergency cut \u2013 also offered reassurance.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET\nAlan Rappeport\nReporting from Washington\nVice President Kamala Harris is out with a statement that makes clear she is not ready to declare \u201cmission accomplished\u201d on inflation. \u201cWhile this announcement is welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices, my focus is on the work ahead to keep bringing prices down,\u201d she said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:23 p.m. ET\nJeanna Smialek\nReporting from Washington\nPowell has finished his press conference.

Many economists said at the time that the report showed that the Fed should have cut rates \u2014 and Powell just suggested he agrees with them. If they had gotten the jobs report before their meeting, he said, \u201cwe might well have\u201d cut rates.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nOne interpretation of today\u2019s half-point cut is that it is making up for the quarter-point cut the Fed didn\u2019t make in July. Powell hasn\u2019t endorsed that interpretation, but he hasn\u2019t exactly rejected it either.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET\nJoe Rennison\nReporting from New York\nStocks have eased and the S&P 500 is now down for the day.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nThe real problem when it comes to housing, Powell says, is the lack of supply \u2014 a long-term problem that is outside of the Fed\u2019s control.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell is asked about housing inflation, which has proved stubborn even as other consumer prices have risen more slowly. He says that the process has been slower than expected, but that data suggests that rents are easing, and that he is confident housing inflation will ultimately cool.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nThe \u2018dot plot\u2019 shows more rate cuts are coming, but disagreement on how many.\nFederal Reserve officials agree that Wednesday\u2019s rate cut is unlikely to be their last.

That suggests those officials expect to make more modest, quarter-size cuts in each of the two meetings they have scheduled for the rest of the year.\nBut seven policymakers expect just one more cut this year, and two officials expect none. At the other end of the spectrum, one official expects the Fed to cut rates by another three-quarters of a point this year, suggesting another supersize reduction in either November or December.\nAll 19 officials expect rates to be lower at the end of next year than they are now. But their estimates of how much lower vary widely, from about 2.9 percent (two full percentage points below where they are after Wednesday\u2019s action) to 4.1 percent (just three-quarters of a point below where they are now). There is an even wider range of views in 2026 and 2027.\nEventually, most officials expect interest rates to settle between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. That\u2019s higher than in the decade before the pandemic, when the Fed\u2019s target interest rate never topped 2.5 percent \u2014 suggesting we may not soon return to the era of ultralow rates that prevailed after the Great Recession.\nShow more\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:04 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell tries to make clear that the politics of cutting rates right before a presidential election is not something the Fed thinks about, even though Trump has said any move ahead of November would be political. \u201cThis really concentrates the mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t put up any other filters. If you start doing that, I don\u2019t know where you stop.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:02 p.m. ET\nJim Tankersley\nReporting from Washington\nNo surprise that Powell was asked about the political optics of this decision. And no surprise his answer is, what we care about it doing the best thing for the American people and the economy.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:02 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nIs the era of ultralow interest rates gone for good? Powell seems to think so. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not going back to that era where there are trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds being issued at negative rates,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cMy own sense is that we\u2019re not going back to that.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell is asked about whether he would be content if the economy continued to add around 100,000 jobs a month, and he responds that it depends on how many people are entering the labor market. The high rate of immigration in recent years has raised that so-called \u201cbreakeven rate,\u201d which is the pace at which employers need to add jobs to prevent the unemployment rate from rising further \u2014 some have estimated it\u2019s now about 175,000 jobs a month.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nJeanna Smialek\nReporting from Washington\nPowell is making very sure to emphasize that the job market is still strong today. He\u2019s walking a tricky line here. There were some concerns coming into this press conference that investors would read a big rate cut today as a sign that the Fed was freaking out about the job market. Powell is pushing back on that with all of this confident talk.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nIt\u2019s striking how many of the questions in the news conference so far have focused on the job market, rather than inflation. It\u2019s another sign of how the narrative around the economy has shifted.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:58 p.m. ET\nTalmon Joseph Smith\nPowell mentioned that average wage growth for workers is still somewhat above what most officials see as being \u201cconsistent with price stability.\u201d One of the things I\u2019ll be watching in the next several months, though, is whether inflation continues to slowly cool even as wage growth remains strong. That may be viewed as a pleasant surprise.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET\nDanielle Kaye\nReporting from New York\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said markets \u201ccan and should only celebrate today\u2019s move \u2013 and will continue to celebrate over coming months.\u201d The S&P 500 hovered near its record high this afternoon, and the index is now up roughly 0.5 percent as Powell speaks.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell notes that layoffs are still low. But as I explained in a story last week, low layoffs don\u2019t necessarily indicate a healthy labor market. It is the rate of hiring, more than the rate of layoffs, that often drives fluctuations in unemployment.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:53 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell is leaning into the argument that a strong labor market is a good time to cut rates. \u201cThere is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when it\u2019s strong, and not when you begin to see the layoffs,\u201d he said, noting that initial claims for unemployment insurance are pretty flat.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:52 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell acknowledges that the labor market is, by many measures, weaker than it was immediately before the pandemic.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Here's the inflation breakdown for June 2024 \u2014 in one chart\nInflation fell further in June as lower gasoline prices combined with other easing price pressures to bring relief for consumers' wallets.\nThe consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 3% in June from a year ago, down from 3.3% in May, the U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday.\nThe CPI gauges how fast prices are changing across the U.S. economy. It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\nPerhaps the 'most encouraging' news for consumers is that inflation for household necessities has cooled dramatically, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n'The prices for staples \u2014 food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \u2014 they haven't changed in about a year,' Zandi said. 'So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.'\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n'We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,' Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week.\nHowever, additional improvements are likely to be 'slow-going,' they wrote.\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their highest level in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation.\nLast month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024.\n'All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,' Zandi said.\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\nGasoline played a large role in June's inflation pullback.\nPrices fell 3.8% in June relative to May, according to CPI data. That follows a 3.6% decline the prior month.\n'Tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs' have led to weaker gas prices, AAA wrote in June.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why Fed policy may make your next trip abroad more expensiveInflation largely isn't Biden or Trump's fault, say economistsMore Americans are struggling even as inflation cools\nAverage U.S. pump prices fell to $3.48 a gallon as of July 1, down from $3.52 on June 3, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.\nGasoline prices are down 2.5% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store.\n'Food at home' prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nConsumers have more 'breathing room' at the store amid 'growing promotional activity' among retailers, while a few 'major' companies recently announced price cuts 'that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,' wrote economists House and George.\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends.\nThey also generally like to examine 'core' inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThe monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.\n'Core' CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI.\nShelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said.\nThe shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it.\nHowever, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \u2014 lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \u2014 from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021.\n'It should continue to cool off,' said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n'It just takes time,' he added.\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment.\nIt is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment.\n'The goods side looks very benign at the moment,' said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. 'Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.'\nFor example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a 'notable' 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\nIt also takes a long time \u2014 a year, two or even three \u2014 for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\nThe services sector is generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market such as strong wage growth.\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades. The labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though it remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n'Inflationary pressure from the labor market has dissipated quite strongly,' Cross said.\nDon't miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

    "Summarized_Document2": "In March 2024, the euro area seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 6.5%, stable compared to February 2024 and down from 6.6% in March 2023. The EU unemployment rate was 6.0% in March 2024, down from 6.1% in February 2024 and stable compared to March 2023. Eurostat estimates that 13.258 million persons in the EU, including 11.087 million in the euro area, were unemployed in March 2024. Compared to February 2024, unemployment decreased by 74 thousand in the EU and by 94 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, unemployment increased by 175 thousand in the EU and decreased by 51 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, 2.858 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU, including 2.259 million in the euro area. The youth unemployment rate was 14.6% in the EU, down from 14.7% in February 2024, and 14.1% in the euro area, down from 14.4% in the previous month. Compared to February 2024, youth unemployment decreased by 11 thousand in the EU and by 30 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, youth unemployment increased by 150 thousand in the EU and by 36 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, the unemployment rate for women was 6.4% in the EU, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 5.7%, down from 5.8% in the previous month. In the euro area, the unemployment rate for women was 7.0%, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 6.0%, down from 6.1% in the previous month.\n\nThe estimates are based on the International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard definition of unemployment, which includes people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks. Additional indicators such as underemployed part-time workers and persons seeking work but not immediately available are also considered.\n\nThe document includes detailed tables showing seasonally adjusted unemployment rates and the number of unemployed persons in thousands for the euro area, EU, and individual countries from March 2023 to March 2024. For example, in March 2024, Germany had an unemployment rate of 3.2% with 1,421 thousand unemployed persons, while Spain had an unemployment rate of 11.7% with 2,854 thousand unemployed persons.\n\nYouth unemployment rates and numbers are also detailed, with the euro area having a youth unemployment rate of 14.1% in March 2024, down from 14.4% in February 2024, and the EU having a rate of 14.6%, down from 14.7% in February 2024. For instance, in March 2024, Spain had a youth unemployment rate of 27.2% with 480 thousand unemployed young persons, while Germany had a rate of 5.8% with 263 thousand unemployed young persons.\n\nUnemployment rates by gender are provided, showing that in March 2024, the euro area had an unemployment rate of 6.0% for men and 7.0% for women, while the EU had rates of 5.7% for men and 6.4% for women.\n\nThe document also notes that the data can be subject to revisions and provides information on the methods and definitions used by Eurostat, including the ILO definition of unemployment and the calculation of unemployment rates. It lists the countries included in the euro area (EA20) and the European Union (EU27) and provides contact information for further inquiries.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "The Federal Reserve announced a significant interest rate cut on September 18, 2024, reducing rates by half a percentage point. This decision lowered the rates to approximately 4.9 percent, down from a more than two-decade high. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that future rate cuts would be considered on a 'meeting by meeting' basis, reflecting confidence that inflation is moving towards the 2 percent target. The Fed aims to prevent further softening of the job market while maintaining economic stability. Despite the larger-than-usual rate cut, the market reaction was modest, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing about 0.3 percent lower. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged the positive impact on inflation but stressed the need for continued efforts to reduce prices. Some economists believe the Fed's decision compensates for not cutting rates in July, following a disappointing jobs report. The 'dot plot' indicates that more rate cuts are expected, though there is disagreement among Fed officials on the extent and timing. Most officials anticipate rates to settle between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent in the long term, higher than pre-pandemic levels. Powell dismissed political considerations, focusing on the economic benefits of the rate cut. He also noted that the era of ultralow interest rates is likely over, and the labor market remains strong despite some weaknesses compared to pre-pandemic conditions.",

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

However, due to rising rates of mental illness, more public awareness of depression, rising healthcare costs, and an increase in clinical trials, North America is predicted to see the greatest CAGR of xx% between 2024 and 2031. Spending on mental health and healthcare are strongly related in Canada. The Canadian healthcare system places a high priority on mental health, and a sizable portion of its budget is allocated to services and initiatives in this area. This covers the cost of prescription drugs for mental health disorders as well as the cost of mental health treatments rendered in community-based settings, hospitals, and outpatient clinics. The rising demand for antidepressant drugs affects market prices as well. Patients may find antidepressants to be more affordable because many of them are available in generic form.\u00a0\nWhich Region is Expanding at the Fastest CAGR?\nAsia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth in the antidepressant drugs market during the forecast period. Changes in the financial system, societal norms, and lifestyle might increase the likelihood of mental health issues like depression, which in turn drives up the need for antidepressant drugs.

The market provides the value (in USD million) for the above-mentioned segments.\n\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Analysis\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is expected to register a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period (2021 to 2026).\nThe COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on people with hypertension. Also, due to lockdown and other restrictions imposed by governements to curb the spread of the infection from the Covid-19 virus, the lifestyle of patients with hypertension was severely impacted. As per the study titled \"COVID-19 in Patients with Hypertension\" published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology in July 2021, hypertension individuals who have COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality that is at least two times higher; nevertheless, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors that have been offer protection for this subgroup of patients which in turn expected to boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nOne of the leading factors responsible for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market is the rising prevalence of hypertension among people around the world. The major known causes of hypertension are kidney diseases, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and other cardiovascular diseases due to which the prevalence of hypertension has been observed a significant rise over the past few years. Also, some drugs can induce hypertension in patients with other diseases or disorders which in turn is expected to promote the growth of the studied market. As per the updated May 2021 data from the World Health Organization, about 1.13 billion people around the world have hypertension, of which two-third are living in low- and middle-income countries. In the report published in June 2020 titled 'A Global View on Prevalence of Hypertension and Human Development Index' to determine the relationship between the prevalence of hypertension and human development index (HDI) concluded that the prevalence of hypertension ranged from 35% to 41% among 182 countries around the world. Thus, the rising prevalence of hypertension is expected to drive the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nCertain other factors that will boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market include growing initiatives by private and government organizations and rising awareness about hypertension around the around. For instance, in May 2022, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals conclude the hypertension awareness symbol backed by the Association of Physicians of India (API) and Hypertension Society of India (HIS). Additionally, in May 2022, Namya Smile Foundation (NSF) organized an awareness campaign in India related to hypertension among people. The organization conducted a camp and checked the blood pressure and made them aware of various aspects of high blood pressure.\nWhereas factors such as expiration of patent of multiple major drugs along with side effects associated with the hypertension treatment and rise in the availability of other non-pharmacological based therapy will restrict the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market. For Instance, In December 2021, AbbVie, the parent company of Allergan, lost the patent of its anti-hypertensive drug, Bystolic (Nebivolol). Nebivolol is a beta blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Additionally, market participants frequently introduce new products and use a variety of growth tactics in their particular segments, which is likely to spur market expansion. For Instance, in December 2021, Dr Reddy's Laboratories has launched Valsartan tablets, used for treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, in the United States market. The Valsartan tablet is the generic therapeutic equivalent of Diovan, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Similarly, in November 2021, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. reported that Novartis Pharma K.K. (Novartis Pharma) has obtained approval in Japan for ENTREST 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets (generic name: sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate) for the new indication of hypertension. This approval is Japan's first of an ARNI for the indication of hypertension.\nThus, all aforementioned factors expected to boost the market growth over the forecast period, However, multiple major drug patent expiration expected to hamper the market growth.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Trends\n\n This section covers the major market trends shaping the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market according to our research experts: \n\nDiuretics Therapeutics Class is Expected to Hold a Significant Market Share in the Forecast Period\n\nDiuretics help in reducing the sodium and water from the body by inducing kidneys to release more sodium into the urine which leads to lower blood pressure as fluid flowing through the body is decreases. Diuretics are the preferred class of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of hypertension over others mainly because of their high efficacy, low cost, and low side effects as compared to other available therapeutic classes in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nDiuretics are of three types - thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics, from which thiazide diuretics are the cornerstone of treatment for hypertension in most patients around the world. For instance, as per the research article published in July 2022, titled 'Loop Diuretics', Loop diuretics have received FDA approval to be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensives to treat hypertension. However, first-line therapy does not consist solely of loop diuretics. Loop diuretics can be used to address fluid overload conditions and alternative hypertension therapy. Moreover, according to the study titled \"Thiazide diuretics alone or in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic on blood pressure-lowering in patients with primary hypertension: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis\" published in the BMC Open Journal in February 2022, Thiazides have a proven track record of lowering blood pressure, have a good safety record, and are inexpensive. This makes them a popular choice for pharmaceutical treatment. Hydrochlorothiazide has less antihypertensive effectiveness than chlorthalidone and indapamide. Thus,m due to above benefits of the diuretics in the management of hypertension is anticipated to boost the segmrent growth over the forecast period.\nTherefore, owing to the above-mentioned factors, the diuretics therapeutics class is expected to have highest growth as compared to others with the rise in the prevalence of hypertension cases around the world.\n\nNorth America is Expected to Dominate the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market Over the Forecast Period\n\nNorth America holds a major share in the anti-hypertensive drugs market and is expected to show a similar trend over the forecast period mainly due to the high prevalence of hypertension and diseases causing hypertension in the region. Additionally, the demand for prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, identifying people predisposed to the disease, presence of technically advanced healthcare infrastructure, and management of the prognosis of the disease are some of the key market drivers of the North American anti-hypertension market.\nIn North America, the United States will hold the largest market in anti-hypertensive drugs market in the region. In the United States, the rising prevalence of hypertension is the major reason for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drug market. As per the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention In July 2022, over half of adults (47 percent, or 116 million) have hypertension. Thus, the growing burden of hypertension in the United States is expected to rise in the demand anti-hypertensive drug thereby boost the market growth.\nThe other factors such as increasing awareness among the people about hypertension in the region. For instance, in November 2021, New public service announcements (PSAs) were released by the American Heart Association (AHA), American Medical Association (AMA), HHS Office of Minority Health (OMH), Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA), and the Ad Council to encourage people to take charge of their health by self-monitoring their blood pressure and talking with a healthcare provider about their numbers.\nAdditionally, various strategies adopted by the key market players such as product launches and merger and acquisistion supports the market growth. In April 2021, United Therapeutics Corporation announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration approved its drug for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease, known as Tyvaso (Treprostinil).\nThus, the North America is expected to hold major market share in the anti-hypertensive market.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Industry Overview\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is highly competitive due to the presence of a number of pharmaceutical companies. Companies such as AstraZeneca PLC, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko.

    "Summarized_Document3": "Antihypertensive Drugs Market Size & Share Analysis - Growth Trends & Forecasts (2024 - 2029)\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% from 2021 to 2026. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted individuals with hypertension, increasing the demand for anti-hypertensive drugs. The rising prevalence of hypertension, driven by factors such as kidney diseases, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, is a major growth driver. According to the World Health Organization, about 1.13 billion people globally have hypertension, with two-thirds living in low- and middle-income countries. The prevalence of hypertension ranges from 35% to 41% among 182 countries.\n\nPrivate and government initiatives are also boosting market growth. For example, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals and the Namya Smile Foundation have conducted awareness campaigns in India. However, the expiration of patents for major drugs and the side effects associated with hypertension treatments are expected to restrain market growth. For instance, AbbVie lost the patent for its drug Bystolic in December 2021.\n\nDiuretics are expected to hold a significant market share due to their high efficacy, low cost, and minimal side effects. Thiazide diuretics, in particular, are widely used for hypertension treatment. North America is expected to dominate the market, driven by the high prevalence of hypertension and advanced healthcare infrastructure. The United States, where 47% of adults have hypertension, will hold the largest market share in the region.\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is highly competitive, with major players including Pfizer Inc., C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, Noden Pharma DAC, Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, and Merck KGaA. The market is segmented by therapeutic class (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, alpha blockers, renin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and other therapeutic classes) and geography (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and South America).\n\nThe report covers market dynamics, including drivers such as the increasing prevalence of hypertension and growing awareness, and restraints like drug patent expirations and side effects. It also includes a competitive landscape analysis and profiles of key companies. The market is expected to see significant growth in Asia-Pacific due to rising health awareness and an aging population.",

    "Document1": "Los Angeles Lakers 2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nWill LeBron and his son, Bronny, hoist the Larry O'Brien together?\nMassimo Marchiano\nWe've got the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25 to see how the game thinks the team will perform this year. Last year, the Lakers finished the season 47-35 and made the playoffs. However, they lost to the Denver Nuggets in the First Round in 5 games. Will they fare better this year? Let's find out.\nLos Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will go 48-34 in the regular season and make the playoffs. But before we show what happened in the postseason, let's see how they got there in the first place.\nOctober \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers' 2024-2025 season started on a rough note, with the team going 1-4 in October. The team performed well offensively, but the same couldn't be said about the defense. They managed to start the year 1-0 after beating Minnesota 111-103. But they instantly faced a fierce five-game losing streak that set them back.\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis led the team in minutes per game, points scored, and several other statistical categories. But as we can see, there'll need to be improvements from other players if they want to turn things around.\nNovember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe month of November was a bit better for the Lakers, but the team still struggled. As we mentioned, they suffered a loss to start the month, extending their losing streak to five. However, the Lakers went on to win seven of their next nine games to go 8-7. However, as soon as things were looking better, they lost four straight to end the month and end up being below .500 again.\nNothing was too different here than in October. While the team played well offensively, they allowed over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in a 14 game stretch. However, the season is still early and anything is possible.\nDecember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nBecause some games are still to be decided, a couple of games here do not reflect the actual 2024-2025 season. Instead of waiting for December to see the confirmed matchups, we just rocked with what NBA 2K25's MyNBA mode provided for us. The rest of the season does accurately reflect the real 2024-2024 schedule.\nAnyways, it was a better month for the Lakers who finally evened out their record. Additionally, the defense managed to buckle down and play better, though they still need to improve. However, thanks LeBron averaging over 27 points per game, the Lakers' offense is in good hands. We also got to see Bronny James play for the first time, though he only played for two minutes against the Kings near the end of the month.\nJanuary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers started off their New Year with a win to go above .500 for the first time this season. They went on to win two more games to extend their win streak to four games. Furthermore, this month saw the team win some important matchups, including a 1 point victory over the Celtics.\nIn fact, L.A. had three close games this month in which the winning team only won by 1 point. Another thing worth noting is the defensive improvement. This month they only allowed over 100 points in half of their matchups this month. It's not perfect, but the Lakers seemed to find a better rhythm in terms of defense.\nOverall, Davis and LeBron continue to be the superstars of this team. Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

(Photo by Lauren Sopourn/Getty Images)Getty Images\nDeandre Ayton and Matisse Thubulle returned to the rotation for the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night and were greeted rather rudely by the Miami Heat.\nThe Heat led 29-19 after the first quarter then went off for 45 points in the second quarter to lead 74-30 at halftime. The Blazers never remotely got back into the game and fell 142-82, the third most lopsided defeat in franchise history.\n\u201cIt was just a rough one,\u201d Blazers coach Chauncey Billups told reporters. \u201cIt was just a rough one for everybody.\u201d\nNot quite everybody. Ayton, who missed four games with elbow tendinitis, did all he could during a dreadful first half by scoring 16 points on 8-of-13 shooting.\n\u201cWe were happy to have him,\u201d Billups said. \u201cDA was his normal efficient self. He was very efficient and he was good on the glass. I\u2019m pretty sure he felt good just kind of getting back out there after being down for a while. I thought he did the best that he could.\u201d\nThe rest of the Blazers shot 10 of 32 (31.3%) from the field in the first half and 1 of 14 from three-point range while committing 10 turnovers.\nFor the game, the Blazers shot 39.8% from the field and 5 on 31 threes (16.1%). The Blazers committed 24 turnovers on the night.\nBillups briefly discussed how the Blazers started off playing clean basketball. They led 11-10 about four minutes into the game.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt happened pretty quick where we couldn\u2019t score. We couldn\u2019t get in the paint. We try to make a point, always, of getting the ball to the paint. Collapsing defenses and then create the chase, is what I call it.\u201d\nInstead, Miami prevented the Blazers from accomplishing their goal.\n\u201cTheir defense, they got physical,\u201d Billups said. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t get to the paint. And we just kind of settled, settled, settled. We turned it over. And we had a lot of what I call \u2018shooting turnovers,\u2019 which are just horrible shots that might as well be a turnover. And everything just kind of went bad at the same time.\u201d\nAyton, who played just over five minutes in the second half, finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 20 points with six assists but also committed seven turnovers.\nDalano Banton, who set a career high with 31 points during Wednesday\u2019s loss at Atlanta, shot just 5 of 19 against the Heat for 12 points.\nThe Heat did whatever they wanted on offense, shooting 59.3% from the field and 21 of 39 on threes (53.8%).\nThe Heat had six players with double-digit scoring, four over 20. Thomas Bryant led the Heat with 26 points off the bench. Terry Rozier scored 22 with six assists.\nWHAT IT MEANS\nThe Blazers (19-55) lost their ninth consecutive game to match their longest losing streak of the season. The Heat (40-33) remained in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, slightly ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (39-35).\nMONUMENTAL LOSS\nThe 60-point defeat is the third-worst in franchise history. Earlier this season, Portland lost 139-77 at Oklahoma City. That 62-point defeat ranks second all-time. The Blazers\u2019 worst loss in franchise history came Feb. 27, 1998, at Indiana by the score of 124-59 (65 points).\nMATISSE THYBULLE\nThe Blazers guard returned to action but didn\u2019t last long. Thybulle played seven minutes before leaving the game with a right ankle impingement. He had missed five games with an ankle injury leading up to Friday night.\nNEXT UP\nThe Blazers play at 4 p.m. Monday at the Orlando Magic.\nLatest Blazers news\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)\nMORE BLAZERS COVERAGE\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Here's a month-by-month breakdown of their performance:\n\nOctober: The Lakers started the season 1-4, struggling defensively despite strong offensive performances from LeBron James and Anthony Davis.\n\nNovember: The team improved slightly, going 8-7, but still faced defensive issues, allowing over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in 14 games.\n\nDecember: The Lakers evened out their record, with LeBron averaging over 27 points per game. Bronny James made his debut, playing two minutes against the Kings.\n\nJanuary: The Lakers went above .500 for the first time, winning several close games and showing defensive improvement. They ended the month with a four-game win streak.\n\nFebruary: The Lakers continued to build their record, going 16-11 in the first two months of the year. Austin Reaves scored 29 points in a win over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nMarch: The Lakers won 12 games, essentially clinching a playoff spot despite D'Angelo Russell's injury. LeBron continued to perform well, and Bronny made a brief appearance.\n\nApril: The Lakers secured the fifth seed in the playoffs despite a three-game losing streak. They ended the month with back-to-back wins.\n\nNBA Playoffs First Round: The Lakers overcame the San Antonio Spurs, with LeBron averaging 33 points per game. However, Anthony Davis suffered an ankle injury.\n\nNBA Playoffs Quarterfinals: The Lakers lost to the Dallas Mavericks due to Davis' injury and LeBron's reduced performance (23 points per game).\n\nOverall, the Lakers made it farther than last season but fell short of the NBA Finals. The season begins in October, and fans are hopeful for a strong performance.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Klay Thompson scored 27 points and Stephen Curry added 23 as the sharp-shooting Golden State Warriors inched closer to the host Los Angeles Lakers in the battle for play-in tournament seeding with a 134-120 victory on Tuesday, April 9 (Wednesday, April 10, Manila time). Golden State made a season-high 26 three-pointers (on 41 attempts), one made triple short of the franchise record, and won the season series with three wins in four games. Curry was 6-for-6 from distance and Draymond Green went 5-for-7 as the Warriors delivered the best three-point shooting percentage in a game in NBA history (63.4%) with a minimum of 40 long-range attempts, per ESPN Stats & Info. Andrew Wiggins scored 17 points and Green added 15 to go along with 10 assists as the Warriors (44-35) won for the eighth time in their past nine games. LeBron James scored 33 points and dished out 11 assists and Austin Reaves had 22 points for the Lakers (45-35), who lost consecutive games for just the second time since the start of February. It was Los Angeles\u2019 final home game of the regular season. The Lakers were playing without Anthony Davis, who took a blow to the side of the head in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves and still was experiencing nausea with a headache on Tuesday. Rui Hachimura supplied 20 points and 11 rebounds and D\u2019Angelo Russell scored 14 points for the Lakers, who had won nine of 10 games before dropping the last two, both at home. The ninth-seeded Lakers are now just a half-game ahead of the No. 10 Warriors. The No. 9 and 10 seeds face off in the play-in tournament, with that winner set to go up against the loser of the 7-8 game for the final Western Conference playoff spot. After an efficient first quarter where they went 7-for-10 from three-point range, the Warriors took a 38-29 lead. After making eight more triples in the second quarter, the Warriors had a 71-60 lead at halftime. The Warriors made 15 of their 22 attempts from three-point range in the first half (68.2%). The Lakers were within nine points at 109-100 with 9:25 remaining in the game before the Warriors got a three-pointer from Curry and a floater inside by Jonathan Kuminga for a 114-100 lead with 8:16 left, and the Lakers never threatened from there.",

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website.

Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

The higher the rate, the more it costs for a buyer to buy. When interest rates rise, it has the same effect as a seller raising his price and fewer homes sell because mortgage payments are higher.
