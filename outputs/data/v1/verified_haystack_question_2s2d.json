    "Document1": "Los Angeles Lakers 2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nWill LeBron and his son, Bronny, hoist the Larry O'Brien together?\nMassimo Marchiano\nWe've got the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25 to see how the game thinks the team will perform this year. Last year, the Lakers finished the season 47-35 and made the playoffs. However, they lost to the Denver Nuggets in the First Round in 5 games. Will they fare better this year? Let's find out.\nLos Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will go 48-34 in the regular season and make the playoffs. But before we show what happened in the postseason, let's see how they got there in the first place.\nOctober \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers' 2024-2025 season started on a rough note, with the team going 1-4 in October. The team performed well offensively, but the same couldn't be said about the defense. They managed to start the year 1-0 after beating Minnesota 111-103. But they instantly faced a fierce five-game losing streak that set them back.\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis led the team in minutes per game, points scored, and several other statistical categories. But as we can see, there'll need to be improvements from other players if they want to turn things around.\nNovember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe month of November was a bit better for the Lakers, but the team still struggled. As we mentioned, they suffered a loss to start the month, extending their losing streak to five. However, the Lakers went on to win seven of their next nine games to go 8-7. However, as soon as things were looking better, they lost four straight to end the month and end up being below .500 again.\nNothing was too different here than in October. While the team played well offensively, they allowed over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in a 14 game stretch. However, the season is still early and anything is possible.\nDecember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nBecause some games are still to be decided, a couple of games here do not reflect the actual 2024-2025 season. Instead of waiting for December to see the confirmed matchups, we just rocked with what NBA 2K25's MyNBA mode provided for us. The rest of the season does accurately reflect the real 2024-2024 schedule.\nAnyways, it was a better month for the Lakers who finally evened out their record. Additionally, the defense managed to buckle down and play better, though they still need to improve. However, thanks LeBron averaging over 27 points per game, the Lakers' offense is in good hands. We also got to see Bronny James play for the first time, though he only played for two minutes against the Kings near the end of the month.\nJanuary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers started off their New Year with a win to go above .500 for the first time this season. They went on to win two more games to extend their win streak to four games. Furthermore, this month saw the team win some important matchups, including a 1 point victory over the Celtics.\nIn fact, L.A. had three close games this month in which the winning team only won by 1 point. Another thing worth noting is the defensive improvement. This month they only allowed over 100 points in half of their matchups this month. It's not perfect, but the Lakers seemed to find a better rhythm in terms of defense.\nOverall, Davis and LeBron continue to be the superstars of this team. Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

(Photo by Lauren Sopourn/Getty Images)Getty Images\nDeandre Ayton and Matisse Thubulle returned to the rotation for the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night and were greeted rather rudely by the Miami Heat.\nThe Heat led 29-19 after the first quarter then went off for 45 points in the second quarter to lead 74-30 at halftime. The Blazers never remotely got back into the game and fell 142-82, the third most lopsided defeat in franchise history.\n\u201cIt was just a rough one,\u201d Blazers coach Chauncey Billups told reporters. \u201cIt was just a rough one for everybody.\u201d\nNot quite everybody. Ayton, who missed four games with elbow tendinitis, did all he could during a dreadful first half by scoring 16 points on 8-of-13 shooting.\n\u201cWe were happy to have him,\u201d Billups said. \u201cDA was his normal efficient self. He was very efficient and he was good on the glass. I\u2019m pretty sure he felt good just kind of getting back out there after being down for a while. I thought he did the best that he could.\u201d\nThe rest of the Blazers shot 10 of 32 (31.3%) from the field in the first half and 1 of 14 from three-point range while committing 10 turnovers.\nFor the game, the Blazers shot 39.8% from the field and 5 on 31 threes (16.1%). The Blazers committed 24 turnovers on the night.\nBillups briefly discussed how the Blazers started off playing clean basketball. They led 11-10 about four minutes into the game.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt happened pretty quick where we couldn\u2019t score. We couldn\u2019t get in the paint. We try to make a point, always, of getting the ball to the paint. Collapsing defenses and then create the chase, is what I call it.\u201d\nInstead, Miami prevented the Blazers from accomplishing their goal.\n\u201cTheir defense, they got physical,\u201d Billups said. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t get to the paint. And we just kind of settled, settled, settled. We turned it over. And we had a lot of what I call \u2018shooting turnovers,\u2019 which are just horrible shots that might as well be a turnover. And everything just kind of went bad at the same time.\u201d\nAyton, who played just over five minutes in the second half, finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 20 points with six assists but also committed seven turnovers.\nDalano Banton, who set a career high with 31 points during Wednesday\u2019s loss at Atlanta, shot just 5 of 19 against the Heat for 12 points.\nThe Heat did whatever they wanted on offense, shooting 59.3% from the field and 21 of 39 on threes (53.8%).\nThe Heat had six players with double-digit scoring, four over 20. Thomas Bryant led the Heat with 26 points off the bench. Terry Rozier scored 22 with six assists.\nWHAT IT MEANS\nThe Blazers (19-55) lost their ninth consecutive game to match their longest losing streak of the season. The Heat (40-33) remained in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, slightly ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (39-35).\nMONUMENTAL LOSS\nThe 60-point defeat is the third-worst in franchise history. Earlier this season, Portland lost 139-77 at Oklahoma City. That 62-point defeat ranks second all-time. The Blazers\u2019 worst loss in franchise history came Feb. 27, 1998, at Indiana by the score of 124-59 (65 points).\nMATISSE THYBULLE\nThe Blazers guard returned to action but didn\u2019t last long. Thybulle played seven minutes before leaving the game with a right ankle impingement. He had missed five games with an ankle injury leading up to Friday night.\nNEXT UP\nThe Blazers play at 4 p.m. Monday at the Orlando Magic.\nLatest Blazers news\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)\nMORE BLAZERS COVERAGE\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) both also affect agricultural output and both also show sensitivity to climate variability and change3,4,5,6,7,8,9. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts to agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield, but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nWarming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields\n                                        \n\n\nImpacts of recent climate change on crop yield can depend on local conditions in climatically diverse regions of Norway\n                                        \n\n\nContrasting area and yield responses to extreme climate contributes to climate-resilient rice production in Asia\n                                        \n\nReferences\nRosenzweig, C. et al.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The sensitivity of agricultural output to climate change has often been estimated by modeling crop yields under climate change scenarios or with statistical analysis of the impacts of year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields. However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) also affect agricultural output and show sensitivity to climate variability and change. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency, and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses, and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts on agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4. Difference from average Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) for the state of Kansas during the February 12-26, 2024 period as compared to the long-term average. Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) both also affect agricultural output and both also show sensitivity to climate variability and change3,4,5,6,7,8,9. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts to agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield, but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nWarming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields\n                                        \n\n\nImpacts of recent climate change on crop yield can depend on local conditions in climatically diverse regions of Norway\n                                        \n\n\nContrasting area and yield responses to extreme climate contributes to climate-resilient rice production in Asia\n                                        \n\nReferences\nRosenzweig, C. et al.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The sensitivity of agricultural output to climate change has often been estimated by modeling crop yields under climate change scenarios or with statistical analysis of the impacts of year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields. However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) also affect agricultural output and show sensitivity to climate variability and change. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency, and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses, and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts on agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.",

The company saw triple-digit growth in AI-related revenue in the fourth quarter.\nTo attract start-ups and small businesses that will support long-term growth, Alibaba recently slashed the price of over 100 core public cloud products in the Chinese market.\nIn April, the company also extended these cost reductions to international customers, with an average price reduction of 23%.\n\u201cWe are excited by the accelerated growth of customers and cloud computing revenues related to our AI products. We will remain focused on our strategic priorities and capture future growth opportunities,\u201d said Wu.\nOver 90,000 enterprises have adopted Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen large language model (LLM) since it debuted a year ago, on top of more than 7 million downloads on open-source platforms like Github.\nAlibaba Cloud recently launched a service to help companies customize and scale generative AI models, from consolidating multiple models to optimizing underlying infrastructure resources.\nIn addition, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI-driven sustainability platform Energy Expert rolled out an open API service enabling developers to build customized sustainability applications.\nIts AI computing platform for high-performance computing tasks, PAI-Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service, became available in Singapore for the first time this year.\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) marketplaces notched a 20% increase in combined orders for the latest quarter as revenue grew 45% year-over-year to RMB27.45 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nCross-border retail platform AliExpress provides price-competitive products and efficient fulfillment under its Choice service, which accounted for around 70% of AliExpress\u2019s total orders in April 2024.\nIncreased synergies between AliExpress and Cainiao led five to ten-day delivery completion rates to double year-over-year for Choice orders over the quarter.\nCainiao, which withdrew its plan to make an initial public offering on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange in March partly to focus on supporting cross-border fulfillment services within AIDC, has also gone from strength to strength.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue from Cainiao grew 30% year-over-year to RMB24.56 billion.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work.

Quarterly non-GAAP net income declined 11% year-over-year to RMB24.42 billion.\nAlibaba increased its capital expenditure on Alibaba Cloud infrastructure and its Chinese and cross-border e-commerce businesses, leading to double-digit growth across key metrics including gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that our strategies are working and we are returning to growth,\u201d said Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.\nThe company also announced a $4.0 billion dividend distribution to continuously enhance shareholder return.\nAlibaba\u2019s e-commerce businesses recorded an uptick in purchasing frequency and customer retention over the quarter, even as retail growth slowed in China.\nAcross the country, total retail sales of consumer goods in March grew 3.1% year-over-year, trailing the 5.5% and 7.4% growth recorded in the January-February and December periods, respectively, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.\nDespite the broader slowdown, revenue during the latest quarter grew 4% year-on-year to RMB93.22 billion at Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG).\nTTG\u2019s adjusted EBITA shrank slightly to RMB38.5 billion compared to RMB39.04 billion in the same quarter of 2023, as the business increased strategic investment in areas including customer service, membership program benefits and technology.\n\u201cOur China and international commerce businesses realized double-digit year-over-year GMV growth through our focus on the customer experience,\u201d said Wu, who stepped into the role of Taobao and Tmall Group CEO last year.\nHe has emphasized that 2024 would be a year of strategic upgrades and significant investment into the core businesses, and it has started to bear fruit.\nOnline gross merchandise value \u2013 excluding unpaid orders \u2013 and order growth expanded by double-digits year-over-year, fueling a 5% increase in customer management revenue.\nMembership in TTG\u2019s 88VIP loyalty program increased by double digits year-over-year in the quarter to top 35 million members, as consumers were enticed by improving service and more benefits.\nTaobao has introduced more user-friendly measures including a simplified 6.18 sales structure and a website update. Likewise, Tmall announced plans to triple the scale of resources dedicated to new products.\nBetween January and March, the number of new merchants on Tmall rose 60% year-over-year, while the total transaction volume of new merchants over this time increased by 150% compared with last year.\nQuarterly revenue from the company\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group rose 3% to RMB25.60 billion, driven by the double-digit growth of its public cloud business.\nAlibaba Cloud\u2019s public cloud offerings are available online for organizations and individuals alike, and include elastic compute, database and AI products and services. The company saw triple-digit growth in AI-related revenue in the fourth quarter.\nTo attract start-ups and small businesses that will support long-term growth, Alibaba recently slashed the price of over 100 core public cloud products in the Chinese market.\nIn April, the company also extended these cost reductions to international customers, with an average price reduction of 23%.\n\u201cWe are excited by the accelerated growth of customers and cloud computing revenues related to our AI products. We will remain focused on our strategic priorities and capture future growth opportunities,\u201d said Wu.\nOver 90,000 enterprises have adopted Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen large language model (LLM) since it debuted a year ago, on top of more than 7 million downloads on open-source platforms like Github.\nAlibaba Cloud recently launched a service to help companies customize and scale generative AI models, from consolidating multiple models to optimizing underlying infrastructure resources.\nIn addition, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI-driven sustainability platform Energy Expert rolled out an open API service enabling developers to build customized sustainability applications.\nIts AI computing platform for high-performance computing tasks, PAI-Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service, became available in Singapore for the first time this year.\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) marketplaces notched a 20% increase in combined orders for the latest quarter as revenue grew 45% year-over-year to RMB27.45 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nCross-border retail platform AliExpress provides price-competitive products and efficient fulfillment under its Choice service, which accounted for around 70% of AliExpress\u2019s total orders in April 2024.\nIncreased synergies between AliExpress and Cainiao led five to ten-day delivery completion rates to double year-over-year for Choice orders over the quarter.\nCainiao, which withdrew its plan to make an initial public offering on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange in March partly to focus on supporting cross-border fulfillment services within AIDC, has also gone from strength to strength.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue from Cainiao grew 30% year-over-year to RMB24.56 billion. Cainiao\u2019s five to ten-day delivery service extended into four additional countries during the quarter, bringing the number of countries covered by the premium service to 14.\nInvestment in cross-border initiatives ramped up across the board in the fourth quarter.\nTurkish online retailer Trendyol expanded into the Gulf region and has become one of the region\u2019s most downloaded e-commerce apps. At the same time, AliExpress earmarked millions of euros for discounts and deals as part of an exclusive global sponsorship of the upcoming UEFA European Football Championship set for this summer.\nAs a result of increased investment in key markets to enhance customer experience and expand consumer base, AIDC posted a loss of RMB4.09 billion in the quarter for adjusted EBITA.\nAs part of management\u2019s commitment to delivering value to shareholders, Alibaba has announced a two-part dividend worth an aggregate $4.0 billion.\nThe Alibaba board approved an annual regular cash dividend for the most recent fiscal year and an extraordinary cash dividend comprised of proceeds from the disposition of certain financial investments.\nThe one-time extraordinary dividend will come to $0.0825 per ordinary share or $0.66 per ADS and will be paid in U.S. dollars to holders of ordinary shares and ADSs as of the close of business on June 13, 2024, Hong Kong Time and New York Time, respectively.\n\u201cWe are committed to continuing to return value to our shareholders,\u201d said Alibaba\u2019s Xu.\nEarlier this year, the group said it would begin voluntary updates on its share repurchase program to increase transparency for investors.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Alibaba repurchased 1.25 billion ordinary shares for a total of $12.5 billion, including 524 million ordinary shares repurchased in its fourth fiscal quarter.\nAlibaba\u2019s total shareholder yield, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, led its large-cap peers by reaching 6.5% during the 2023 calendar year.\nThe holding company, which made its 2014 stock market debut in New York and completed a secondary listing in Hong Kong in 2019, is also in the midst of preparations for a dual-primary listing on the two bourses slated for the end of August 2024.",

Note: Public school enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students, but do not include students attending joint-vocational districts and educational service centers, pupils attending non-public schools, or home schooled students. More information about those enrollments are found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchool Options\u00e2\u0080\u009d section.\nPublic School Enrollment by Grade\u00a0Level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23).\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest race/ethnic student groups, white and African American students, has also declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23).

Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends by Selected Characteristics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, English learner enrollment has more than doubled, while the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The number of students identified as gifted has declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nLow Income Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe percentage of students identified as economically disadvantaged has increased since 2005-06. However, the percentage of Ohio children living in poverty has remained mostly static.\nSource: Economically disadvantaged data are from Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23); childhood poverty data are from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Kids Count Data Center and based on U.S. Census poverty estimates (data were not reported for 2020 and are not yet available for 2023). Notes: Ohio identifies students as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomically disadvantaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d via federal meal programs, open to pupils from households with incomes at or below 185% of federal poverty. However, in 2010, Congress passed the Community Eligibility Provision which allows certain schools to deem all students as disadvantaged (even higher-income children) for the purposes of meals eligibility. In contrast, children in poverty are from households at or below 100% federal poverty.\nOhio School Districts and Typologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor analytic purposes, the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce categorizes districts into eight typologies based on their geographic and socio-economic characteristics. This publication displays various statistics by typology to illustrate patterns of enrollment and achievement across the state.\nSource: Ohio DEW, School District Typology. Note: This map displays the border of each district and its corresponding typology.\nPublic School Students by Typology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas and 35 percent are from suburban communities; 21 percent live in small towns while 15 percent are from rural areas.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: Public charter and STEM schools are assigned to the typology of the district in which the school is located, as reported in DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community school directory. Online charters\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as e-schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094are not included in a typology, since they can enroll students statewide.\nPublic School Students in Urban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents living in urban areas come from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, and almost nine in ten are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23).

    "Document2": "UT Austin Enrolls Largest-Ever Student Body, Sets All-Time Highs for Graduation Rates\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 This fall, The University of Texas at Austin has admitted its largest-ever incoming class and enrolled more students than ever before. The university has 9,109 first-time, first-year undergraduates, according to data collected on the 12th class day of the current fall term, surpassing the record high from the previous year of 9,060. Total university enrollment rose to 52,384, surpassing the all-time high of 52,261 set in 2002.\u00a0\nThe increases, which followed another year of strong application numbers, were made possible in large part by the university\u2019s continued commitment to improving four- and six-year graduation rates, where UT Austin once again set all-time highs in both categories. The four-year rate rose to 73.5% this year, an increase of 21 percentage points since 2012, while the six-year rate rose to 87.8%, a gain of nine percentage points during the past decade.\u00a0\nGraduation rates at UT have shown consistent improvement since 2011, when the university set a goal of increasing the four-year graduation rate from 52% to 70%. Beginning in 2012-2013, the university implemented campus-wide student success programs and analyzed student data to provide proactive support for students to help them define and stick with a path toward graduation. The programs offer peer mentoring, academic support and scholarship access to help more incoming students succeed in college.\u00a0\n\u201cYear after year, increasingly more of the most outstanding students from across Texas and beyond want to enroll at our world-class university,\u201d said UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. \u201cImproved graduation rates reduce students\u2019 expenses and allow them to generate income sooner, while also expanding opportunities for incoming students who seek the rigorous education and vibrant college experience that UT offers.\u201d\u00a0\nThe university is also welcoming more first-generation and historically underrepresented groups than ever, while continuing to serve some of its highest numbers of students eligible for Pell grants, which are available to low-income families. Once in the classroom, these students are following the university\u2019s overall trends, performing at consistently higher levels relative to the university\u2019s historical norms. Four-year graduation rates for Black, Hispanic, first-generation and Pell-eligible students have increased, on average, by 27 percentage points since 2012, and each group has narrowed the gap with the university\u2019s overall graduation rate.\u00a0\nOverall, the university\u2019s number and percentage of historically underrepresented students \u2014 who identify as Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander \u2014 rose to their highest levels ever, now representing 33.6% of the undergraduate population and 30.3% of the university as a whole. At the undergraduate level alone, UT Austin will educate 13,872 historically underrepresented students in 2022, one of the largest totals of any state flagship university or member of the prestigious Association of American Universities.\u00a0\u00a0\nHispanic enrollment again reached all-time highs, further cementing the university\u2019s trajectory as one of the country\u2019s largest and most academically prestigious Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). The percentage of Hispanic undergraduates rose to 27.9% from 27.1% last year, and Hispanic students made up a plurality of 29.5% of first-year undergraduates this fall.\u00a0\nThe number of Black undergraduate students also increased, to 2,269 this fall from 2,219 last fall, with the number of Black students overall (graduate and undergraduate) increasing to 2,759 from 2,728.\u00a0\u00a0\nEnrollment of first-generation undergraduate students rose to 9,636 from 9,387 last year, representing 23.3% of all current undergraduates.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are committed to recruiting talented students with diverse backgrounds and experiences,\u201d said Hartzell. \u201cThe gains we have made are a testament to this effort, as well as our campaign pledge to raise $1 billion for scholarships and student support programs that will continue to expand opportunities for Longhorns from traditionally underserved communities.\u201d\u00a0\nNumbers for international students also rose, to 5,117 (9.8% of all students) this year from 4,725 (9.1% of all students) in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Preliminary as of 12th class day\u202f|\u202f** Black includes both \u201cBlack or African American alone\u201d and \u201cBlack or African American Multiracial (excluding Hispanic) | ***Reflects earliest verifiable data from 2014\u00a0\nNotable fall enrollment figures year over year, fall 2021 to fall 2022:\u00a0\nAll 2022 figures in this release are as of the 12th class day and therefore preliminary.

Fordham Institute presents the seventh edition of Ohio Education By The Numbers, offering a fact-based overview of K-12 education in Ohio. For more information, visit www.fordhaminstitute.org/ohio. Student Enrollment Ohio has 1.6 million public school students. Enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students but exclude joint-vocational districts, educational service centers, non-public schools, and homeschooled students. Public School Enrollment by Grade Level Ohio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level. Public School Enrollment Trends Since 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for white and African American students has also declined, while Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander student enrollment has increased. English learner enrollment has more than doubled, and the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The percentage of economically disadvantaged students has increased since 2005-06. Ohio School Districts and Typologies Ohio DEW categorizes districts into eight typologies based on geographic and socio-economic characteristics. 28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas, 35 percent in suburban communities, 21 percent in small towns, and 15 percent in rural areas. Public School Students in Urban Areas Almost nine in ten urban students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Suburban Areas About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Small Town Areas More than two in five small town students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Rural Areas Just under half of rural students are economically disadvantaged. Ohio\u2019s Twenty-Five Largest Districts by Enrollment (2022-23) Ohio Virtual Academy is considered equivalent to a school district. School Options Enrollment by Educational Model 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, over 110,000 attend charter schools, and more than 200,000 attend non-public schools or homeschool.

Today, most college and university students in the U.S. take at least some classes online.\nOnline degrees have a broad reach, encompassing new higher education concepts like microcredentials and massive open online courses (MOOCs), along with traditional college degrees.\nDistance learners, too, are a diverse group. As a remote student, your peers may include traditional college-age students, working parents, military service members, established professionals and lifelong learners.\nThis fast-growing field clearly holds wide appeal, but how big is online learning, exactly?\nThis article examines the popularity of online learning, charting how fast the field has grown in recent years and exploring the motivations behind distance learning. If you\u2019re a prospective or current online student, a parent or an educator\u2014or if you\u2019re just curious about the online learning phenomenon\u2014these are the key statistics to know.\nKey Takeaways\nOnline Learning by the Numbers\nAll types of colleges and universities offer classes online. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), public colleges enrolled about 8.5 million online students in 2021. Another 2.7 million remote learners attended private schools, including 1.9 million at nonprofit institutions and nearly 800,000 at for-profit schools.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the availability of online learning in higher education starting in 2020. NCES reports that 75% of all postsecondary students in the U.S.\u2014over 14 million learners\u2014took online classes in fall 2020 as the pandemic restricted in-person learning, whereas only 36% had enrolled in distance education in fall 2019.\nWith many schools opening classrooms for in-person learning again in 2021, the percentage of students enrolled in distance learning courses dropped to about 60%\u2014still much higher than in pre-pandemic years.\nOnline enrollment levels vary depending on where students live. Alaska, Hawai\u2019i and New Hampshire boast the highest percentages of online students in the United States.\nOnline Schools vs. Traditional College\nMany online degree seekers attend traditional schools, but as of 2020, about 15% of all U.S. college students attended primarily online institutions. NCES defines primarily online schools as those enrolling 90% or more of their student body in distance education. About 11% of U.S. colleges and universities\u2014422 institutions in total\u2014fit this profile.\nOften catering to working students, some online schools have always offered fully remote programs. Others began as traditional campus-based institutions, later establishing online divisions that grew to dwarf their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\nIn 2020, primarily online schools enrolled over 1.5 million full-time degree seekers. Another 1.2 million learners took classes part time. Female students outnumbered male students among both full-time and part-time enrollees, making up about 62% of all learners.\nOnline Learning Through the Years\nIn 2020, the onset of Covid-19 disrupted traditional education, abruptly forcing students, instructors and administrators to adapt to remote learning models.\nEven before the pandemic, however, remote learning had been growing steadily for almost a decade as daily life became more digitized and remote learning technology and infrastructure improved.\nIn 2012\u2014a watershed year in online education that saw the founding of MOOC giants edX and Coursera\u2014over 25% of U.S. college and university students took at least one distance learning course, NCES reports. By 2019, that number had risen to 36%, about half of whom attended exclusively online.\nIn 2020, the number of online students at traditional higher education institutions exploded as schools shifted courses online amid lockdown restrictions. During that year, about 46% of U.S. learners studied entirely online, and another 28% took at least some courses remotely. As of 2021, remote learning numbers remained high, with about 60% of college students taking some or all of their classes online.\nMany traditional degree-seeking students returned to in-person learning when schools reopened in 2021, but online education as a whole continued to grow.\nThe World Economic Forum reports that in 2016, Coursera had 21 million registered users. By 2019, 44 million learners used the MOOC platform. This number leaped to 71 million in 2020, but unlike online college enrollment numbers, Coursera\u2019s enrollment did not drop in 2021. Instead, the platform gained even more users, totaling 92 million in 2022.\nOnline Degrees\nRemote learning programs serve this growing body of online students with degree programs at all levels. NCES reports that in the 2019-20 academic year, primarily online colleges conferred:\nMale-identifying students earned 37% to 39% of these degrees, with female-identifying students earning 61% to 63%.\nStudents at primarily online schools make up 14.7% of all college and university enrollees. They earn:\nOnline doctoral programs are relatively uncommon; remote learners earn only 7.6% of all doctorates.\nOnline Learning by Race\nOnline schools serve a racially diverse student body, with more than half of all learners identifying as nonwhite. These institutions enroll minority learners at higher rates than conventional schools across most reported categories, as shown in the chart below.\nIlana Hamilton is a writer and editor specializing in education and career topics.

It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\nPerhaps the \"most encouraging\" news for consumers is that inflation for household necessities has cooled dramatically, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n\"The prices for staples \u00e2\u20ac\u201d food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they haven't changed in about a year,\" Zandi said. \"So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.\"\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n\"We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,\" Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week.\nHowever, additional improvements are likely to be \"slow-going,\" they wrote.\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their\u00c2\u00a0highest level\u00c2\u00a0in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation.\nLast month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024.\n\"All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,\" Zandi said.\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\nGasoline played a large role in June's inflation pullback.\nPrices fell 3.8% in June relative to May, according to CPI data. That follows a 3.6% decline the prior month.\n\"Tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs\" have led to weaker gas prices, AAA wrote in June.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why Fed policy may make your next trip abroad more expensiveInflation largely isn't Biden or Trump's fault, say economistsMore Americans are struggling even as inflation cools\nAverage U.S. pump prices fell to $3.48 a gallon as of July 1, down from $3.52 on June 3, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.\nGasoline prices are down 2.5% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store.\n\"Food at home\" prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nConsumers have more \"breathing room\" at the store amid \"growing promotional activity\" among retailers, while a few \"major\" companies recently announced price cuts \"that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,\" wrote economists House and George.\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends.\nThey also generally like to examine \"core\" inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThe monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.\n\"Core\" CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI.\nShelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said.\nThe shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it.\nHowever, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021.\n\"It should continue to cool off,\" said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n\"It just takes time,\" he added.\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment.\nIt is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment.\n\"The goods side looks very benign at the moment,\" said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. \"Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.\"\nFor example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a \"notable\" 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\nIt also takes a long time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a year, two or even three \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\nThe services sector is generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market such as strong wage growth.\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades. The labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though it remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n\"Inflationary pressure from the labor market has dissipated quite strongly,\" Cross said.\nDon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

REUTERS/Hollie Adams/File Photo\n(Reuters) - British consumer confidence held at an almost three-year high in August, bolstered by improving sentiment around personal finances and major purchases, according to a survey on Friday that added to positive signals in the wider economy.\nThe GfK Consumer Confidence Index, Britain's longest-running gauge of economic morale among members of the public, was steady in August at -13, matching July's 34-month high. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of -12.\nThe survey follows mostly positive data from companies since Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party won a landslide election victory last month. Business surveys put the economy on course for solid growth in the second half of 2024.\nThe survey's measure of enthusiasm for major purchases rose to its highest level since January 2022, while the outlook for personal finances also notched higher.\n\"This more positive outlook may be due to a mortgage-friendly interest rate cut at the beginning of August, and hopes of more to come,\" said Joe Staton, client strategy director at market research company GfK.\nThe BoE cut borrowing costs from a 16-year high of 5.25% earlier this month but Governor Andrew Bailey and other top officials have signalled they might not follow that up with rapid further reductions in rates.\nInvestors were assigning a less than 30% chance of a September rate cut on Thursday.\nA Reuters poll of economists published on Wednesday suggested the BoE will cut interest rates just once more this year, in November.\nThe GfK report's gauges of past and future economic sentiment cooled, however.\nThe survey of 2,003 people took place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 15.\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by David Milliken)\nCopyright 2024 Thomson Reuters.\nSponsored Bank Accounts\nTags: United Kingdom, Europe\nCredit Cards\nPersonal Loans \nMortgages\nBanking\n\n    Comparative assessments and other editorial opinions are those of U.S. News\n    and have not been previously reviewed, approved or endorsed by any other\n    entities, such as banks, credit card issuers or travel companies.

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n",

Contributing factors include growing healthcare costs, stricter payer reimbursement policies, and claims processing errors. Providers are seeing an uptick in nonpayment, plus an added burden on administrative staff, disrupted patient care, and hits to the bottom line.\nExperian Health surveyed over 200 healthcare professionals, primarily in executive or management roles, to better understand the current state of claims. The findings of the State of Claims 2024 report break down the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, reasons for denials, and providers\u2019 concerns about reimbursement.\nRising healthcare costs: who will foot the bill?\nThe U.S. healthcare system is the most expensive in the world, and costs continue to rise. In 2022, healthcare spending reached $4.5 trillion, a threefold increase from $1.4 trillion in 2000. In 2023, costs rose 7.5% to $4.8 trillion. Paying for healthcare is becoming more and more out of reach for patients and causing great concern. Over three-quarters (77%) of providers worry patients will skip out on their medical bills.\nPayer reimbursement challenges are also weighing heavily on healthcare leaders\u2019 minds. More than 75% are worried about nonpayment due to ever-evolving payer policy changes. They also have concerns about the pre-authorization struggles that have continued since 2022, as reported in the State of Claims 2022 survey. Hospitals are particularly feeling the financial pinch of operating within such an expensive environment and face uncertainties about meeting financial obligations on top of other major post-pandemic challenges like staff shortages.\nThe impact of claims denials\nProviders continue to see claims being denied in greater numbers. In 2022, 42% of respondents said denials are increasing. The number jumped to 77% in 2024. Similarly, the time it takes to be reimbursed is increasing, per 67% of respondents. That number was 51% in 2022.\nIn 2024, 84% of healthcare organizations\u00a0will make reducing denied claims a top priority. The Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy reports that the burden of denied claims totals around $260 billion\u00a0annually. The impact of claim denials is far-reaching, affecting the patient experience and revenue cycles. Struggles with claims also burden staff and drain resources, contributing to even more losses.\nThe growing challenge of data collection, verification and authorization\nSuccessful claims processing depends on accuracy. However, achieving accuracy in data collection, verification, and authorization processes remains a continued challenge for claims management teams. Nearly half of respondents (46%) in the State of Claims 2024 report identified missing or inaccurate information as the primary cause for denial. Inaccurate or missing data also creates extra steps in claims processing, resulting in the need for secondary checks and \u201cwasted\u201d healthcare dollars. Survey respondents reported using multiple solutions to collect all the necessary patient data for claims, with some using as many as four different products.\nLeveling the playing field in claims management with technology\nStaying on top of reimbursement requirements and processes is complex, resource-demanding and time-consuming. Inaccuracies commonplace with manual processing exacerbate issues and further extend processing and reimbursement times. However, automation and AI technology have proven effective at reducing claims denials and the burden of manual processing.\n\u201cAdding AI in claims processing cuts down denials significantly,\u201d Tom Bonner, Principal Product Manager at Experian Health, explains. AI automation quickly flags errors, allowing claims editing before payer submission. It\u2019s not science fiction\u2014AI is the tool hospitals need for better healthcare claims denial prevention and management.\u201d\nDuring the pandemic, providers embraced new technology to meet immediate needs; however, that momentum slowed in recent years. In 2022, survey data revealed that 62% of providers were using some form of automation and AI technology. Yet, in 2024, only 31% said they used\u00a0this type of technology.\nHere\u2019s how claims automation can help healthcare organizations improve claims success rates:\n\nManage the entire claims process: Using an automated, scalable claims management system, like ClaimSource\u00ae, helps reduce denials and increase revenue. Providers can manage their entire claims cycle in a single application and ensure claims are clean before submission.\nSubmit more accurate claims: An automated claims submission tool, like ClaimScrubber, helps identify errors that typically result in denials or underpayments before submission. This results in quicker payments, less time chasing aged accounts receivables, and improved cash flow.\nEliminate manual processes: Providers that use Denials Workflow Manager can target claims that need attention immediately, managing denials more effectively and increasing reimbursements significantly.\nImprove cash flow: Enhanced Claim Status helps providers take an early-and-often approach to monitoring claim status in the adjudication process. It eliminates manual follow-up tasks, allowing providers to respond early and accurately to pended, returned-to-provider, denied or zero-pay transactions.\nPrevent denials: Experian Health\u2019s AI Advantage\u2122, an AI-driven platform, uses an organization\u2019s own historical claims data, plus Experian Health\u2019s sophisticated knowledge of payer rules, to continuously learn and adapt to an ever-changing payer policy landscape. This technology helps providers better predict and prevent claims denials, focus on high-priority claims, and boost overall revenue.\n\nAdaptation of technology is likely on the rise with 45% of healthcare leaders planning to invest in automation in the next six months. Over the next year, these investments could pay off if claims denials start to decrease as a result, prompting more healthcare organizations to boost investments in claims management technology.\nDownload the State of Claims 2024 report to get the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, or contact us to learn how Experian Health can help with better claims management.\nGet the report Claims management solutions\n\nPrev\n\nRelated Posts\n\nWhat is revenue cycle management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nThis blog examines revenue cycle management (RCM) in healthcare process as a whole: what it is, how it works, and more.\nPublished: September 10, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nWhat is denial management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nDiscover the importance of healthcare denial management and get strategies to minimize claim denials and improve your financial performance.\nPublished: September 6, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nRevenue cycle management best practices: a guide f...\nFeatured \nDiscover revenue cycle management best practices healthcare leaders should follow to optimize workflows and promote financial stability.\nPublished: August 13, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\nSubscribe to our blog\nEnter your name and email for the latest updates.\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nTags\nai advantage ai advantage denial triage ai advantage predictive denials artificial intelligence automation claim denials claims Claim Scrubber claims management ClaimSource collections Collections Optimization Manager consumer data Coverage Discovery COVID-19 data Data and Analytics digital front door identity management Insurance Eligibility Verification online scheduling patient access patient access curator Patient Collections patient engagement patient estimates patient experience patient financial advisor patient financial clearance patient identity patient payment patient payment estimates patient portal patient registration patient satisfaction patient schedule patientsimple price transparency pymnts registration accelerator Revenue Cycle Management self-scheduling social determinants of health state of claims 2022 state of patient access\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nSubscribe\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\n\nLegal Terms & Conditions\nPrivacy Center\nU.S. Data Privacy Policy\nAd Choices\nPress\nCareers\nInvestor Relations\nContact Us\n\nEXPERIAN'S DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION Learn more how Experian is committed\nDATA PRIVACY Your privacy choices\n\u00a9 2024 Experian Information Solutions, Inc.

In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading.

    "Document2": "Health Spending\nHow much and why 2024 premiums are expected to grow in Affordable Care Act Marketplaces\nBy Jared Ortaliza,\u00a0Matthew McGough,\u00a0Meghan Salaga,\u00a0Krutika Amin Twitter, and\u00a0Cynthia Cox Twitter\nKFF\nAugust 4, 2023\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nHealth insurers submit rate filings annually to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans for the coming year. A relatively small share of the population is enrolled in these plans (compared to the number in employer plans), but these filings are generally more detailed and publicly available. These filings provide insight into what factors insurers expect will drive health costs for the coming year.\nFor 2024, across 320 insurers participating in the 50 states and DC, this analysis shows a median proposed premium increase of 6%. Based on a more detailed analysis of publicly available documents from 58 insurers, growth in health care prices stood out as a key factor driving costs in 2024. In addition to inflation, insurers also mention changes in pandemic-related costs and the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage, though the latter are having a small, if any, effect on premiums.\nMost proposed rate increases for 2024 ACA Marketplace plans fall between 2% and 10%, with a median increase of 6%\nAmong 320 ACA Marketplace participating insurers nationally, premium changes range from a drop of \u201315% to an increase of 100%, but most proposed premium changes for 2024 fall between about 2% and 10% (the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively). Of the 320 filings, 41 insurers proposed decreasing premiums. On the other end of the spectrum, 76 insurers requested premium increases greater than 10%. These filings are preliminary and may change during the rate review process. 2024 rates will be finalized in late summer. A table in the appendix shows proposed premium increases by state and insurer.\nThe rate increase for an insurer is a weighted average across all of its products within a state (i.e., bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans). These weighted average premium changes will differ from the percent change in the benchmark silver plan, which is the basis for federal subsidies. Most enrollees in this market receive a subsidy and are not expected to face these premium increases. However, premium increases could result in higher federal spending on subsidies.\nWhat\u2019s driving 2024 premium changes?\nThe chart above shows premium changes for 320 insurers across all 50 states and DC. For the subsequent sections, this analysis focuses on a subset of these rate filings (58 insurers across 11 states and DC) in more detail to understand the factors driving premium changes in 2024. These insurers and states were selected because they have earlier and more transparent (less redacted) public reporting of proposed rate justifications. For context, though, the 58 insurers reviewed in this section have somewhat higher proposed rate increases, with a median of 9%.\nHealth Spending\nHealth & Wellbeing\nInflation\nAs is the case in most years, medical trend \u2013 which includes growth in prices paid by insurers for medical services and medications, as well as growth in the utilization of health care \u2013 is a key driver of premium growth in 2024. Many insurers expect utilization to grow relative to 2022, but price growth is generally playing a larger role in medical trend than utilization is.\nOf the insurer rate filings reviewed in detail, and when an annualized trend was publicly available, the median medical trend was 8%, with most reporting trend in the 7-9% range.\n\u201cThe primary driver of the premium increase is the increases in the cost of healthcare.\u00a0 The increases are associated with increases in the \u201cunit\u201d cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or \u201cutilization\u201d, by members.\u201d \u2013 Anthem Health Plans, Kentucky\nWhile health sector prices typically outpace price growth in the rest of the economy, the last two years have been an exception. Recent medical price growth has been similar to past years, while growth in prices in the rest of the economy has grown at a faster than usual pace. As contracts between insurers and providers are typically negotiated for a year or more, medical inflation often lags that in the rest of the economy.\nLooking ahead to 2024, many insurers are expecting broader economic inflation to flow through to the health system and put upward pressure on premiums.\n\u201cSignificant inflation in the cost of goods and services in all sectors of the economy has had a profound impact on the cost of medical services, and BCBSRI expects to see substantial increases in provider unit costs for 2024.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island\n\u201cWe expect unit cost trends to be higher in 2023 and 2024 due to inflation, supply shortages and labor shortages. Inpatient hospital cost per day trends will be increasing as hospitals seek to recover from 2022 financial losses.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\n\u201cHealth insurance premiums must correspond with the cost of our members\u2019 medical care, which continues to rise at an unparalleled rate year after year and is projected to increase significantly in 2024. Rising medical costs are the primary driver of our proposed individual rates and increase requested premiums by 19.1%.\u201d \u2013 Highmark, New York\nIn addition to driving up prices paid by insurers to providers, inflation is also putting upward pressure on insurers\u2019 administrative costs, such as their own staffing costs.\n\u201cBlue Cross VT is increasing base administrative costs (see section 3.8.7), which has the effect of increasing the premiums by 0.1 percent for individuals and 0.3 percent for small groups. This modest increase reflects current and expected inflationary levels.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nCOVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency\nThis year, as they did in prior years, insurers acknowledge there is still uncertainty surrounding the future of the pandemic. With the end of the Public Health Emergency (PHE) this year, plans can now charge cost sharing for COVID-testing, which could have a downward effect on insurer costs and therefore a downward effect on premiums. Conversely, the COVID vaccine will be commercialized, meaning increased cost to insurers on a per-dose basis. The use of COVID-19 related prevention and treatment may diminish, though, if severe cases continue to be less common. On net, most insurers that publicly quantify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in their filings expect their pandemic-related costs to decrease in 2024, having a small downward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMVP is assuming a 10% reduction in Covid testing costs in the projection period due to a utilization decrease, resulting in the removal of $0.31 PMPM. We expect demand for testing to decrease once cost sharing is reinstituted.\u201d \u2013 MVP Health Care, VT\n\u201cCosts related to COVID-19 decreased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, and have reached a relatively consistent month-to-month level since March 2022. We expect 2023 and 2024 COVID related costs will continue at this lower level and possibly trend slightly downward as population immunity continues to grow.\u201d \u2013 Molina Healthcare of Washington\nThe pandemic had a significant downward effect on utilization of health care generally early on, particularly in 2020, but insurers are expecting a continued return to more normal levels going forward.\n\u201cWhile 2022 trends are lower than 2021, we expect utilization trends to moderate and return to pre-COVID-19 levels over 2023 and 2024.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\nFew insurers mention pent up demand for the non-COVID care that was missed in 2020, and most of those that do mention it say the level of use they are expecting in the remainder of 2023 and 2024 is consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Very few insurers expect pent up demand to drive up costs in 2024.\nUnwinding of Medicaid continuous enrollment\nOn April 1, 2023, states started unwinding the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, resulting in at least 3.8 million people being disenrolled from Medicaid as of August 1, 2023. As a result, some people who have been disenrolled and deemed no longer eligible for Medicaid may enroll in the ACA marketplaces, where they may be eligible for subsidies.\nAbout half of the insurer rate filings reviewed do not mention Medicaid disenrollments in their 2024 premium filings. Those that mention the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage often say the impact on costs is difficult to predict, so they are not adjusting premiums. Several insurers say there will be an increase in their ACA enrollment, but no effect on market morbidity (i.e., the average health of enrollees), meaning no net impact on premiums.\n\u201cOur assumption is that the new members formerly in Medicaid will select a Blue Cross VT plan comparable to the current market share, about 60 percent, resulting in the Blue Cross VT individual market growing by 1,609 members and the Blue Cross VT small group market growing by 1,711 members. We further project that the new Medicaid members will have the same risk score relationship between the carriers as the existing market; therefore, the risk score impact is 1.000 for both carriers.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nA relatively small number of insurers expect the Medicaid unwinding to lead to a sicker group of people signing up for ACA plans, which would then have an upward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMedicaid redetermination and an otherwise shrinking market would lead to an increase in market average morbidity as relatively sicker members will enter and healthier members will leave the market.\u201d \u2013 BridgeSpan Health Company of Oregon\nOther Potential Drivers of Costs\nSome other factors that insurers mentioned in their 2024 rate filings, though much less commonly than the factors described above include:\nDiabetes and Weight Loss Drugs. Diabetic drugs, such as Semaglutide, are increasingly being utilized for weight loss. Given the increasing cost and use of Semaglutide and related drugs, a handful of insurers mention these drugs as having an upward effect on their pharmaceutical spending.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA extends pandemic-era enhanced subsidies through 2025, bringing down premium costs for most consumers in this market. Few insurers mentioned the impact of the IRA subsidies on premiums as there has been no change in the amount of the subsidy from last year.\nOther federal policy changes do not appear to be driving premiums. Among insurer filings reviewed, only one mentioned the impact of new restrictions on surprise billing but reported that no adjustment was made for it.\u00a0 None of the insurers reviewed mentioned the impact of the administrative fix to the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d in their filings.\nDiscussion\nSimilar to last year, it appears that 2024 rates may rise moderately. The median proposed rate increase is 6% nationally, with most proposed increases falling between 2% and 10%. Most enrollees in this market are subsidized and do not pay the full premium. However, premium increases can affect federal spending and the driving factors behind these increases illustrate broader trends driving health costs in 2024.\nA key driver of the increase in premiums in 2024 appears to be rising health prices. While prices for health services tend to grow every year, it also appears that inflation in the rest of the economy may now be starting to flow into the health sector. Rising prices and utilization are not necessarily specific to the ACA individual market. Similar levels of medical trend were observed in small group market filings as well.\nMany insurers that publicly quantified the impacts of the pandemic are projecting a decrease in COVID-19 related costs in 2024. There are multiple factors considered when evaluating the total impact of COVID-19 on costs. Some insurers mentioned higher costs associated with vaccine costs shifting to insurers. Resumed member cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, however, may have a downward effect on premiums as members seek out these services less due to their cost.\nRelative to inflation and the pandemic, fewer insurers mentioned the impact of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, and there was variation in how insurers project its impact on costs. A very small number of insurers mentioned the upward effects of diabetic therapy and weight loss drugs on pharmaceutical trends, mostly pointing to increasing costs and utilization of said drugs. Federal policy changes, like the administrative fix to the Family Glitch and the No Surprises Act, were rarely mentioned by insurers, if at all, despite their potential impacts on enrollment and costs.\nMethods\nProposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov for 320 insurers across 50 states and Washington, DC. Additionally, 58 insurer actuarial memoranda were collected from state rate review websites and were comprehensively reviewed to understand the factors contributing to rate changes. These 58 insurers were from the following Marketplaces: District of Columbia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Insurer actuarial memoranda were systematically evaluated for key words related to, but not limited to, medical trend, COVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency, Medicaid redeterminations, Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, family glitch, surprise billing, telehealth, price transparency, and diabetes or weight loss drugs. Recorded medical trend values reported here are annualized.\nAppendix\nThe Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF\u00a0are partnering to monitor how well the U.S. healthcare system is performing in terms of quality and cost.\nLooking for more data?\nFind out more details about U.S. healthcare from our updated dashboard.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\n\u00a9 2024 PETERSON-KFF Health System Tracker \u00a0 All Rights Reserved",

For 2024, 320 insurers across 50 states and DC propose a median premium increase of 6%. The proposed changes range from a decrease of 15% to an increase of 100%, with most falling between 2% and 10%. These filings are preliminary and subject to change during the rate review process, with final rates expected in late summer.Key drivers of the 2024 premium changes include:1. **Health Spending and Inflation**: Medical trend, which includes growth in prices for medical services and medications, is a significant factor. The median medical trend is 8%, with most insurers reporting trends between 7-9%. Broader economic inflation is also expected to impact health system costs.2. **COVID-19 and the End of the Public Health Emergency**: Insurers expect a decrease in pandemic-related costs in 2024. The end of the Public Health Emergency allows plans to charge cost-sharing for COVID-testing, potentially reducing insurer costs. However, the commercialization of the COVID vaccine may increase costs.3. **Unwinding of Medicaid Continuous Enrollment**: As of August 1, 2023, at least 3.8 million people have been disenrolled from Medicaid. Some may enroll in ACA marketplaces, but the impact on premiums is uncertain. Some insurers expect no significant effect, while a few anticipate an increase in market morbidity.4. **Other Factors**: A few insurers mention the impact of diabetes and weight loss drugs, such as Semaglutide, on pharmaceutical spending. Federal policy changes like the Inflation Reduction Act and the No Surprises Act were rarely mentioned.The analysis includes data from 58 insurers across 11 states and DC, with a median proposed rate increase of 9%. The findings suggest that rising health prices and broader economic inflation are primary drivers of premium increases for 2024. The impact of the pandemic is expected to decrease, while the effects of Medicaid disenrollment and other factors vary among insurers.Methods: Proposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov and state rate review websites. Insurer actuarial memoranda were reviewed for key factors contributing to rate changes, including medical trend, COVID-19, Medicaid redeterminations, and other relevant topics.",

Where does everyone else land?\nShare this story\n\nShare\nAll sharing options for:\nReport card: grading each member of the Celtics through 55 games\n\nThe All-Star break is an ideal time to take a step back, catch our collective breath and analyze what we\u2019ve seen to this point.\nIt\u2019s also a fun time to dish out some grades. The Celtics are 43-12, so naturally most of these grades are going to be favorable, but the minuses and pluses are sure to spark some debate. Here we go:\nJayson Tatum: A\nTatum is the best player on the best team. Forget the Most Valuable Player talk for a second. He probably won\u2019t win it, and that\u2019s OK; he\u2019s the head of the snake and has reached a new level as a leader this year with Marcus Smart gone. \nHe\u2019s taking even more accountability defensively, minimizing poor shooting nights and complaining about calls a little less (I said a little). If he\u2019s not careful, he might become the face of the league in June.\nJayson Tatum is confident he's the NBA's top player   pic.twitter.com/UBL5SyCaZu\nJaylen Brown: B+\nBrown has had some moments of brilliance and some head-scratchers along the way. He\u2019s capable of dropping 30-plus any night, but he\u2019s also capable of dropping 10 or fewer. The most important thing for him (now that he appears to possess a left hand) is consistency. \nHe\u2019s shooting a career-high 49.2 percent from the floor, but just 34.2 percent from 3-point range. His defense and passing have improved, but he\u2019s averaging his fewest rebounds (5.5) since 2018-19. When Brown is elite, the Celtics are essentially unbeatable.\nKristaps Porzingis: A\nIt\u2019s hard to remember a situation since Kevin Garnett where a player adjusted so seamlessly and immediately felt like the missing piece. Porzingis has been insanely efficient on post-ups, excelling in an area the Celtics dramatically needed him to.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively and is more capable of guarding shorter players than I realized. The only small critiques are that he should shoot a smidgen more 2s and a smidgen fewer 3s. I mean, the guy\u2019s 7\u20192 with the touch of an angel.\nMost points per possession on post-ups this season (min. 75 FGA): 1.42 - Kristaps Porzingis 1.17 - Joel Embiid 1.17 - Myles Turner 1.16 - Jayson Tatum1.15 - Jonas Valanciunas 1.14 - Nikola Jokic 1.12 - Anthony Davis 1.11 - Karl-Anthony TownsKP in a league of his own   pic.twitter.com/I58XI7K17E\nJrue Holiday: A-\nHoliday\u2019s 3-point shooting has exceeded expectations (career-high 44 percent), and he sets the tone defensively every night. He always finds clever ways to contribute, whether he takes 20 shots or five. \nHis maturity, consistency and poise set him apart. One area I\u2019d like to see a bit more is playmaking. He\u2019s averaging 4.8 assists \u2013 his lowest since 2011-12 \u2013 and I believe that number could be around 6. Obviously part of it is circumstantial, but I think putting the ball in his hands at the top of the key a bit more could be beneficial.\nDerrick White: A\nDon\u2019t worry, White gets an A. I\u2019m sure my colleagues would blast me if he didn\u2019t, but he truthfully does deserve one. He has career-highs in points (15.6), rebounds (3.9), blocks (1.2) and steals (1) and consistently plays his best in the fourth quarter.\nWhite is the consummate professional and has become a fan favorite. He can do no wrong in Celtics\u2019 fans eyes. Folks appreciate guys who hustle, make winning plays and exude charisma, and White embodies all those characteristics and then some.\nAl Horford: B+\nHorford is always ready, whether the Celtics need him to play 30 minutes or 15. At the moment, he gets a B+, but this grade is less relevant than some others. It\u2019s all about preserving him for the playoffs, and he\u2019s fully capable of upping his grade to an A then \u2013 particularly if Boston plays Philly.\nOne area Horford has really excelled this year is rebounding (6.7 a night). His 3-point shooting has naturally dipped a bit from last year, but it\u2019s still at 40.9 percent. I still want to see him attack the basket a bit more, but it\u2019s possible that\u2019s just not in his wheelhouse at this point.\nPayton Pritchard: A-\nThe Celtics were right to pay Pritchard, and overall, he\u2019s thrived in his expanded role. He\u2019s 15th in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio (4.81) and has excelled as a ball-handler and facilitator. \nHe\u2019s always locked in, whether he plays in the fourth quarter of a close game or garbage time (don\u2019t tell him it\u2019s garbage time). Pritchard fits in perfectly with this core.\nPayton Pritchard stats at the All-Star break:20.7 MPG8.1 PPG3.2 RPG2.8 APG44% FG38% 3FGHow are we feeling about the season so far @paytonpritch3?? pic.twitter.com/BC3DTIIaJo\nSam Hauser: A-\nHauser\u2019s shooting 41.2 percent from 3, which is great, but it\u2019s really his spacing that sets him apart. When Tatum, Brown and Porzingis have the ball, you really can\u2019t double. If you do, they\u2019ll find Hauser open for 3. He\u2019s solid with the bench unit, but he\u2019s even more lethal with the starters.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively, and his mid-range jumper\u2019s improved as well. It\u2019s easy to forget this is just his second season logging regular minutes.\nLuke Kornet: B+\nKornet\u2019s averages of 4.9 points and 4 rebounds aren\u2019t earth-shattering, but they\u2019re pretty solid when you consider that he plays 14.9 minutes per game. He\u2019s sneaky good in the pick-and-roll, an absolute goofball and excellent for team vibes. Rim protection is an area where he could improve.\nOshae Brissett: B\nIf Brissett can get that 3-point percentage up just a tick, from 29.3 to 33.3 or so, that would go a long way. He\u2019s long, athletic and has a good motor, but his shot makes him a bit of a liability at the moment.\nNeemias Queta: B+\nQueta is the definition of a \u201cfun project.\u201d You can sometimes see the lightbulb go off mid-game, which is pretty cool, and he\u2019s only getting better. The next steps are post moves, lateral quickness and defending without fouling.\n\n    More From\n    \n        CelticsBlog\n\n\n\n\n\n          Most Read\n        \n\n\n\nSign up for the\n          \n            newsletter\n          \n          Sign up for the Celtics Blog Daily Roundup newsletter!\n        \nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\nOops.

    "Document2": "Trail Blazers suffer 3rd worst loss in history at Miami Heat\nPatty Mills #88 of the Miami Heat shoots the ball against the Portland Trailblazers during the first half at the Kaseya Center on March 29, 2024 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Lauren Sopourn/Getty Images)Getty Images\nDeandre Ayton and Matisse Thubulle returned to the rotation for the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night and were greeted rather rudely by the Miami Heat.\nThe Heat led 29-19 after the first quarter then went off for 45 points in the second quarter to lead 74-30 at halftime. The Blazers never remotely got back into the game and fell 142-82, the third most lopsided defeat in franchise history.\n\u201cIt was just a rough one,\u201d Blazers coach Chauncey Billups told reporters. \u201cIt was just a rough one for everybody.\u201d\nNot quite everybody. Ayton, who missed four games with elbow tendinitis, did all he could during a dreadful first half by scoring 16 points on 8-of-13 shooting.\n\u201cWe were happy to have him,\u201d Billups said. \u201cDA was his normal efficient self. He was very efficient and he was good on the glass. I\u2019m pretty sure he felt good just kind of getting back out there after being down for a while. I thought he did the best that he could.\u201d\nThe rest of the Blazers shot 10 of 32 (31.3%) from the field in the first half and 1 of 14 from three-point range while committing 10 turnovers.\nFor the game, the Blazers shot 39.8% from the field and 5 on 31 threes (16.1%). The Blazers committed 24 turnovers on the night.\nBillups briefly discussed how the Blazers started off playing clean basketball. They led 11-10 about four minutes into the game.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt happened pretty quick where we couldn\u2019t score. We couldn\u2019t get in the paint. We try to make a point, always, of getting the ball to the paint. Collapsing defenses and then create the chase, is what I call it.\u201d\nInstead, Miami prevented the Blazers from accomplishing their goal.\n\u201cTheir defense, they got physical,\u201d Billups said. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t get to the paint. And we just kind of settled, settled, settled. We turned it over. And we had a lot of what I call \u2018shooting turnovers,\u2019 which are just horrible shots that might as well be a turnover. And everything just kind of went bad at the same time.\u201d\nAyton, who played just over five minutes in the second half, finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 20 points with six assists but also committed seven turnovers.\nDalano Banton, who set a career high with 31 points during Wednesday\u2019s loss at Atlanta, shot just 5 of 19 against the Heat for 12 points.\nThe Heat did whatever they wanted on offense, shooting 59.3% from the field and 21 of 39 on threes (53.8%).\nThe Heat had six players with double-digit scoring, four over 20. Thomas Bryant led the Heat with 26 points off the bench. Terry Rozier scored 22 with six assists.\nWHAT IT MEANS\nThe Blazers (19-55) lost their ninth consecutive game to match their longest losing streak of the season. The Heat (40-33) remained in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, slightly ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (39-35).\nMONUMENTAL LOSS\nThe 60-point defeat is the third-worst in franchise history. Earlier this season, Portland lost 139-77 at Oklahoma City. That 62-point defeat ranks second all-time. The Blazers\u2019 worst loss in franchise history came Feb. 27, 1998, at Indiana by the score of 124-59 (65 points).\nMATISSE THYBULLE\nThe Blazers guard returned to action but didn\u2019t last long. Thybulle played seven minutes before leaving the game with a right ankle impingement. He had missed five games with an ankle injury leading up to Friday night.\nNEXT UP\nThe Blazers play at 4 p.m. Monday at the Orlando Magic.\nLatest Blazers news\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)\nMORE BLAZERS COVERAGE\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Where does everyone else land?\nShare this story\n\nShare\nAll sharing options for:\nReport card: grading each member of the Celtics through 55 games\n\nThe All-Star break is an ideal time to take a step back, catch our collective breath and analyze what we\u2019ve seen to this point.\nIt\u2019s also a fun time to dish out some grades. The Celtics are 43-12, so naturally most of these grades are going to be favorable, but the minuses and pluses are sure to spark some debate. Here we go:\nJayson Tatum: A\nTatum is the best player on the best team. Forget the Most Valuable Player talk for a second. He probably won\u2019t win it, and that\u2019s OK; he\u2019s the head of the snake and has reached a new level as a leader this year with Marcus Smart gone. \nHe\u2019s taking even more accountability defensively, minimizing poor shooting nights and complaining about calls a little less (I said a little). If he\u2019s not careful, he might become the face of the league in June.\nJayson Tatum is confident he's the NBA's top player   pic.twitter.com/UBL5SyCaZu\nJaylen Brown: B+\nBrown has had some moments of brilliance and some head-scratchers along the way. He\u2019s capable of dropping 30-plus any night, but he\u2019s also capable of dropping 10 or fewer. The most important thing for him (now that he appears to possess a left hand) is consistency. \nHe\u2019s shooting a career-high 49.2 percent from the floor, but just 34.2 percent from 3-point range. His defense and passing have improved, but he\u2019s averaging his fewest rebounds (5.5) since 2018-19. When Brown is elite, the Celtics are essentially unbeatable.\nKristaps Porzingis: A\nIt\u2019s hard to remember a situation since Kevin Garnett where a player adjusted so seamlessly and immediately felt like the missing piece. Porzingis has been insanely efficient on post-ups, excelling in an area the Celtics dramatically needed him to.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively and is more capable of guarding shorter players than I realized. The only small critiques are that he should shoot a smidgen more 2s and a smidgen fewer 3s. I mean, the guy\u2019s 7\u20192 with the touch of an angel.\nMost points per possession on post-ups this season (min. 75 FGA): 1.42 - Kristaps Porzingis 1.17 - Joel Embiid 1.17 - Myles Turner 1.16 - Jayson Tatum1.15 - Jonas Valanciunas 1.14 - Nikola Jokic 1.12 - Anthony Davis 1.11 - Karl-Anthony TownsKP in a league of his own   pic.twitter.com/I58XI7K17E\nJrue Holiday: A-\nHoliday\u2019s 3-point shooting has exceeded expectations (career-high 44 percent), and he sets the tone defensively every night. He always finds clever ways to contribute, whether he takes 20 shots or five. \nHis maturity, consistency and poise set him apart. One area I\u2019d like to see a bit more is playmaking. He\u2019s averaging 4.8 assists \u2013 his lowest since 2011-12 \u2013 and I believe that number could be around 6. Obviously part of it is circumstantial, but I think putting the ball in his hands at the top of the key a bit more could be beneficial.\nDerrick White: A\nDon\u2019t worry, White gets an A. I\u2019m sure my colleagues would blast me if he didn\u2019t, but he truthfully does deserve one. He has career-highs in points (15.6), rebounds (3.9), blocks (1.2) and steals (1) and consistently plays his best in the fourth quarter.\nWhite is the consummate professional and has become a fan favorite. He can do no wrong in Celtics\u2019 fans eyes. Folks appreciate guys who hustle, make winning plays and exude charisma, and White embodies all those characteristics and then some.\nAl Horford: B+\nHorford is always ready, whether the Celtics need him to play 30 minutes or 15. At the moment, he gets a B+, but this grade is less relevant than some others. It\u2019s all about preserving him for the playoffs, and he\u2019s fully capable of upping his grade to an A then \u2013 particularly if Boston plays Philly.\nOne area Horford has really excelled this year is rebounding (6.7 a night). His 3-point shooting has naturally dipped a bit from last year, but it\u2019s still at 40.9 percent. I still want to see him attack the basket a bit more, but it\u2019s possible that\u2019s just not in his wheelhouse at this point.\nPayton Pritchard: A-\nThe Celtics were right to pay Pritchard, and overall, he\u2019s thrived in his expanded role. He\u2019s 15th in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio (4.81) and has excelled as a ball-handler and facilitator. \nHe\u2019s always locked in, whether he plays in the fourth quarter of a close game or garbage time (don\u2019t tell him it\u2019s garbage time). Pritchard fits in perfectly with this core.\nPayton Pritchard stats at the All-Star break:20.7 MPG8.1 PPG3.2 RPG2.8 APG44% FG38% 3FGHow are we feeling about the season so far @paytonpritch3?? pic.twitter.com/BC3DTIIaJo\nSam Hauser: A-\nHauser\u2019s shooting 41.2 percent from 3, which is great, but it\u2019s really his spacing that sets him apart. When Tatum, Brown and Porzingis have the ball, you really can\u2019t double. If you do, they\u2019ll find Hauser open for 3. He\u2019s solid with the bench unit, but he\u2019s even more lethal with the starters.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively, and his mid-range jumper\u2019s improved as well. It\u2019s easy to forget this is just his second season logging regular minutes.\nLuke Kornet: B+\nKornet\u2019s averages of 4.9 points and 4 rebounds aren\u2019t earth-shattering, but they\u2019re pretty solid when you consider that he plays 14.9 minutes per game. He\u2019s sneaky good in the pick-and-roll, an absolute goofball and excellent for team vibes. Rim protection is an area where he could improve.\nOshae Brissett: B\nIf Brissett can get that 3-point percentage up just a tick, from 29.3 to 33.3 or so, that would go a long way. He\u2019s long, athletic and has a good motor, but his shot makes him a bit of a liability at the moment.\nNeemias Queta: B+\nQueta is the definition of a \u201cfun project.\u201d You can sometimes see the lightbulb go off mid-game, which is pretty cool, and he\u2019s only getting better. The next steps are post moves, lateral quickness and defending without fouling.\n\n    More From\n    \n        CelticsBlog\n\n\n\n\n\n          Most Read\n        \n\n\n\nSign up for the\n          \n            newsletter\n          \n          Sign up for the Celtics Blog Daily Roundup newsletter!\n        \nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\nOops.

The report offers market size and values in (USD Billion) during the forecasted years for the above segments.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Analysis\nThe Beauty and Personal Care Products Market size is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 4.64% over the next five years.\nMillennials are increasingly using beauty products like color cosmetics as part of their regular grooming routines. For instance, as of 2021, according to financial comparison service provider Mozo, the average Australian woman spent approximately USD 3,600 on beauty and personal care products yearly. The simple accessibility of these cosmetic items through various sales channels, with the increased emphasis on personal grooming, aided the sales value. Furthermore, the emergence of cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic components helped the market expansion. With the rising awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products, consumers are inclined toward organic personal care products. It is expected to drive market growth during the study period. Besides this, companies are capitalizing on consumers' demands to expand their share and consumer base in the market. For instance, in February 2022, a United Kingdom-based fashion company, Boohoo, launched a vegan beauty range of more than 50 products. Boohoo Beauty's cosmetics line includes highlighter sticks, blush, setting sprays, cosmetic palettes, and others available exclusively.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends\nInclination toward Natural/Organic Formulations\nThe growing concerns regarding the side effects of chemicals in personal care products, leading to skin irritation, allergies, and dullness, fueled the demand for natural and organic skincare products. Prolonged use of synthetic cosmetics may cause various health issues, such as irritation, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity. However, cosmetic products made of organic ingredients, such as plant extracts and natural oils, do not harm the skin. Natural skincare and cosmetic products that are free from chemicals and transparent about the content are preferred by consumers. This factor resulted in a shift in preference from synthetic skincare products to organic products among consumers.\nTo capitalize on this growing interest, manufacturers are revamping and expanding their product offerings by introducing a wide range of organic skincare products. These products contain plant-based, clean-label ingredients with organic, vegan, natural, chemical-free, and cruelty-free claims. For instance, in April 2022, Shiseido revealed a new skincare brand, Ul\u00e9. It sources pesticide-free botanicals from local vertical farms. The dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits of natural skincare led consumers to seek eco-friendly, sustainable, natural skincare products that offer greater product ingredient transparency. Furthermore, the growing trend of organic concepts through online stores for bio-cosmetic products is expected to boost the growth of the natural and organic beauty and personal care products market.\nAsia-Pacific Emerges as the Fastest-growing Region\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries like China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam present considerable growth opportunities for the market players. It is primarily due to the growing demand for color cosmetics, as many people unleash the potential of cosmetics in their daily makeup routine. Hence, the significant players are intensely embarking on product innovation and mergers and acquisitions as their prime strategy to consolidate the market. For instance, in April 2023, Personal care and beauty brand The Body Shop launched its 'activist' product range in the Indian market. The new line strengthens the brand's sustainable commitment in the country with a selection of skin products and color cosmetics.\nFurthermore, growing awareness regarding cosmetics products, such as facial makeup, hairstyling, and coloring products, with increasing demand for clean labels and natural ingredients, is expected to drive the market shortly. The need for multifunctional products is driving innovation as price-conscious consumers are opting for products that provide hydration and skin protection. The trend of social media influencers showcasing their beauty regimens increased over the past few years. Thus, both local and international beauty companies are turning to influencers to increase their brand awareness and reach potential consumers. For instance, in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, the Honest Company, a clean lifestyle company founded by Jessica Alba, launched its business in China. To capitalize on the relatively small but rising demand for sanitary beauty products, the digitally native company created a flagship store on Tmall Global, Alibaba Group's cross-border e-commerce platform. Chinese shoppers can purchase skin care and color cosmetics from Honest's brand, Honest Beauty. Shoppers on Tmall Global can select from various stock-keeping units, including its Extreme Length Mascara + Lash Primer and Hydrogel Cream, a face cream enriched with hyaluronic acid.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Industry Overview\nThe global beauty and personal care market is highly competitive, with a strong presence of regional and international players in the market like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. Demand is mainly driven by more adaptation toward skincare routines and consumer awareness about brand know-how. The companies improved the quality and product innovation regarding ingredients, functionality, and packaging. The key players are embarking on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation as their key strategies to achieve consolidation and optimize offerings. Moreover, these players merge with local players to gain dominance in the local market.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Leaders\nThe Procter & Gamble Company\nL'Oreal SA\nUnilever PLC\nColgate-Palmolive Company\nThe Estee Lauder Companies\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market News\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. For the full year, net revenues grew 6% to $45.8 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 12%, driven by 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. For both the quarter and the full year, organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across all operating segments.\n- Operating margin:\u00a0For the quarter, operating margin was 21.0% versus 20.5% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 23.1% versus 22.7% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin was 24.7% versus 25.4% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 29.1% versus 28.7% in the prior year. Operating margin performance included items impacting comparability and currency headwinds. For both the quarter and full year, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds.\n- Earnings per share:\u00a0For the quarter, EPS declined 2% to $0.46, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 10% to $0.49. EPS performance included the impact of a 14-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 13-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS grew 13% to $2.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 8% to $2.69. EPS performance included the impact of an 8-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 7-point currency headwind.\n- Market share:\u00a0For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.\n- Cash flow:\u00a0Cash flow from operations was $11.6 billion for the full year, an increase of $581 million versus the prior year, driven by strong business performance and working capital initiatives, partially offset by a transition tax payment and currency headwinds. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.7 billion for the full year, an increase of $213 million versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Connecting with consumers through experiences and digital engagement: The company continues to leverage its marketing transformation to build globally scaled marketing platforms tailored to local consumers. In the fourth quarter, \u201cThe World Needs More Santas\u201d campaign was executed in over 80 markets, continuing the company\u2019s rich history of celebrating the holidays. The company leveraged the success of its first AI-based platform, \u201cCreate Real Magic\u201d, by inviting consumers to create sharable, digital greeting cards featuring iconic brand assets such as cherished depictions of Santa Claus and the Coca\u2011Cola polar bear. Local initiatives generated buzz and excitement, such as the Coca\u2011Cola Caravan Truck Tour, which travelled throughout nearly 60 countries around the world making over a thousand stops and meeting over 16 million consumers to share in the magic. In total, the holiday campaign experiences garnered approximately 9 billion impressions on social media. By combining the company\u2019s global scale with local relevancy, the holiday activation contributed to Trademark Coca\u2011Cola\u00ae volume and value share gains as well as unit case volume and transactions growth for both the quarter and for the full year.\n-\u00a0Building a system that is increasingly positioned for sustainable long-term growth: Since the start of 2023, the company completed the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations in Vietnam to a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Limited (Swire), completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Pakistan to Coca\u2011Cola \u0130\u00e7ecek and completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Indonesia to Coca\u2011Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). More recently, the company completed the refranchising of a portion of its company-owned bottling operations in India to existing franchise bottlers and received regulatory approval to sell its bottling operations in the Philippines to CCEP and Aboitiz Equity Ventures, which is expected to close towards the end of February 2024. Additionally, the company recently completed the sale of its stake in the largest bottler in Thailand to Swire and existing shareholders of the bottler. Our franchise business model has enabled the company to develop a strong global footprint with a local touch in markets around the world. The company continuously works to optimize the system with trusted, capable and motivated bottling partners allowing it to focus on building and growing consumer-loved brands.\n-\u00a0Delivering on our purpose by empowering people to drive growth: The company\u2019s strategy is centered around people, starting with the employees who are critical in bringing this strategy to life. In November, the company was ranked #1 on the 2023 American Opportunity Index, which assessed how effectively companies enable employees to progress in their careers in the United States. Around the world, the company provides thousands of jobs and is invested in the long-term success of its employees.

Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 66% for the quarter, driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth, partially offset by higher operating costs.\n-\u00a0Reinvesting in the business: The company continued to invest in its various lines of business and spent\n$1.9 billion on capital expenditures in 2023, an increase of 25% versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Continuing to grow the dividend: The company paid dividends totaling $8.0 billion during 2023. The company has increased its dividend in each of the last 61 years.\n-\u00a0M&A initiatives: In 2023, the company did not make any significant acquisitions. The company continues to evaluate inorganic growth opportunities through brands and capabilities. In 2023, with respect to divestitures, the company made progress towards refranchising company-owned bottling operations.\n-\u00a0Share repurchases: In 2023, the company issued $0.5 billion of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchased $2.3 billion of shares. Consequently, net share repurchases (non-GAAP) were $1.7 billion. The company\u2019s remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $6 billion.\nOutlook\nThe 2024 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2024 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2024 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2024 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2024; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2024; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s full-year 2024 reported financial results.\nThe company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 6% to 7%.\nFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company\u2019s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.2%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail.\nGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 10% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 4% to 5%, versus $2.69 in 2023.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 4% to 5% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include an approximate 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe first quarter has one less day compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nNotes\n- All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.\n- All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales in the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. \u201cUnit case\u201d means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. \u201cUnit case volume\u201d means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.\n- \u201cConcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\n- \u201cPrice/mix\u201d represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.\n- First quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2022, and fourth quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2022. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.\nConference Call\nThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2023 operating results today, Feb. 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company\u2019s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The Beauty and Personal Care Products Market is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 4.64%. The market is driven by millennials' increasing use of beauty products and the accessibility of these products through various sales channels. The demand for natural, non-toxic, and organic components is rising due to awareness of the harmful effects of chemicals. Companies are expanding their product offerings to include organic skincare products. For instance, Boohoo launched a vegan beauty range in February 2022. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam, is the fastest-growing market due to the increasing demand for color cosmetics and the influence of social media. Major players in the market include Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. The market is segmented by product type, distribution channel, category, and geography. Seasonal trends between May 2024 and September 2024 affected Unilever's demand forecasts for personal care products, with increased demand during summer months due to higher usage of skincare and grooming products. The market is highly competitive, with companies focusing on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation to maintain their market position.",

(NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the second quarter 2024. \u201cDuring the second quarter, our business delivered net revenue growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth, remaining agile despite facing difficult net revenue growth comparisons versus the prior year, subdued category performance within North America convenient foods and the impacts associated with certain product recalls at Quaker Foods North America,\u201d said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.\nLaguarta continued, \u201cFor the balance of the year, we will further elevate and accelerate our productivity initiatives and make disciplined commercial investments in the marketplace to stimulate growth. These investments will focus on surgically providing optimal value propositions within certain portions of our North America convenient foods portfolio, amplifying our advertising and marketing initiatives and leveraging our go-to-market distribution capabilities to enable more precise marketplace execution. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4 percent) and have a high degree of confidence in delivering at least 8 percent core constant currency EPS growth for full-year 2024.\u201d 1 Please refer to the Glossary for the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, including \u201cOrganic revenue growth,\u201d \u201cCore\u201d and \u201cConstant currency,\u201d and to \u201cGuidance and Outlook\u201d for additional information regarding PepsiCo\u2019s full-year 2024 financial guidance.

For 2024, the Company now expects: \u2022 Approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4%). In addition, the Company continues to expect: \u2022 At least 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS; \u2022 A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; \u2022 Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8.2 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion; and \u2022 An approximate 1-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.\nThis assumption and the guidance above imply 2024 core EPS of at least $8.15, a 7 percent increase compared to 2023 core EPS of $7.62.\nPrepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast At approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will post prepared management remarks (in pdf format) of its second quarter 2024 results and business update, including its outlook for 2024, at www.pepsico.com/investors. At 8:15 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will host a live question and answer session with investors and financial analysts.

5 Non-GAAP Measures In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nImpairment and other charges/credits We recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in Tropicana Brands Group. We also recognized adjustments to charges recorded in prior years from changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.\nA - 6 Product recall-related impact We recognized property, plant and equipment and inventory write-offs, product returns, employee severance costs, customer and consumer-related costs and other costs in our Quaker Foods North America division associated with a previously announced voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 2024 guidance Our 2024 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2024 core effective tax rate guidance and our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges and other items noted above. Our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2024 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2024 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2024 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2024 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2024 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2024 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\nA - 7 PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information Organic Revenue Growth Rates 12 and 24 Weeks Ended June 15, 2024 (unaudited) 12 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America (0.5) % \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 % (4) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (18) % \u2014 \u2014 (18) % (17) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3.5) 5 Latin America 7 % (5) \u2014 2 % (5) 6 Europe 2.5 % 5 \u2014 7 % 2 5 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 11 (1) 12 % 1 11 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (2) % 3 \u2014 1 % \u2014 1.5 Total 1 % 1 \u2014 2 % (3) 5 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America 0.5 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (21) % \u2014 \u2014 (21) % (20) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (4) 5 Latin America 10 % (6) \u2014 4 % (3) 7 Europe 3 % 5.5 \u2014 8 % 2 6 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 8 \u2014 10 % 2 7 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region 2 % 4 \u2014 6 % 5 0.5 Total 1.5 % 1 \u2014 2 % (2) 5 (a) A financial measure that is not in accordance with GAAP.

The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. For the full year, net revenues grew 6% to $45.8 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 12%, driven by 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. For both the quarter and the full year, organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across all operating segments.\n- Operating margin:\u00a0For the quarter, operating margin was 21.0% versus 20.5% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 23.1% versus 22.7% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin was 24.7% versus 25.4% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 29.1% versus 28.7% in the prior year. Operating margin performance included items impacting comparability and currency headwinds. For both the quarter and full year, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds.\n- Earnings per share:\u00a0For the quarter, EPS declined 2% to $0.46, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 10% to $0.49. EPS performance included the impact of a 14-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 13-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS grew 13% to $2.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 8% to $2.69. EPS performance included the impact of an 8-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 7-point currency headwind.\n- Market share:\u00a0For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.\n- Cash flow:\u00a0Cash flow from operations was $11.6 billion for the full year, an increase of $581 million versus the prior year, driven by strong business performance and working capital initiatives, partially offset by a transition tax payment and currency headwinds. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.7 billion for the full year, an increase of $213 million versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Connecting with consumers through experiences and digital engagement: The company continues to leverage its marketing transformation to build globally scaled marketing platforms tailored to local consumers. In the fourth quarter, \u201cThe World Needs More Santas\u201d campaign was executed in over 80 markets, continuing the company\u2019s rich history of celebrating the holidays. The company leveraged the success of its first AI-based platform, \u201cCreate Real Magic\u201d, by inviting consumers to create sharable, digital greeting cards featuring iconic brand assets such as cherished depictions of Santa Claus and the Coca\u2011Cola polar bear. Local initiatives generated buzz and excitement, such as the Coca\u2011Cola Caravan Truck Tour, which travelled throughout nearly 60 countries around the world making over a thousand stops and meeting over 16 million consumers to share in the magic. In total, the holiday campaign experiences garnered approximately 9 billion impressions on social media. By combining the company\u2019s global scale with local relevancy, the holiday activation contributed to Trademark Coca\u2011Cola\u00ae volume and value share gains as well as unit case volume and transactions growth for both the quarter and for the full year.\n-\u00a0Building a system that is increasingly positioned for sustainable long-term growth: Since the start of 2023, the company completed the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations in Vietnam to a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Limited (Swire), completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Pakistan to Coca\u2011Cola \u0130\u00e7ecek and completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Indonesia to Coca\u2011Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). More recently, the company completed the refranchising of a portion of its company-owned bottling operations in India to existing franchise bottlers and received regulatory approval to sell its bottling operations in the Philippines to CCEP and Aboitiz Equity Ventures, which is expected to close towards the end of February 2024. Additionally, the company recently completed the sale of its stake in the largest bottler in Thailand to Swire and existing shareholders of the bottler. Our franchise business model has enabled the company to develop a strong global footprint with a local touch in markets around the world. The company continuously works to optimize the system with trusted, capable and motivated bottling partners allowing it to focus on building and growing consumer-loved brands.\n-\u00a0Delivering on our purpose by empowering people to drive growth: The company\u2019s strategy is centered around people, starting with the employees who are critical in bringing this strategy to life. In November, the company was ranked #1 on the 2023 American Opportunity Index, which assessed how effectively companies enable employees to progress in their careers in the United States. Around the world, the company provides thousands of jobs and is invested in the long-term success of its employees. Over the year, the company enhanced its learning and related technologies, making strides towards nurturing a more innovative and informed workforce. The company\u2019s 2023 Culture & Engagement Survey results underscore the strong levels of employee pride and growth opportunities with a strong number of respondents saying they are proud to work at The Coca\u2011Cola Company and see good opportunities to learn and grow in their roles.\nOperating Review \u2013 Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\nOperating Review \u2013 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIn addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following:\n- Unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter.

The company has increased its dividend in each of the last 61 years.\n-\u00a0M&A initiatives: In 2023, the company did not make any significant acquisitions. The company continues to evaluate inorganic growth opportunities through brands and capabilities. In 2023, with respect to divestitures, the company made progress towards refranchising company-owned bottling operations.\n-\u00a0Share repurchases: In 2023, the company issued $0.5 billion of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchased $2.3 billion of shares. Consequently, net share repurchases (non-GAAP) were $1.7 billion. The company\u2019s remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $6 billion.\nOutlook\nThe 2024 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2024 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2024 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2024 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2024; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2024; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s full-year 2024 reported financial results.\nThe company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 6% to 7%.\nFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company\u2019s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.2%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail.\nGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 10% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 4% to 5%, versus $2.69 in 2023.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 4% to 5% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include an approximate 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe first quarter has one less day compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nNotes\n- All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.\n- All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales in the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. \u201cUnit case\u201d means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. \u201cUnit case volume\u201d means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.\n- \u201cConcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\n- \u201cPrice/mix\u201d represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.\n- First quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2022, and fourth quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2022. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.\nConference Call\nThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2023 operating results today, Feb. 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company\u2019s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section.

But as most small business owners know, there are times where you need to stop and make sure that your business is bringing in the revenue it should be.\nOur research indicates that figuring out the best trucking rates per mile is the key to making sure that your business remains profitable, but it can also be a complex process as rates are constantly changing.\nBefore getting into the details on trucking rates per mile 2024, it\u2019s important to understand what goes into determining freight truck rates.\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll find out what current trucking rates per mile are and get a refresher on the industry terms to remember as you navigate truck rates.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nHow to calculate trucking  freight rates\nThe trucking rates can be calculated by multiplying your trucking rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points.\nTotal trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles)\nLike other trades jobs, there is a lot that goes into determining the best trucking rate per mile for your business.\nOur findings show that not only do you have to constantly monitor your fuel spend as well as supply and demand, but you also have to take into account your fixed costs.\nBut let\u2019s start with the basics for truck rates per mile.\nA truck freight rate is a price a shipper or broker will pay you, the carrier, to haul a load. The concept is simple, but our research indicates that trucking rates per mile can vary significantly depending on the time of year and current fuel prices.\nWhich can make knowing the national average trucking cost per mile feel like a black box.\nTrucking freight rates are calculated on a per mile basis. Therefore, the most important number when it comes to calculating truck rates is the number of miles between your starting point and the destination.\nBased on our observations, having the average rate per mile for trucking and accurate information about trucking freight rates is essential to properly pricing trips and negotiating rates with your customers.\nBe aware, however, that calculating the overall freight rate depends on various other factors. Below, you\u2019ll find what you need to consider when calculating trucking rates.\nFactor #1: Distance of travel\nImage credit: Nelson Gono via Unsplash\nWhether you\u2019re transporting locally or looking at over the road trucking rates, the distance between destinations is an important part of determining trucking rates per mile.\nYou want to ensure that you have the right mileage from the beginning to avoid any surprises along the way and get the correct per mile trucking rates.\nDouble-check that your driver will not be required to make any long detours because of road closures. Otherwise, you risk job profitability, timing, and changes to the rate per mile for truck drivers.\nFactor #2: The weight of the shipment\nAfter the distance, our findings show that the weight of the shipment is one of the most significant factors for the cost of trucking per mile. It is important to manage the overall weight load for your fleet to control costs and determine your per mile rate for trucking.\nTo be successful at this, you\u2019ll need to consider variables like heavy haul rates per mile, FTL trucking rates, number of passengers, etc.\nOtherwise, you stand to incorrectly answer \u201cWhat is the average freight cost per mile?\u201d.\nWhen it comes to your average per mile rate for freight, it\u2019s best to be on the safe side and start with higher rates per mile for trucking to allow your customer to negotiate while still ensuring revenue for your business.\nWith this approach, your average haulage cost per mile is sure to bring a profit to your business.\nFactor #3: Shipment density\nThe shipment density is another factor that will determine how much room a shipment will take up in your truck and, in turn, your trucking per mile rates.\nDrawing from our experience, once you know the weight of the shipment, calculating the shipment density is simple. All you have to do is divide the cargo weight by its cubic feet.\nFactor #4: Freight classification\nA question that often goes unanswered is \u201cWhat is the average freight rate per mile?\u201d.\nAnd the question makes sense based on our observations given the number of important industry standards to keep up with for freight classification.\nThe National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) has defined 18 classes of shipments that affect freight rates per mile.\nFreight classification is determined by factors such as:\nHaving a thorough knowledge of how to use these factors to calculate trucking rates per mile will ensure that your business remains competitive and profitable.\nOur findings show that most trucking companies charge customers per mile based on factors like:\nYou need to strike a good balance when setting your rates \u2013 setting a low rate may cause you to lose money, while setting a high rate may turn customers away toward cheaper companies.\nA good rule of thumb to stay competitive rate-wise is to keep an eye on both national and local trucking rates. And based on our observations, providing a fair rate with excellent service is the key to getting (and retaining) more customers.\nAt the time of writing, the national average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile. However, this is just a national average, which means your area may have higher or lower rates.\nTo set a fair price for your flatbed truck services, you need to consider things like:\nThrough our practical knowledge, setting a fair per-mile rate means you can pay truckers a fair wage, keep the clients happy, and still a profit.\nAlthough these are the main takeaways on how to calculate trucking rates, you want to ensure that you have the basic industry knowledge to determine other factors that may influence your truck rates.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some key trucking terms, beyond freight trucking rates, to set you up for success.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nThe terms in trucking you need to know\nKeeping up to date with all of the basic trucking terms is an important factor in knowing how to calculate trucking rates and freight cost per mile.\nFirst things first, there are several types of freight trucks, and they are each ideal to haul different cargo. Your freight type will determine your trucking rates per mile as freight costs per mile steeply influence your fuel spend.\nDifferent types of freight trucks include:\nHere are some other industry terms that play a factor in the national trucking rate per mile and that will help you understand what the going rate for freight per mile is.\nConsignor\nThe consignor is the party that is shipping the product you\u2019re transporting. They are also known as the seller and are your customer.\nThe consignor can be:\nThe ownership of the products stays with the consignor until the consignee pays them in full. Still, our investigation demonstrated that that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the liability stays with them.\nConsignee\nA consignee is a recipient of the products being shipped. You can think of them as the buyer, and they can be an individual or a company.\nThe consignee must be physically present to accept the shipment from the consignor unless specifically stated otherwise in the bill of lading.\nCarrier\nImage credit: Quintin Gellar via Pexels\nYour role in the shipping process will be that of the carrier. The carrier is the party in charge of delivering the products to their destination.\nAs a carrier, you\u2019re responsible for receiving the bill of lading and safely transporting items to the consignee.\nBill of lading (BOL)\nThe consignor sends the goods to you, the freight carrier, to ship them to the consignee. However, the ownership of the freight doesn\u2019t legally change until the recipient of the goods signs the bill of lading (BOL).\nA BOL is a document required in the shipping process that involves all parties: the consignor, consignee, and carrier. The consignor and consignee each get a copy of the BOL, and then there is usually a third copy for the bank.\nThe BOL includes relevant details necessary to ship the product and invoice the transaction correctly once it is completed.\nIt includes the following information:\nFree on board point (FOB)\nFree on board (FOB), also known as freight on board, is a term used to indicate whether the buyer or the seller is liable for goods that are lost, damaged, or destroyed during shipping.\nThe FOB shipping point indicates that the title and responsibility of goods transfer from the seller to the buyer when the goods are placed on your delivery vehicle.\nOn the other hand, a FOB destination means that the seller is responsible for the goods until the goods are delivered to the buyer.\nLoss and damage\nAs a carrier, you may have to deal with loss or damage claims from time to time.\nA damage claim involves visible damage to either the goods or the storage container that the goods are in. The damage should be noted on the bill of lading or another delivery document.\nA loss claim is when a shipment is not delivered or when it shows that it was delivered, but the recipient hasn\u2019t received it. This can be due to typography errors in the bill of lading causing the shipment to go to the wrong address.\nFull truckload shipping (FTL)\nFull truckload shipping (FTL) applies to a shipment that takes up an entire trailer. This is a key price variable as it affects the cost of freight per mile.\nWhen it comes to FTL freight rates factors, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s the smallest truck in your fleet or the largest as FTL applies as long as you use up your entire space. Typically, FTL freight will exceed 15,000 pounds.\nThe full truck load cost per mile typically costs a higher rate per mile since your truck is at full capacity.\nLess than truckload (LTL)\nA less than truckload shipment (LTL) doesn\u2019t take up an entire trailer but may need to move between vehicles during the shipping process. For this reason, LTL rates per mile aren\u2019t always standard across jobs and will affect your average LTL cost per mile.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll need to charge your customers a different rate than the average truckload rate per mile if you\u2019re at less than a truckload.\nTrucking rates per mile for LTL will vary depending on how far your company will be taking the shipment.\nLoad rates for trucks\nLoad rates or freight rates are what you charge for a truck to deliver cargo from one place to another.\nLoad rates are typically paid per mile and can be influenced by factors such as:\nAdditional services like warehouse storage, loading and unloading, and automotive insurance may be included in calculating a customer\u2019s load rates.\nOur findings show that load rates also vary depending on the type of cargo being carried because different cargo may need different types of trucks to transport.\nDrayage\nDrayage is a term that involves shipping goods at a short distance via ground freight. Basically, it is the process of moving a large container to your truck.\nBased on our firsthand experience, this may be an extra cost that you have to consider when giving your customer an estimate of the total cost of your services.\nPallets\nPallets are portable platforms used to package items for freight shipping. Pallets come in different sizes, but the most common size that you\u2019ll find is the standard 40 x 48 size to ship items.\nPallets not only make loading and unloading items easier, but they also allow you to maximize space in your truck. This may reduce your total cost and allow you to provide more competitive trucking rates per mile.\nStop keeping unit (SKU)\nAn SKU (Stock keeping unit) is a service identification code. They\u2019re usually displayed alphanumerically or as a barcode.\nSKUs help track products in inventory as they contain all factors required to identify an item, such as:\nHundredweight (CWT)\nA hundredweight, also known as a CWT, is a unit of measurement. In North America, a hundredweight refers to 100 pounds, whereas the British consider a hundredweight to be 112 pounds.\nIn the past, packages that take up less than an entire truckload were measured by CWTs, but it is not common to measure packages by CWT today. Measuring by pounds or kilograms is now the standard.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nIn order to continue to offer competitive trucking rates per mile, you need to know how much do trucking companies charge per mile. Cost per mile is influenced by factors such as:\nFinancing is also a cost that may influence the cost per mile. The cost of financing trucks and trailers ranges from 0% to 30% of revenue.\nAs of July 2021, trucking rates per mile remain steady. Here are the current rates for the most popular freight truck types:\nFuel prices have been steadily increasing over the past year and are a huge variable in knowing how to calculate transportation rates.\nThe national diesel price was sitting at $3.34 per gallon, with a $0.05 increase from June 2021 to July 2021. However, in 2024 prices have increased greatly with high rates of fluctuation when it comes to price and supply availability.\nAverage rate per mile for owner-operators\nIn contrast to company drivers, owner-operators are truckers who own or lease their own trucks. These people usually work with a trucking company to get back-office support and find trucking jobs.\nOwner-operators generally earn about 70 to 80 percent of the loads they take. For example, if flatbed truck transport is $3.14 per mile, the owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. If they\u2019re out on the road often, they may earn up to $156,000 annually.\nWhere does the rest of your per-mile rate go? The remaining 20 to 30 percent goes to your trucking company. An owner-operator at a trucking company benefits from access to cargo jobs, in-house mechanics, and gas station location optimization.\nBeing an owner-operator is a great way to earn more money, but it also means you will be dealing with the stress and finances largely on your own.\nFor example, you\u2019ll have to shoulder truck maintenance, health insurance, and other business expenses.\nIf you\u2019re not prepared to take on the added risk and costs, becoming a company trucker is always viable.\nTrucking rates per mile 2024 FAQs:\nHere are the top questions truckers have in 2024:\nDo trucking companies pay for empty miles?\nEmpty miles, also known as non-revenue or deadhead miles, are miles garnered by the truck when it isn\u2019t earning any revenue.\nBased on our observations, this happens when there\u2019s a load to the destination but no load back. Empty miles range from 33 \u2013 40% of total miles driven, making them very wasteful for your trucking business.\nTo avoid empty miles, try to minimize any unnecessary movement of goods and improve your scheduling so that your trucks are carrying a load as often as possible.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid an empty mile, it\u2019s best to add a portion of it to your rate per mile trucking costs.\nWhat is a good rate per mile for trucking companies to charge?\nAfter putting it to the test, it is difficult to determine an average rate for trucking rates per mile, but if you keep up with industry news, you\u2019ll always have a good idea of average trucking rates.\nTo answer your question on what is the going rate per mile for trucking \u2014 current trucking rates per mile 2024 averages are:\nKeep in mind that these are just average per mile trucking rates, and your business may profit from a different rate. Based on our observations, providing the lowest rates may not be enough to bring your revenue, but a rate that\u2019s too high may price you out of the competition.\nThe same goes for how much you offer your drivers. As per our expertise, you need to know what is the average rate per mile for truck drivers in your area so you can be fair as well as competitive when it comes to wages.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nThe average going rates for trucking per mile are:\nMany things influence trucking freight rates. Some key factors include:\nWhy are trucking rates so low?\nOur findings show that recent trucking rates are low because of a larger supply compared to the available demand.\nWhen the pandemic began, people needed more things shipped, and the for-hire trucking market soared. Trucking companies started large recruiting drives, and many people decided to start trucking businesses of their own.\nBut now that the volume of shipments is falling to pre-pandemic levels, there are simply too many truckers and not enough demand for shipments by truck. As the laws of supply and demand dictate, an abundance of supply means that prices are going to fall.\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s thrown a wrench in the trucking industry. Recent global developments, such as the war in Ukraine raising fuel prices and a COVID resurgence in China\u2019s export centers causing commodity prices to rise, have made it harder for truckers to make a profit.\nThat said, the decreased demand for consumer goods doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad for truckers. While consumer goods shipments are down, 70-80% of freight consists of manufactured goods, and manufacturing companies are still willing to pay for truck deliveries.\nHow much do owner-operators make per mile?\nOwner-operators generally make 70 to 80% of their load per mile.\nIf we take flatbed rates as an example, a flatbed truck owner-operator stands to make up to $2.51 per mile out of the $3.14 per mile average rate.\nThe rest of the money goes to the trucking company to pay for benefits such as:\nThis is in contrast to company drivers, who may only get 38 to 52 cents per mile with the same load. However, the larger cut that owner-operators get comes with extra risks.\nAlthough they get benefits from their trucking company, owner-operators are still independent contractors who need to do everything themselves.\nWhile owner-operators stand to gain more money, they also need to set aside more cash for life and automotive insurance, fuel and maintenance, and taxes.\nBecause of this, owner-operators are more likely to be experienced truckers. Typically, those who have worked as company drivers for several years want more freedom and the chance to make their own decisions.\nIf you\u2019re a new trucker or are simply averse to taking more risks and responsibilities, you can become a company driver first to gain more experience and confidence.\nHow much does a freight broker charge per load?\nFreight brokers usually charge around 25-35% of the load.\nA freight broker is a middleman between a shipper and the carrier. They take the shipment from the customer and contact a carrier fleet to take the shipment to its destination.\nShippers like working with freight brokers because the broker deals with everything related to the carriers, becoming the single point of contact for updates. On the other side, carriers also like working with freight brokers because they can optimize routes and give the truckers multiple shipments to reduce deadhead miles.\nWhy trucking rates are important\nYour number one goal is to have a profitable trucking business, and keeping up with average trucking rates per mile is the best way to ensure that your business continues to grow. The key to this is having the right cost per mile trucking, so you win jobs and turn a profit.\nHopefully, you\u2019ve learned everything from what is the average rate per mile for hauling freight to standard truck shipping rates per mile in this article.\nTo recap, the truck rates you use for your business can be influenced by the:\nBy becoming an expert on what is the average trucking rate per mile and keeping up with industry trends, you\u2019ll be able to offer competitive prices and attract more customers, meaning more revenue.\nImage credit: Zetong Li via\u00a0Unsplash\nStreamline your business with Method\nStart your free trial \u2014 no credit card, no contract.\nFeatures\nCompany\n\nResources\nSupport\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Method Integration.

Significant business model issues have been starting to manifest for fleets already deploying battery-electric trucks.\nIn many respects, Sanchez\u2019s message echoed that of J.B. Hunt President Shelley Simpson the previous day.\nBEV Technology is Still in its Infancy\nLooking at diesel versus electric in light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Sanchez said that while Ryder expected to see cost increases for adopting BEVs instead of conventional diesel trucks, they did not expect to see the magnitude of those costs, which he cited as a major barrier to widespread adoption at the current time.\n\u201cWe know the commercial EVs beyond light-duty transit vans are not ready for mass adoption due to price range and payload limitations,\u201d Sanchez told show attendees.\n\u201cWe also know that we have a lack of critical charging infrastructure, and we would [have to] make major improvements to their power grid in order to support it.\n\u201cFrom our point of view, for commercial EVs to work in the real world, we need a breakthrough in battery technology and an expansion of the charging infrastructure. We need an inflection point.\u201d\nToday's EVs are Like the First Mobile Phones\nSanchez produced a vintage Motorola \u201cbrick\u201d cell phone from the podium to make his next point: That BEV technology \u2014 much like the brick cell phone in the late 1970s \u2014 is still in the very earliest stage of its development path.\nOver time, of course, cellphone technology improved exponentially. Better batteries were developed. Phones got smaller. And, as more and more capabilities were added, they eventually evolved into smartphones.\nThere\u2019s a distinct parallel between the evolution of cellular and commercial zero-emissions vehicle technology, Sanchez said. Like the cell phone, he added, the industry needs electric vehicle costs to come down.\n\u201cWe need smaller, lighter and more powerful battery technology to improve the range and capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need a nationwide infrastructure. We need the fastest applicable charges available where professional drivers can conveniently charge their trucks.\u201d\nWe Need a Technological Breakthrough\nThe North American trucking industry clearly needs a new technological breakthrough to drive capabilities up and costs down. The problem, Sanchez cautioned, is that we don\u2019t know when that breakthrough will come, and what kind of changes it will bring.\nThe real-world numbers highlight the scope of issue.\n\u201cAt Ryder, we have a stable of nearly 250,000 commercial vehicles,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd only 60 of those trucks are EVs.\n\u201cWe also have 40,000 commercial vehicle customers. And so far, only 18 of them have chosen to deploy EVs in their fleets.\u201d\nThose figures hold true for the North American trucking industry at large, Sanchez added. He said that there are nearly 16 million commercial vehicles in service in North America today. And to date, only 28,000 of them are EVs.\n\u201cThe problem is not lack of interest,\u201d Sanchez explained. \u201cWe have many customers who asked about the cost benefit of converting to EVs. We found that there was significant barrier to conversion in the total cost of transport, or the TCT.\u201d\nTCT, he explained, includes the cost of vehicle, fuel or electricity, driver wages, as well as other factors that go into transporting the same load the same distance and achieving the equivalent delivery times.\nThe business case for converting to BEV technology just isn\u2019t there yet, Sanchez said.\nIn fact, he added, if you take the average load that is currently being moved by a heavy-duty diesel truck today and convert that tractor to electric, it requires nearly two vehicles and more than two trailers to deliver the same load at the same time as one diesel vehicle, at more than double TCT.\n\u201cI think most of you would agree that this is a tough sell.\u201d\nThe Diesel and Electric Total Cost of Transport Gap\nRyder did the math to better understand how significant the TCT gap between diesel and battery-electric trucks actually is. The results are detailed in a white paper, \u201cCharged Logistics: The cost of electric vehicle conversion for U.S. commercial fleets.\u201d\nRyder analyzed the total cost to transport, in one-to-one comparisons, for transitioning Class 4 (light-duty), Class 6 (medium-duty), and Class 8 (heavy-duty) vehicles operating in California and Georgia from internal combustion engines to EVs in today\u2019s market.\nThen it also examined the TCT for transitioning a mixed fleet (light, medium, and heavy) of 25 ICE vehicles to EVs. The mix was based on the overall mix of commercial vehicles in the U.S. according to Polk Data Services.\nThe analysis is based on representative network loads and routes from Ryder\u2019s dedicated fleet operations, which includes more than 13,000 commercial vehicles and professional drivers, as well as the impact of EV charging time and maximum payload to achieve equivalent delivery times.\nCritical factors include general labor, energy costs, loads and routes, Sanchez explained.\n\u201cWe then factored in a number of cost assumptions using current market prices for vehicles, maintenance, fuel, and charging infrastructure. We also factored in driver\u2019s wages, other professional costs, as well as general and administrative expenses.\u201d\nThen, Ryder took the range and payload capabilities needed to achieve equivalent diesel delivery targets and ran the numbers.\n\u201cIt currently costs about $170,000 a year to run the light-duty diesel Transit van,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cFor electric vehicles, that cost increases an estimated 3%. The cost of the vehicle nearly doubles. However, maintenance cost savings largely offset the increase in vehicle cost.\u201d\nThe additional driver hours needed for EV charging time in Georgia costs a fleet about $156,000 per year. And while equipment maintenance costs remain the same as that of California, Sanchez noted, Georgia\u2019s lower fuel and energy costs do not provide the same level of savings while transitioning from diesel to electric. All this results in a higher cost disadvantage for Georgia than California.\nHeavy-Duty Comparison\nAs the study moved from light-duty to larger vehicles, the cost benefits start to wane even more.\nLooking at Class 8, in Georgia, it costs a fleet about $291,000 to run a diesel-powered truck. In California, it\u2019s about $334,000 per year.\nBut given current BEV range and payload limitations, Sanchez said it could require nearly twice the equipment and more than twice the labor compared to a diesel truck for fleets to deliver the same loads.\nSo for that same fleet in Georgia, an electric truck would take $622,438 to deliver the same loads.\nIn California, the cost to deliver those same loads with electric would cost $648,712.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs and 56% to 67% to convert mixed fleets of 25 vehicles, depending on which state.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs.\nImage: HDT graphic\nUltimately, consumers will have to pay for those prices increases.\n\u201cKeep in mind that nearly three-quarters of all goods in the U.S. are transported by trucks,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSo if you extrapolate the TCT analysis for the entire U.S. fleet of commercial vehicles to a 100% transition to EVs, and passing the average total cost of transport on to consumers, we estimate that this increased costs cumulatively adding from .5% to 1% in overall inflation.\u201d\nCan the Cost Parity Gap Be Closed?\nSanchez said the purpose of Ryder\u2019s analysis is to quantify the current gap in cost between diesel and EVS and to identify the cost drivers.\nThis, in turn, will help equipment manufacturers, technology companies, innovators, and regulators to better focus their ZEV development efforts.\n\u201cWe believe those to be advanced battery technology to address payload and range limitations, reducing vehicle costs, and building out sufficient charging networks and delivering power,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe believe [by addressing] those three areas \u2026 we can start to close the gap and created a cost parity between diesel and electric trucks.\u201d\nThere are also multiple ways to reduce vehicle emissions, including electric, natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, as well as continuing to advance diesel emissions technology, Sanchez added.\n\u201cPeople and businesses will see the benefits of zero-emission vehicles,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAnd mass adoption will follow. It will take all of us in this room and throughout the industry, working together to strike a balance between encouraging innovation, safeguarding the interests of businesses and consumers and the environment alignment.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Freight rates: Trucking rates per mile 2024\n\nIf you own a trucking business, ensuring profitability is crucial. Determining the best trucking rates per mile is key, but it can be complex due to constantly changing rates. This guide provides insights into current trucking rates per mile and essential industry terms.\n\nHow to calculate trucking freight rates\n\nTrucking rates are calculated by multiplying the rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points. The total trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles). Factors influencing trucking rates include distance, weight of the shipment, shipment density, and freight classification.\n\nKey factors in calculating trucking rates:\n\n1. Distance of travel: Ensure accurate mileage to avoid surprises and maintain profitability.\n2. Weight of the shipment: Manage overall weight load to control costs.\n3. Shipment density: Calculate by dividing cargo weight by its cubic feet.\n4. Freight classification: The NMFTA defines 18 classes of shipments affecting rates.\n\nTrucking companies charge customers per mile based on these factors. National average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile, but rates vary by area. Setting a fair per-mile rate ensures fair wages for truckers, happy clients, and profitability.\n\nIndustry terms to know:\n\n- Consignor: The party shipping the product.\n- Consignee: The recipient of the products.\n- Carrier: The party delivering the products.\n- Bill of lading (BOL): A document required in the shipping process.\n- Free on board point (FOB): Indicates liability for goods during shipping.\n- Loss and damage: Claims for visible damage or undelivered shipments.\n- Full truckload shipping (FTL): A shipment that takes up an entire trailer.\n- Less than truckload (LTL): A shipment that doesn't take up an entire trailer.\n- Load rates: Charges for delivering cargo, influenced by various factors.\n- Drayage: Shipping goods a short distance via ground freight.\n- Pallets: Portable platforms for packaging items for freight shipping.\n- Stop keeping unit (SKU): A service identification code for tracking products.\n- Hundredweight (CWT): A unit of measurement (100 pounds in North America).\n\nCurrent trucking rates per mile (2024 averages):\n\n- Flatbed: $3.14 per mile\n- Reefer: $3.19 per mile\n- Dry van: $2.50 per mile\n\nOwner-operators generally earn 70-80% of the load per mile. For example, with flatbed rates at $3.14 per mile, an owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. The remaining 20-30% goes to the trucking company for benefits like access to cargo jobs and in-house mechanics.\n\nTrucking rates are influenced by factors such as fuel prices, supply and demand, and global developments. Keeping up with industry trends and average rates ensures competitive pricing and profitability for your trucking business.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "While Ryder anticipated cost increases for adopting battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) over conventional diesel trucks, the actual costs were higher than expected. Robert Sanchez, Ryder System\u2019s CEO, highlighted this during his keynote at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo (ACT Expo) in Las Vegas on May 22, 2024. Despite advancements in zero-emission powertrain technologies, significant business model issues have emerged for fleets using BEVs. Sanchez compared the current state of BEV technology to the early stages of mobile phones, emphasizing the need for breakthroughs in battery technology and charging infrastructure.Ryder's analysis of the total cost of transport (TCT) for Class 4, Class 6, and Class 8 vehicles in California and Georgia revealed substantial cost disparities between diesel and electric trucks. For instance, running a light-duty diesel Transit van costs about $170,000 annually, while an electric version increases costs by 3%. For heavy-duty trucks, the cost to run a diesel truck in Georgia is approximately $291,000, compared to $622,438 for an electric truck. In California, these costs are $334,000 for diesel and $648,712 for electric.Overall, Ryder estimates a 94% to 114% cost increase for converting heavy-duty trucks to EVs and a 56% to 67% increase for mixed fleets of 25 vehicles. These increased costs could add 0.5% to 1% to overall inflation if passed on to consumers. Sanchez stressed the need for advancements in battery technology, vehicle cost reduction, and charging infrastructure to close the cost parity gap between diesel and electric trucks. He also mentioned other emission reduction methods, including natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, and advanced diesel emissions technology.",

    "Document2": "WBEZ\nChicagoans living near heavy-traffic corridors breathe the most polluted air\n\n\n      Maria Ines Zamudio\n    \n\n From\nWhen Irma Morales moved to Little Village nearly three decades ago, she vividly remembers the thin layer of dust blanketing the ground. The single mother of five lived about a mile from a coal plant.\n\"When I walked outside, my shoes would be covered with dust,\" Morales said in Spanish.\nMorales joined the 12-year community-led effort to close the Crawford Power Plant.\nHow does Chicago's air quality affect you? Share your story.\n\"We shut them down,\" said Morales, adding she was diagnosed with a brain tumor during the campaign. \"But for what? So they can bring more diesel trucks?\"\nThe plant closed in 2012 and was replaced by a 1 million-square-foot Target warehouse bringing an estimated hundreds of trucks per day to the neighborhood. Morales and other protesters tried to stop the development.\nEven the building process polluted the neighborhood. A botched implosion of a 378-foot smokestack from the old coal plant left her neighborhood blanketed in dust in April 2020.\n\"Why are you selling ... [our health] to the highest bidder?\" Morales asked of city officials, saying her neighborhood is basically a \"sacrifice zone\" for industry.\nIndeed, in one of the most wide-scale surveys of air quality in Chicago, some stretches of this mostly Mexican community were found to have the highest pollution levels in the city, along with portions of Austin, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Irving Park and Avondale that see heavy traffic or are near industrial areas, an analysis of readings from newly-installed air sensors show.\nThe data is supplied by Microsoft, which consulted with the city and community groups before installing 115 of the sensors mostly on CTA bus shelters last summer, and has been collecting readings from them every five minutes over the past 10 months.\nEven with more than 100 sensors, it's not nearly enough to cover the entire city and that inhibits a complete analysis of pollution for large swaths of the Southeast and Far South sides \u2014 areas long known to have poor air quality. Still, the data provide some of the most extensive hyperlocal measurements of air quality in Chicago, specifically in the high-pollution months of July through October 2021.\nThis story is part of a monthslong reporting collaboration on Chicago's air quality by the Sun-Times, WBEZ and MuckRock.\nThe newsrooms' analysis found that the worst air pollution levels among areas with sensors were recorded last year near the following locations:\nalong 26th Street near Central Park and California avenues, and near the intersection of California and Cermak in Little Village;\nat two locations along streets near the Kennedy Expressway in Irving Park and Avondale;\nat six locations in Austin, with the highest near a bus stop at Chicago and Cicero avenues;\nand along Halsted near 74th Street in Englewood and 87th in Auburn Gresham.\nResidents who live in these areas are exposed to high levels of air pollution known as particulate matter 2.5 \u2014 tiny material made up of many chemicals and other contaminants \u2014 that can lodge deep in the lungs and cause serious health problems. The pollutants measure 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller, which make them a fraction of the diameter of a human hair.\nFine particulate matter is the single largest environmental contributor to death and is linked to a number of health problems, including heart and lung disease and asthma. An estimated 5% of all premature deaths in Chicago can be attributed to particle pollution. Health experts compare the harm of breathing these particle pollutants to cigarette smoking.\nTens of thousands of diesel trucks travel in and out of the city's industrial corridors on a daily basis, transportation experts say, and they are a known source of particle pollution.\nChicago's poor air quality, and many of its hotspots, have been well-known to residents for decades. But the new data reveal the gulfs between neighborhoods. For example, levels of pollution in these hotspots are consistently higher than in neighborhoods that abut the lakefront on the North Side, including Lincoln Park, Lake View, Uptown and Rogers Park. The Microsoft data also provides other insights into air quality in Chicago.\nThe worst time of day for particle pollution readings, at least in Little Village, was the 6 p.m. evening rush hour \u2014 although 6 a.m. was also bad.\nBut even days when most people aren't working can be hazardous. The Fourth of July and other holidays \u2014 when many people clog the roads to vacation, attend barbecues or other events \u2014 ranked among the most heavily polluted days of the year.\nBut it was Friday, July 23, 2021, a 90-degree day, with wildfire smoke plumes arriving from the West, that stood out as one of the year's worst days for particulate matter. Wildfire smoke, hot temperatures and stagnant air worsen air pollution, including both ozone and particulate matter.\nTo be sure, the sensors are not as precise as the high-quality monitors used by the Environmental Protection Agency to take readings and set policy.\nAnd there may be blind spots in the data on the Far South and heavily industrial Southeast sides, where the EPA monitors almost 250 facilities for air pollution.\nMicrosoft said in a statement that it was limited by a lack of bus shelters and gaps in cell tower connectivity that prevented devices on the Southeast Side from reporting readings. In a statement, the company said it is working on improving antenna placements.\nChicago's air is improving but still harmful to the most vulnerable\nParticulate matter pollution has dropped over the past 20 years, largely thanks to government efforts, including programs under the federal Clean Air Act, to reduce harmful emissions from trucks, cars and power plants.\nThe levels in Chicago currently do not exceed standards set by the EPA, which maintains an annual average limit of 12 micrograms per cubic meter of fine particle pollution. But critics say that standard is way too high and the agency is expected to lower that maximum concentration this year. The World Health Organization says the level should be no higher than 5 micrograms per cubic meter, though health experts say no level of particulate matter is safe.\n\"Even a little particulate matter in the air is going to trigger asthma attacks and heart attacks, put people with lung and heart disease and other chronic diseases in the hospital and cause premature deaths,\" said Brian Urbaszewski, director of environmental health policy at the Respiratory Health Association in Chicago. It also can contribute to birth complications, developmental and mental health issues and cognitive decline.\nChicago's particle pollution is in addition to the smog, or ozone pollution, we breathe, resulting in among the worst levels of pollution in the country, the American Lung Association said last month.\nCritics have said EPA standards and methodology for collecting particle pollution data are flawed. The large spaces between sensors \u2014 there are just a dozen official sensors in Cook County \u2014 provide limited data. The agency also uses computer modeling to assess pollution levels in the city where there are no sensors.\n\"If you rely on EPA monitors, you will miss quite a few hotspots,\" said Yang Liu, department chair of Environment Health at Emory University.\nThe more sensors, the better\nIn a statement, the EPA said the Microsoft and other lower-grade monitors give a wider picture of air-quality in the area although they don't meet \"stringent regulatory criteria.\"\nChicago officials say they want to increase the number of air monitors in the city as part of a wider environmental impact study.\n\"The goal ultimately is to get more real-time, more hyperlocal data to help us make decisions,\" said Megan Cunningham, managing deputy commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.\nThe city also is studying seven Southwest industrial corridors and the impact of truck traffic on safety and air pollution. While city economic development officials have promoted growth of transportation, distribution and logistics facilities in the area, the study is intended to address community concerns.\nTraffic is a known \"source of air pollution in Chicago,\" the city health department said in a statement. \"We are doing our part to provide guidance and health-based recommendations to other departments.\"\n\"People who live or work in urban areas ... have health issues\"\nEven though the sensors were largely on bus stops, pollution from a CTA bus alone isn't enough to cause the higher readings in the hotspots around the city. Microsoft said it placed the sensors in certain areas to account for both population and traffic.\nStill, heavy traffic is a potential source for the high readings in Avondale, where the sensor is located directly above the Kennedy Expressway on Addison Street, and in Irving Park, where the sensor is just west on a busy stretch of Irving Park Road. On average, more than 190,000 cars and trucks a day clog the expressway as it runs through the area.\nThe intersection of 87th and Halsted is heavily traveled with tens of thousands of cars, trucks and other vehicles driving through daily. The intersection is near two school bus depots where older, diesel-fuel vehicles contribute to air pollution. It's also near a Metra train station.\nFarther north at 74th and Halsted, there is less traffic but there are railroad tracks for freight trains nearby. That sensor was particularly high for the last two weeks of July and the first week of August.\nIn Austin, an air sensor on the bus shelter at West Chicago and North Cicero avenues is exposed to heavy traffic at the intersection of two major streets. Cicero is also U.S. Highway 50. The area is surrounded by light industry and a large construction project nearby.\nOnce a thriving community, the stretch of busy roads lacks trees and greenspace.\n\"Most people think those kind of [pollution] issues left when the vast majority of industry left,\" said the Rev. Joseph Kyles, who has been pastor at The Promise Church of Chicago for 17 years.\nKyles, who grew up in Austin but now lives in Oak Park, didn't know there was an air monitor at the bus shelter outside the church's front door. He wasn't surprised Austin ranked among the most polluted spots in the city.\n\"It's a known problem,\" said the 61-year-old Kyles, who had a double-lung transplant six years ago. \"People who live or work in urban areas are going to have health issues.\"\nStill, he notes that with the economic and social challenges and a lack of adequate health care in the Austin community, \"It's just one more thing.\"\nThough the sensors were placed within city limits, they could reveal implications for surrounding suburbs, towns and villages.\nOne example is Cicero, where more than 90% of the population is Hispanic and the air is impacted by similar industrial and diesel pollution to neighboring Little Village. Microsoft did not install any sensors in Cicero, but there are several on 26th Street just east of Cicero Avenue, which separates Cicero and Little Village, and several above Cicero in Austin on Laramie and Central avenues. Using surrounding sensors like these, the newsrooms' analysis suggests that high concentrations of particulate matter in Little Village are similarly high in Cicero.\nBack in Little Village, Morales says no one is listening to them. She's been organizing for decades to improve air quality.\n\"It feels like they don't care about our community even though we are homeowners and pay taxes,\" she said.\nMorales, who co-founded the community organization \u00danete La Villita, told neighbors last month during a vigil near the site of the botched implosion that it's important to transform outrage and frustration into activism.\n\"That anger is the fuel keeping some of us in the struggle,\" Morales said. \"It keeps us fighting for justice, accountability. We wanted and want a fair transition plan from the coal plant the community fought years to close down.\"\nOther community organizers agree it's beyond time for government officials to act.\nTiffany Werner, a community science organizer with the Environmental Law and Policy Center who has been a liaison between Microsoft and local community groups, urged the city to begin crafting policy changes, such as limiting the number of new warehouse facilities in a given area.\nThey say while the new data isn't perfect, there is no need to wait for additional studies about the city's hotspots.\n\"The information is already out there,\" said Alfredo Romo, executive director of the McKinley Park group Neighbors for Environmental Justice. \"It has gotten to the point \u2014 what is the city going to do with that information?\"\nIndi Khera of WBEZ and April Alonso and Irene Romulo of the Cicero Independiente contributed reporting.\nDillon Bergin and Smarth Gupta are reporters for MuckRock, a nonprofit collaborative newsroom that works on editorial projects with partners, and brings together journalists, researchers and the public on its news platform.

The new Microsoft data goes a step further.\nBetween April and July 2021, 115 sensors were installed across Chicago.\nThe first sensors were placed at EPA regulatory stations in May. An additional 100 sensors were installed in July, 80 of which were placed atop city bus shelters based on a random sampling of Chicago-area traffic and density data.\nTwenty sensors were placed in coordination with environmental justice groups. Microsoft is partnered with the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago, which assembled a group of community organizations to weigh in on some sensor locations including Blacks In Green in West Woodlawn, BUILD Inc. in Austin representing the border West Side, Neighbors for Environmental Justice in McKinley Park, Latinos Progresando in Marshall Square and the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization.\nMicrosoft's leaf-shaped air quality sensors are solar-powered, cellular-connected devices that collect readings on fine particulate matter, PM2.5, humidity and barometric pressure.\nThey have air vents on the top and bottom and feed data using a connection to a Microsoft cloud service into a real-time website maintained by the tech company. The devices collect data on particulate matter using a Sensirion SPS30 sensor, which is among the best performing low-cost air quality sensors in lab and field tests.\nBut there are limitations.\nThe difference in data quality between the low-cost Microsoft sensors and regulatory-grade EPA monitors is large, said Zac Adelman, executive director of the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium. Microsoft's calibrated +/- 29% error rate is below the EPA Air Sensor guidebook's recommended threshold of +/- 30% but the large error rate of the raw particulate matter readings makes them difficult to rely on for hourly or daily figures by sensor.\nAnd there have been a handful of problems during the study: Some devices weren't able to get the cellular signal they needed. In the winter, devices \u2014 particularly those near tall buildings that block out sunlight \u2014 went into hibernation mode, resulting in lost data. In one instance, a sensor was stolen. One of the bus shelters where a sensor was located was destroyed in a car accident.\nThe temperature readings from the devices are largely inaccurate as the sensors overheated during hot days. The gaseous readings still need calibration before they can be used for analysis and thus were not released with the rest of the data.\nBut when the particulate matter readings are \"calibrated\" \u2014 compared to other sensors in the same network and EPA monitors for consistency \u2014 and compared to each other, they are revealing.\n\"What low-cost sensors tend to be good for is looking at patterns across time. Maybe the exact number isn't right, but you're seeing spikes or dips in the readings across time, or areas of higher or lower concentrations across an urban area \u2014 that's what I think we're seeing is really interesting with these sensors,\" Adelman said.\nThe sensors can also be used to fill in gaps where there aren't high quality expensive sensors, to identify spikes and hotspots, and to empower people with concerns about the air pollution in their neighborhoods, experts say. Microsoft said it is also working to create \"a suite of analytics \u2014 including anomaly detection methods \u2014 to better enable broader accessibility to the data.\"\nWhat we did to analyze Microsoft's air quality data\nMicrosoft gave us access to its Eclipse sensor data through the project's Application Programming Interface, or API. The API acts as a pipeline to the 115 sensors around Chicago and the information those sensors have recorded for 10 months \u2014 every five minutes, every hour of the day.\nIf all this data were placed into one spreadsheet, it would be more than 8 million rows.\nBecause of the massive amount of data, and the details in each reading, MuckRock and Columbia University's Brown Institute for Media Innovation, WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times aimed not to answer all questions at once, but one critical question first:\nIn each month since the sensors have been installed, what areas of Chicago have been PM2.5 pollution hotspots?\nTo do this, reporters stored the dataset in our own database, and then averaged sensor readings by hour, day and month. At each aggregation step, a so-called \"data completion criteria\" was applied to match the data quality standards laid out by the EPA for Hotspot Identification and Characterization. Any sensor's aggregated reading which had a sampling rate of less than 75% in the defined aggregation period was excluded. We also looked for hyperlocal correlations of these sensors and removed any sensor that had anomalous readings.\nAt this point, the collected readings still only showed the amount of PM2.5 recorded at each individual sensor.\nTo estimate how the reading of an individual sensor might explain pollution in specific neighborhoods, census tracts or community areas, reporters used a mathematical formula called Inverse Distance Weighting, or IDW. This is a popular interpolation technique, which makes use of the readings from all sensors at a given time, and uses those readings, based on the sensor's distance, to estimate the level of PM2.5 pollution in regions between sensors.\nThe reporters used this technique to estimate air quality levels at more than 50,000 uniformly distributed geocoordinates in the entire Chicago region and then generated tract level aggregated estimates. These estimates were then normalized based on the average estimated air quality in Chicago.\nWhile IDW is a popular approach for modeling the spread of pollution in neighborhoods, estimates are not as accurate in regions with few nearby sensors. Microsoft's research team also cautioned that interpolations outside the edges of the sample, like those in Cicero, will be more uncertain because the network was designed for the city of Chicago.\nEarlier this month, a project called ChiVes, housed at the Healthy Regions and Policies Lab at the University of Chicago, began visualizing weekly readings by sensor, census tract, and time of week. ChiVes has also collected dozens of sources to help scientists and community members explore environmental metrics alongside demographic, health and ecological data.\n\u00a9 2024 WBEZ\nQuestions or comments about the story?\n\nWBEZ values your feedback.\n        \nMore Local Stories From WBEZ\n\n                Johnny Pippins has earned bachelor's and master's degrees behind bars.

    "Summarized_Document2": "When Irma Morales moved to Little Village nearly three decades ago, she noticed a thin layer of dust from a nearby coal plant. Morales joined a 12-year effort to close the Crawford Power Plant, which was replaced by a Target warehouse, bringing hundreds of diesel trucks daily. The neighborhood faced pollution from the building process, including a botched implosion in April 2020. A survey found Little Village, Austin, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Irving Park, and Avondale had the highest pollution levels in Chicago. Microsoft installed 115 air sensors, collecting data every five minutes over 10 months, revealing high levels of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) in these areas. PM2.5 can cause serious health issues, including heart and lung disease. The worst pollution times were during rush hours and holidays, with July 23, 2021, being notably bad due to wildfire smoke and high temperatures. Despite improvements in air quality over 20 years, Chicago's levels still pose health risks. The EPA's standards are criticized for being too high, and more sensors are needed for accurate data. The city plans to increase air monitors and study the impact of truck traffic. Heavy traffic and industrial areas contribute to high pollution levels, affecting residents' health. Microsoft\u2019s sensors, though less precise than EPA monitors, provide valuable data on pollution patterns. The data helps identify hotspots and informs community activism for better air quality policies.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3.

Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.

The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

    "Document2": "Menu\nCorporate Average Fuel Economy\n\u00a0\nNHTSA's Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards regulate how far our vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. NHTSA sets CAFE standards for passenger cars and for light trucks (collectively, light-duty vehicles), and separately sets fuel consumption standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and engines. NHTSA also regulates the fuel-economy window stickers on new vehicles. This site contains information about many aspects of these programs, and we encourage you to check back as new information is posted.\nJune 7, 2024: NHTSA Announces Final Rule for CAFE and HDPUV Standards\nAfter reviewing the tens of thousands of public comments submitted on NHTSA\u2019s August 2023 proposal for MYs 2027-2031 Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards and MYs 2030-2035 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans (HDPUV) Fuel Efficiency Standards and the accompanying Draft Environmental Impact Statement, NHTSA announced the final CAFE and HDPUV standards. The final rule establishes standards that would require an industry-wide fleet average of approximately 50.4 miles per gallon (mpg) in MY 2031 for passenger cars and light trucks, and an industry fleet-wide average for HDPUVs of roughly 2.851 gallons per 100 miles in MY 2035. \u00a0The final CAFE standards increase at a rate of 2 percent per year for passenger cars in MYs 2027-31 and 2 percent per year for light trucks in model years 2029-31. \u00a0The final HDPUV fuel efficiency standards increase at a rate of 10 percent per year in MYs 2030-2032 and 8 percent per year in MYs 2033-2035.\nThe agency projects the final standards will save consumers nearly $23 billion in fuel costs and avoid the consumption of about 70 billion gallons of gasoline (equivalent) through 2050. The agency also projects the standards will prevent more than 710 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, reduce air pollution, and reduce the country\u2019s dependence on oil. \u00a0The final standards provide critical savings at the gas pump for American consumers and set goals that are consistent with Congress' direction to conserve energy and provide flexibility to industry on how best to meet those goals from proven, available fuel-saving technologies.\nLight-Duty Vehicles\nStandards\nFinal Rule: CAFE Standards for MYs 2027-2031 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks and Fuel Efficiency Standards for MYs 2030-2035 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans\u00a0\nNPRM: Proposed CAFE Standards for MYs 2027-2032 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks and Fuel Efficiency Standards for MYs 2030-2035 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans\nDocuments Associated with Earlier Rulemakings\nCompliance and Enforcement\nNHTSA\u2019s Public Information Center (PIC) is a resource tool for the public and for automobile manufacturers to obtain information on the CAFE and Heavy-Duty Vehicle and Engine Fuel Consumption programs. PIC allows researchers, analysts, media, and the public to easily access dynamic data about how manufacturers are complying with NHTSA\u2019s fuel efficiency programs and provides self-service portals for easy access to the data. For manufacturers, PIC provides the most up-to-date resource tools for compliance. Public information is routinely updated on PIC to provide timely, reliable compliance data, which can be viewed in reports, and interactive table and graph formats. The interactive data can be easily sorted and filtered based on specific areas of interest to produce custom reports, which can also be downloaded as Excel or PDF files. NHTSA will add reports and additional resources for manufacturers to PIC sites as regulations and needs arise.\nFebruary 20, 2024: This final decision responds to petitions filed by several low-volume manufacturers requesting exemption from the generally applicable corporate average fuel economy standards for several model years.\u00a0\nDecember 13, 2022: A new compliance report for NHTSA\u2019s heavy-duty (HD) fuel consumption program covering MY 2013-2020 vehicles is available in CAFE's public information center.\nMarch 25, 2022: NHTSA final rule withdrawing the January 2021 interim final rule and reverting to the December 2016 final rule, restoring the application of the increased CAFE civil penalty rate as mandated by Congress beginning with Model Year 2019, instead of Model Year 2022.\nAugust 17, 2021: NHTSA supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking requesting comment on whether NHTSA should proceed to a final rule that withdraws the January 2021 interim final rule and reverts to the December 2016 final rule, restoring the application of the increased CAFE civil penalty rate beginning with model year 2019, instead of model year 2022.\nJanuary 14, 2021: NHTSA interim final rule adjusts the CAFE civil penalty rate to $14 beginning in model year 2022; if the August 31, 2020, decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Case No. 19-2395 is vacated, however, the rate will remain at $5.50 instead.\nJuly 12, 2019: NHTSA final rule retains the\u00a0$5.50 penalty rate applicable to automobile manufacturers that fail to meet CAFE standards.\nHeavy-Duty Vehicles\nNHTSA Announces Final Rule for HDPUV Standards\nJune 7, 2024:\u00a0NHTSA finalizes new fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans (commonly referred to as class 2b and class 3 vehicles) built in model years 2030-2035.\u00a0\nMarch 15, 2024: NHTSA finalizes technical amendments to the test procedures for heavy-duty engines and vehicles to improve accuracy and reduce testing burden.\nPhase 2\nThe compliance dates for NHTSA\u2019s fuel efficiency regulations, to the extent they apply to truck trailers, are currently stayed, pursuant to an order of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued on September 29, 2020 in case No. 16-1430.\nPhase 1\nTechnical Amendments\nFinal Rule\nNEPA Process\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking\nFuel Economy and Environment Label\nNHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a fuel economy and environment label that will be posted on the window sticker of all new automobiles sold in the U.S.\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n\n1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE\n\nWashington, D.C. 20590\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\nPerhaps the \"most encouraging\" news for consumers is that inflation for household necessities has cooled dramatically, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n\"The prices for staples \u00e2\u20ac\u201d food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they haven't changed in about a year,\" Zandi said. \"So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.\"\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n\"We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,\" Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week.\nHowever, additional improvements are likely to be \"slow-going,\" they wrote.\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their\u00c2\u00a0highest level\u00c2\u00a0in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation.\nLast month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024.\n\"All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,\" Zandi said.\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\nGasoline played a large role in June's inflation pullback.\nPrices fell 3.8% in June relative to May, according to CPI data. That follows a 3.6% decline the prior month.\n\"Tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs\" have led to weaker gas prices, AAA wrote in June.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why Fed policy may make your next trip abroad more expensiveInflation largely isn't Biden or Trump's fault, say economistsMore Americans are struggling even as inflation cools\nAverage U.S. pump prices fell to $3.48 a gallon as of July 1, down from $3.52 on June 3, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.\nGasoline prices are down 2.5% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store.\n\"Food at home\" prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nConsumers have more \"breathing room\" at the store amid \"growing promotional activity\" among retailers, while a few \"major\" companies recently announced price cuts \"that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,\" wrote economists House and George.\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends.\nThey also generally like to examine \"core\" inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThe monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.\n\"Core\" CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI.\nShelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said.\nThe shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it.\nHowever, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021.\n\"It should continue to cool off,\" said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n\"It just takes time,\" he added.\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment.\nIt is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment.\n\"The goods side looks very benign at the moment,\" said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. \"Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.\"\nFor example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a \"notable\" 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\nIt also takes a long time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a year, two or even three \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\nThe services sector is generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market such as strong wage growth.\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades. The labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though it remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n\"Inflationary pressure from the labor market has dissipated quite strongly,\" Cross said.\nDon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

REUTERS/Hollie Adams/File Photo\n(Reuters) - British consumer confidence held at an almost three-year high in August, bolstered by improving sentiment around personal finances and major purchases, according to a survey on Friday that added to positive signals in the wider economy.\nThe GfK Consumer Confidence Index, Britain's longest-running gauge of economic morale among members of the public, was steady in August at -13, matching July's 34-month high. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of -12.\nThe survey follows mostly positive data from companies since Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party won a landslide election victory last month. Business surveys put the economy on course for solid growth in the second half of 2024.\nThe survey's measure of enthusiasm for major purchases rose to its highest level since January 2022, while the outlook for personal finances also notched higher.\n\"This more positive outlook may be due to a mortgage-friendly interest rate cut at the beginning of August, and hopes of more to come,\" said Joe Staton, client strategy director at market research company GfK.\nThe BoE cut borrowing costs from a 16-year high of 5.25% earlier this month but Governor Andrew Bailey and other top officials have signalled they might not follow that up with rapid further reductions in rates.\nInvestors were assigning a less than 30% chance of a September rate cut on Thursday.\nA Reuters poll of economists published on Wednesday suggested the BoE will cut interest rates just once more this year, in November.\nThe GfK report's gauges of past and future economic sentiment cooled, however.\nThe survey of 2,003 people took place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 15.\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by David Milliken)\nCopyright 2024 Thomson Reuters.\nSponsored Bank Accounts\nTags: United Kingdom, Europe\nCredit Cards\nPersonal Loans \nMortgages\nBanking\n\n    Comparative assessments and other editorial opinions are those of U.S. News\n    and have not been previously reviewed, approved or endorsed by any other\n    entities, such as banks, credit card issuers or travel companies.

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n",

States that have the highest percentages of counties without access to maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma and Nebraska.\n\"For too many families across the U.S., the ability to have a healthy pregnancy depends on where they live,\" said Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, in\u00a0a statement. \"Our 2024 report underscores that maternity care is still not prioritized in our country and there is an urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S. and to ensure that these families have access to the care they need and deserve.\"\nWomen living in places without adequate maternity care face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth, among other health complications, the report says. The rates of inadequate prenatal care are higher among women of color and low-income women.\u00a0\u00a0\nRecent hospital closures and reductions in obstetric services have accelerated the spread of these deserts. Since the organization last published a report in 2022, more than 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units. As a result, pregnant people have to travel farther for maternity care, or seek emergency services. Among the solutions the report suggested are mobile health centers, which provide maternal and infant health services to areas otherwise lacking them.\nA lack of OB-GYNs is adding to the problem, with physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance among the factors limiting the supply of specialists, according to a\u00a02022-published article\u00a0in the World Journal of Gynecology & Women\u2019s Health.\u00a0\nAnother more recent factor shaping the OB-GYN workforce\u00a0\u00a0is the shifting abortion landscape, as\u00a0Alejandra O\u2019Connell-Domenech\u00a0reported earlier this year for\u00a0The Hill.\u00a0The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn federal protections for abortion had led to declines in applications to OB/GYN residency programs \u201cfar more significantly in the\u00a013 states\u00a0that enacted complete abortion bans after the Dobbs ruling,\" according to\u00a0American Medical Association\u00a0research.\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\u00a0\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, according to the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 newly\u00a0released 2022 report.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith so much public health and\u00a0media attention\u00a0focused on infant mortality, the latest measure \u2014 which looks at fetal deaths at 20 weeks gestation or more \u2014 marks progress on \u201ca major but often overlooked public health issue,\u201d the report notes.\u00a0\nThe fetal mortality rate dropped from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline.\nBut a closer look within the numbers tells a different story of persistent disparities. For example, the most recent fetal mortality rate was highest for Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders remains nearly twice that experienced by white women \u2014 about 10 deaths per 1,000 compared to five. The lowest rate was found among Asian females.\u00a0\nWhile the report does not explore reasons for the racial disparities, USA Today reporter\u00a0Eduardo Cuevas wrote\u00a0that experts have suggested overall \u201cracial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination and access to quality care may be factors.\u201d\nUsha Ranji,\u00a0associate director for women\u2019s health policy at the research nonprofit KFF, also pointed to the \u201cweathering effect\u201d of stress and other factors that influence adverse health outcomes for Black mothers and other women of color.\u00a0\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21). New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut and Montana were among the states with the lowest rates.\nAmong the risk factors described in the report were maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and pregnancies carrying more than one fetus. The measure does not include abortions.\u00a0\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\u00a0\nThere are major disparities in vision coverage nationwide for adults with Medicaid health insurance.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the overarching finding of a new analysis recently published in Health Affairs.\u00a0The findings offer a state-by-state analysis of adult Medicaid benefits for both fee-for-service and managed care plans.\u00a0\u00a0Among the most striking statistics: About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage.\u00a0\nThe study, which was based on state Medicaid policies from 2022 to 2023, also noted that 12% of adults with Medicaid, or 6.5 million people, live in states that didn\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in the two-thirds of the states that did provide routine eye care, enrollees were required to pay a share of costs in some way.\u00a0\nWhile the federal government establishes overarching rules for Medicaid, the national health insurance for low-income adults and children, states run their own programs. That means they can modify their coverage policies, such as whether eye exams and eyeglasses for adults are fully covered. (For children, federal law provides for vision services, regardless of the state.)\u00a0\nThe study highlights a patchwork of coverage nationwide, with seven states offering no coverage for exams or glasses for adults.\u00a0\nThese coverage gaps translate into real-world health impacts. Eye exams are vital in identifying eye diseases early, when treatment can prevent vision loss. Exams are also vital for prescription glasses to correct refractive errors, the leading cause of vision impairment in the country. Paying for your own exam without insurance costs about $485, the study notes.\u00a0\n\u201cOur study clearly shows that there are opportunities to expand coverage of routine vision services at the state level, and based on previous research, we expect more generous coverage would reduce rates of vision impairment, improve quality of life, and promote health equity,\u201d said Brandy Lipton, the study\u2019s lead author and associate professor of health, society and behavior at the University of California, Irvine in a\u00a0release\u00a0on the findings.\u00a0\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\u00a0\u00a0\nThe data being used to build artificial intelligence could quickly compound the racial bias that already plagues the health care system, reports STAT\u2019s Katie Palmer in\u00a0the latest installment in the outlet\u2019s \u201cEmbedded Bias\u201d series.\nBut, the article asks, could these same new tech tools also deliver a better path forward?\u00a0\nFor example, Palmer describes how Olga Kravchenko, a biomedical informatician at the University of Pittsburgh, used ChatGPT to help identify patterns in ICU care. She found that patients labeled as Native American and Caucasian were more likely to use a ventilator compared to other racial groups. The reasons for the disparity are unknown but experts theorized that Indigenous Americans might arrive to the ICU sicker, while white patients might be given privileged access to ventilators.\n\u201cThe answers to those questions are rarely clear,\u201d Palmer writes. \u201cBut asking why a racial disparity appears in data is a critical step to ensuring that its signal doesn\u2019t get misused in a predictive algorithm, for example, that helps hospitals determine who\u2019s most likely to benefit from a limited supply of ventilators.\u201d\nWith so much bias already baked into today\u2019s health care data, solutions are complicated. One idea: \u201ca \u2018bias glossary\u2019 for every medical dataset, a summary of the data distortions that responsible model developers should be careful to avoid.\u201d\nThis month, the journal\u00a0npj Digital Medicine also explored \u201cfundamental shortcomings\u201d in health care AI, and the challenges inherent in new models \u2014 such as \u201cbias exhaust,\u201d or the residual biases in AI that emerge from actual systemic discrepancies in care. Even though a new AI tool might appear accurate in a controlled testing environment, that might not translate to patient care at the bedside, the authors explain. They also point to the importance of providing developers \u201cdiverse, comprehensive clinical datasets to train models on actual patient populations and scenarios.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re reading\nRelated Articles\nThe Center for Health Journalism at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism \n734 W.

A high Access Ranking (1-13) means a state provides more access to insurance and mental health treatment compared to those ranked 39-51.\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness. In 2022, 64% of uninsured adults cited affordability as the reason. The state prevalence ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\n76.9% of adults with a substance use disorder did not receive needed treatment. Reasons include self-management beliefs (75.4%), not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop using substances (48.4%), cost concerns (47.7%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (47.3%). State prevalence ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n10.2% of adults with a mental illness had private insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.

In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness cited cost as a barrier to receiving care. State prevalence ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive mental health treatment. In 2022, 48.3% reported an unmet need for treatment, with reasons including self-management beliefs (86.9%), stigma (59.8%), privacy concerns (57.8%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (55.5%). State prevalence ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n8.5% of youth with private insurance lack coverage for mental or emotional difficulties, affecting over 1 million youth. State prevalence ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024\n\nOnly 0.667% of students are identified with an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).

    "Summarized_Document2": "The Health Divide: The maternity care crisis worsens, plus stubborn gaps in U.S. fetal mortality rates\n\nMore than 35% of U.S. counties are 'maternity care deserts,' affecting over 2.3 million women of reproductive age who live in counties without a birthing facility or obstetric clinician, according to the March of Dimes' 2024 report. States with the highest percentages of counties lacking maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, emphasized the urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S.\n\nWomen in these areas face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth and other health complications. The rates of inadequate prenatal care are higher among women of color and low-income women. Since 2022, over 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units, forcing pregnant individuals to travel farther for care or seek emergency services. Solutions suggested include mobile health centers.\n\nA lack of OB-GYNs, driven by factors like physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance, exacerbates the problem. The shifting abortion landscape, particularly after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn federal protections for abortion, has also led to declines in OB/GYN residency applications, especially in the 13 states with complete abortion bans.\n\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\n\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, with the rate dropping from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline. However, disparities persist, with the highest rates among Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, nearly twice that of white women. The lowest rate was among Asian females. Factors contributing to these disparities include racial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination, and access to quality care.\n\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21), and lowest in New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut, and Montana. Risk factors include maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and multiple pregnancies.\n\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\n\nA new analysis in Health Affairs highlights major disparities in vision coverage for adults with Medicaid. About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage, and 12% live in states that don\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in states that provide routine eye care, enrollees often have to share costs.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of eye exams in identifying diseases early and providing prescription glasses. Without insurance, an eye exam costs about $485. Expanding coverage could reduce vision impairment rates, improve quality of life, and promote health equity.\n\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\n\nArtificial intelligence could compound existing racial biases in healthcare, but it also has the potential to offer better solutions. For example, Olga Kravchenko used ChatGPT to identify patterns in ICU care, finding disparities in ventilator use among different racial groups. Addressing why these disparities appear is crucial to prevent misuse in predictive algorithms.\n\nThe journal npj Digital Medicine discusses the 'bias exhaust' in AI, where residual biases from systemic discrepancies in care affect new models. Providing developers with diverse, comprehensive clinical datasets is essential for training models on actual patient populations and scenarios.",

It's unfortunate to be in the same race as a Frenchman as the crowd was cheering for him and I felt I had to put on a bit of a show,\u201d reflected a smiling Warholm, talking to Norwegian TV.\n\u201cIn retrospect, I could have let him [France's Clement Ducos] go, but I don't think that matters much.

(More Sports News)\nDuplantis has broken the world record three times this year; the second time was when he won his second Olympic gold medal in Paris, and the most recent in a league meet in Poland on Aug. 25, clearing 6.26 meters.\nBut after he made 5.92 that nobody else could match in Brussels, he nailed 6.11 at his first attempt and stopped. \nThat was one centimeter more than his own Memorial Van Damme record set last year, and he said he was too tired to continue. \nAfterwards, he said his 100-meter victory over 400 hurdles world record-holder Karsten Warholm in Zurich last week took more out of him than expected.\n\u201cMy legs felt terrible tonight and I'm just really tired,\u201d Duplantis said. \"It's been a crazy couple of weeks: The race against Karsten and then I had to jump the day after. That took a lot more from my body that I expected.\n\u201cWith 6.11 I got a good result, but the world record wasn't meant to be. It's not easy to do better each time. \n\"Everything needs to come together. I had some good jumps tonight and I'm really happy about that. Now it's time to celebrate my beautiful season.\u201d\nJakob Ingebrigtsen won the men's 1,500 meters in a photo finish. The Norwegian star timed 3:30.07 after a typical last-lap surge.\nTimothy Cheruiyot of Kenya was barely second in 3:30.93, and just nosed Cole Hocker, the surprising Olympic champion from the U.S., by 0.01.\nHocker's fellow American, Yared Nuguse, who won the league race in Zurich last week, was sixth, less than two seconds behind Ingebrigtsen.\nIngebrigtsen unexpectedly missed out on a 1,500 medal at the Olympics but won the 5,000 gold. \nHe won the league 1,500 in Lausanne and broke the 3,000 world record days later.\n\u201cFor the whole season, I had some good races and some bad races so I hope to perform better next year,\u201d he said.\nOlympic champion Julien Alfred's 100-meter clash with world champion Sha'Carri Richardson didn't eventuate.\nAlfred won in 10.88 seconds. Dina Asher-Smith was second and Marie Josee Ta Lou-Smith was third.\nRichardson was eighth.\nJamaica's Ackeem Blake won the men's 100 in 9.93 seconds in a photo finish from Americans Christian Coleman (10.00) and Fred Kerley (10.01), the Olympic bronze medalist.\nAustralian discus thrower Matthew Denny broke the 40-year-old meet record. His first throw of 69.96 meters was two centimeters longer than the 1984 meet record of Imrich Bugar. \nIt also was good enough on the night, more than a meter ahead of second-placed Mykolas Alekna, the world record-holder\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n\nAir Jordans: The Sneaker That Sparked A Revolution | F Se Fashion By Nazar Ya!\n\n\nCriminal Amnesia | Sexual Violence in Manipur\n\n\nThe Untold Journey Of Momo: From The Himalayas To India's Streets | Nazar Ya!

The report offers market size and values in (USD Billion) during the forecasted years for the above segments.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Analysis\nThe Beauty and Personal Care Products Market size is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 4.64% over the next five years.\nMillennials are increasingly using beauty products like color cosmetics as part of their regular grooming routines. For instance, as of 2021, according to financial comparison service provider Mozo, the average Australian woman spent approximately USD 3,600 on beauty and personal care products yearly. The simple accessibility of these cosmetic items through various sales channels, with the increased emphasis on personal grooming, aided the sales value. Furthermore, the emergence of cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic components helped the market expansion. With the rising awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products, consumers are inclined toward organic personal care products. It is expected to drive market growth during the study period. Besides this, companies are capitalizing on consumers' demands to expand their share and consumer base in the market. For instance, in February 2022, a United Kingdom-based fashion company, Boohoo, launched a vegan beauty range of more than 50 products. Boohoo Beauty's cosmetics line includes highlighter sticks, blush, setting sprays, cosmetic palettes, and others available exclusively.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends\nInclination toward Natural/Organic Formulations\nThe growing concerns regarding the side effects of chemicals in personal care products, leading to skin irritation, allergies, and dullness, fueled the demand for natural and organic skincare products. Prolonged use of synthetic cosmetics may cause various health issues, such as irritation, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity. However, cosmetic products made of organic ingredients, such as plant extracts and natural oils, do not harm the skin. Natural skincare and cosmetic products that are free from chemicals and transparent about the content are preferred by consumers. This factor resulted in a shift in preference from synthetic skincare products to organic products among consumers.\nTo capitalize on this growing interest, manufacturers are revamping and expanding their product offerings by introducing a wide range of organic skincare products. These products contain plant-based, clean-label ingredients with organic, vegan, natural, chemical-free, and cruelty-free claims. For instance, in April 2022, Shiseido revealed a new skincare brand, Ul\u00e9. It sources pesticide-free botanicals from local vertical farms. The dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits of natural skincare led consumers to seek eco-friendly, sustainable, natural skincare products that offer greater product ingredient transparency. Furthermore, the growing trend of organic concepts through online stores for bio-cosmetic products is expected to boost the growth of the natural and organic beauty and personal care products market.\nAsia-Pacific Emerges as the Fastest-growing Region\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries like China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam present considerable growth opportunities for the market players. It is primarily due to the growing demand for color cosmetics, as many people unleash the potential of cosmetics in their daily makeup routine. Hence, the significant players are intensely embarking on product innovation and mergers and acquisitions as their prime strategy to consolidate the market. For instance, in April 2023, Personal care and beauty brand The Body Shop launched its 'activist' product range in the Indian market. The new line strengthens the brand's sustainable commitment in the country with a selection of skin products and color cosmetics.\nFurthermore, growing awareness regarding cosmetics products, such as facial makeup, hairstyling, and coloring products, with increasing demand for clean labels and natural ingredients, is expected to drive the market shortly. The need for multifunctional products is driving innovation as price-conscious consumers are opting for products that provide hydration and skin protection. The trend of social media influencers showcasing their beauty regimens increased over the past few years. Thus, both local and international beauty companies are turning to influencers to increase their brand awareness and reach potential consumers. For instance, in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, the Honest Company, a clean lifestyle company founded by Jessica Alba, launched its business in China. To capitalize on the relatively small but rising demand for sanitary beauty products, the digitally native company created a flagship store on Tmall Global, Alibaba Group's cross-border e-commerce platform. Chinese shoppers can purchase skin care and color cosmetics from Honest's brand, Honest Beauty. Shoppers on Tmall Global can select from various stock-keeping units, including its Extreme Length Mascara + Lash Primer and Hydrogel Cream, a face cream enriched with hyaluronic acid.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Industry Overview\nThe global beauty and personal care market is highly competitive, with a strong presence of regional and international players in the market like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. Demand is mainly driven by more adaptation toward skincare routines and consumer awareness about brand know-how. The companies improved the quality and product innovation regarding ingredients, functionality, and packaging. The key players are embarking on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation as their key strategies to achieve consolidation and optimize offerings. Moreover, these players merge with local players to gain dominance in the local market.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Leaders\nThe Procter & Gamble Company\nL'Oreal SA\nUnilever PLC\nColgate-Palmolive Company\nThe Estee Lauder Companies\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market News\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. For the full year, net revenues grew 6% to $45.8 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 12%, driven by 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. For both the quarter and the full year, organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across all operating segments.\n- Operating margin:\u00a0For the quarter, operating margin was 21.0% versus 20.5% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 23.1% versus 22.7% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin was 24.7% versus 25.4% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 29.1% versus 28.7% in the prior year. Operating margin performance included items impacting comparability and currency headwinds. For both the quarter and full year, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds.\n- Earnings per share:\u00a0For the quarter, EPS declined 2% to $0.46, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 10% to $0.49. EPS performance included the impact of a 14-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 13-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS grew 13% to $2.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 8% to $2.69. EPS performance included the impact of an 8-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 7-point currency headwind.\n- Market share:\u00a0For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.\n- Cash flow:\u00a0Cash flow from operations was $11.6 billion for the full year, an increase of $581 million versus the prior year, driven by strong business performance and working capital initiatives, partially offset by a transition tax payment and currency headwinds. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.7 billion for the full year, an increase of $213 million versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Connecting with consumers through experiences and digital engagement: The company continues to leverage its marketing transformation to build globally scaled marketing platforms tailored to local consumers. In the fourth quarter, \u201cThe World Needs More Santas\u201d campaign was executed in over 80 markets, continuing the company\u2019s rich history of celebrating the holidays. The company leveraged the success of its first AI-based platform, \u201cCreate Real Magic\u201d, by inviting consumers to create sharable, digital greeting cards featuring iconic brand assets such as cherished depictions of Santa Claus and the Coca\u2011Cola polar bear. Local initiatives generated buzz and excitement, such as the Coca\u2011Cola Caravan Truck Tour, which travelled throughout nearly 60 countries around the world making over a thousand stops and meeting over 16 million consumers to share in the magic. In total, the holiday campaign experiences garnered approximately 9 billion impressions on social media. By combining the company\u2019s global scale with local relevancy, the holiday activation contributed to Trademark Coca\u2011Cola\u00ae volume and value share gains as well as unit case volume and transactions growth for both the quarter and for the full year.\n-\u00a0Building a system that is increasingly positioned for sustainable long-term growth: Since the start of 2023, the company completed the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations in Vietnam to a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Limited (Swire), completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Pakistan to Coca\u2011Cola \u0130\u00e7ecek and completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Indonesia to Coca\u2011Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). More recently, the company completed the refranchising of a portion of its company-owned bottling operations in India to existing franchise bottlers and received regulatory approval to sell its bottling operations in the Philippines to CCEP and Aboitiz Equity Ventures, which is expected to close towards the end of February 2024. Additionally, the company recently completed the sale of its stake in the largest bottler in Thailand to Swire and existing shareholders of the bottler. Our franchise business model has enabled the company to develop a strong global footprint with a local touch in markets around the world. The company continuously works to optimize the system with trusted, capable and motivated bottling partners allowing it to focus on building and growing consumer-loved brands.\n-\u00a0Delivering on our purpose by empowering people to drive growth: The company\u2019s strategy is centered around people, starting with the employees who are critical in bringing this strategy to life. In November, the company was ranked #1 on the 2023 American Opportunity Index, which assessed how effectively companies enable employees to progress in their careers in the United States. Around the world, the company provides thousands of jobs and is invested in the long-term success of its employees. Over the year, the company enhanced its learning and related technologies, making strides towards nurturing a more innovative and informed workforce. The company\u2019s 2023 Culture & Engagement Survey results underscore the strong levels of employee pride and growth opportunities with a strong number of respondents saying they are proud to work at The Coca\u2011Cola Company and see good opportunities to learn and grow in their roles.\nOperating Review \u2013 Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\nOperating Review \u2013 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIn addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following:\n- Unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter.

Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 24% for the quarter, primarily driven by strong organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments.\n- For the year, the company gained value share in total NARTD beverages, led by share gains in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.\n- Unit case volume declined 1% for the quarter, as growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and Trademark Coca\u2011Cola was more than offset by a decline in water, sports, coffee and tea.\n- Price/mix grew 8% for the quarter, primarily driven by pricing actions already in the marketplace, timing related adjustments and favorable category mix. For the quarter, concentrate sales were 2 points behind unit case volume, primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments, partially offset by one additional day.\n- Operating income grew 19% for the quarter, which included items impacting comparability. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 5% for the quarter, primarily driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth.\n- For the year, the company gained value share in total NARTD beverages, driven by sparkling soft drinks and value-added dairy beverages.\n- Unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter, primarily driven by growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and sparkling flavors. Growth was led by India and China.\n- Price/mix grew 10% for the quarter, primarily driven by pricing actions in the marketplace and favorable category mix. For the quarter, concentrate sales were 1 point ahead of unit case volume, primarily due to one additional day.\n- Operating income grew 6% for the quarter, which included items impacting comparability and a 13-point currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 18% for the quarter, driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth across all operating units and lower operating costs, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments.\n- For the year, the company gained value share in total NARTD beverages, led by share gains in India, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan.\n- Net revenues grew 10%, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 5% for the quarter, primarily driven by the strong performance of Costa\u00ae coffee in the United Kingdom and China.\n- Operating income and comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) both had robust growth for the quarter, driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth and lower costs.\n- Unit case volume declined 1% for the quarter, as growth in India and the Philippines was more than offset by the impact of refranchising bottling operations.\n- Price/mix grew 7% for the quarter, driven by pricing actions across most markets.\n- Operating income grew 38% for the quarter, which included items impacting comparability and an 8-point currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 66% for the quarter, driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth, partially offset by higher operating costs.\n-\u00a0Reinvesting in the business: The company continued to invest in its various lines of business and spent\n$1.9 billion on capital expenditures in 2023, an increase of 25% versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Continuing to grow the dividend: The company paid dividends totaling $8.0 billion during 2023. The company has increased its dividend in each of the last 61 years.\n-\u00a0M&A initiatives: In 2023, the company did not make any significant acquisitions. The company continues to evaluate inorganic growth opportunities through brands and capabilities. In 2023, with respect to divestitures, the company made progress towards refranchising company-owned bottling operations.\n-\u00a0Share repurchases: In 2023, the company issued $0.5 billion of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchased $2.3 billion of shares. Consequently, net share repurchases (non-GAAP) were $1.7 billion. The company\u2019s remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $6 billion.\nOutlook\nThe 2024 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2024 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2024 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2024 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2024; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2024; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s full-year 2024 reported financial results.\nThe company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 6% to 7%.\nFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company\u2019s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.2%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail.\nGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 10% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 4% to 5%, versus $2.69 in 2023.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 4% to 5% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include an approximate 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe first quarter has one less day compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nNotes\n- All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.\n- All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales in the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. \u201cUnit case\u201d means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. \u201cUnit case volume\u201d means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.\n- \u201cConcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\n- \u201cPrice/mix\u201d represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.\n- First quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2022, and fourth quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2022. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.\nConference Call\nThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2023 operating results today, Feb. 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company\u2019s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section.

These investments will focus on surgically providing optimal value propositions within certain portions of our North America convenient foods portfolio, amplifying our advertising and marketing initiatives and leveraging our go-to-market distribution capabilities to enable more precise marketplace execution. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4 percent) and have a high degree of confidence in delivering at least 8 percent core constant currency EPS growth for full-year 2024.\u201d 1 Please refer to the Glossary for the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, including \u201cOrganic revenue growth,\u201d \u201cCore\u201d and \u201cConstant currency,\u201d and to \u201cGuidance and Outlook\u201d for additional information regarding PepsiCo\u2019s full-year 2024 financial guidance.

For 2024, the Company now expects: \u2022 Approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4%). In addition, the Company continues to expect: \u2022 At least 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS; \u2022 A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; \u2022 Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8.2 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion; and \u2022 An approximate 1-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.\nThis assumption and the guidance above imply 2024 core EPS of at least $8.15, a 7 percent increase compared to 2023 core EPS of $7.62.\nPrepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast At approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will post prepared management remarks (in pdf format) of its second quarter 2024 results and business update, including its outlook for 2024, at www.pepsico.com/investors.

5 Non-GAAP Measures In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nImpairment and other charges/credits We recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in Tropicana Brands Group. We also recognized adjustments to charges recorded in prior years from changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.\nA - 6 Product recall-related impact We recognized property, plant and equipment and inventory write-offs, product returns, employee severance costs, customer and consumer-related costs and other costs in our Quaker Foods North America division associated with a previously announced voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 2024 guidance Our 2024 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2024 core effective tax rate guidance and our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges and other items noted above. Our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2024 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2024 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2024 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2024 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2024 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2024 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\nA - 7 PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information Organic Revenue Growth Rates 12 and 24 Weeks Ended June 15, 2024 (unaudited) 12 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America (0.5) % \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 % (4) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (18) % \u2014 \u2014 (18) % (17) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3.5) 5 Latin America 7 % (5) \u2014 2 % (5) 6 Europe 2.5 % 5 \u2014 7 % 2 5 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 11 (1) 12 % 1 11 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (2) % 3 \u2014 1 % \u2014 1.5 Total 1 % 1 \u2014 2 % (3) 5 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America 0.5 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (21) % \u2014 \u2014 (21) % (20) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (4) 5 Latin America 10 % (6) \u2014 4 % (3) 7 Europe 3 % 5.5 \u2014 8 % 2 6 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 8 \u2014 10 % 2 7 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region 2 % 4 \u2014 6 % 5 0.5 Total 1.5 % 1 \u2014 2 % (2) 5 (a) A financial measure that is not in accordance with GAAP.

The report offers market size and values in (USD Billion) during the forecasted years for the above segments.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Analysis\nThe Beauty and Personal Care Products Market size is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 4.64% over the next five years.\nMillennials are increasingly using beauty products like color cosmetics as part of their regular grooming routines. For instance, as of 2021, according to financial comparison service provider Mozo, the average Australian woman spent approximately USD 3,600 on beauty and personal care products yearly. The simple accessibility of these cosmetic items through various sales channels, with the increased emphasis on personal grooming, aided the sales value. Furthermore, the emergence of cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic components helped the market expansion. With the rising awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products, consumers are inclined toward organic personal care products. It is expected to drive market growth during the study period. Besides this, companies are capitalizing on consumers' demands to expand their share and consumer base in the market. For instance, in February 2022, a United Kingdom-based fashion company, Boohoo, launched a vegan beauty range of more than 50 products. Boohoo Beauty's cosmetics line includes highlighter sticks, blush, setting sprays, cosmetic palettes, and others available exclusively.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends\nInclination toward Natural/Organic Formulations\nThe growing concerns regarding the side effects of chemicals in personal care products, leading to skin irritation, allergies, and dullness, fueled the demand for natural and organic skincare products. Prolonged use of synthetic cosmetics may cause various health issues, such as irritation, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity. However, cosmetic products made of organic ingredients, such as plant extracts and natural oils, do not harm the skin. Natural skincare and cosmetic products that are free from chemicals and transparent about the content are preferred by consumers. This factor resulted in a shift in preference from synthetic skincare products to organic products among consumers.\nTo capitalize on this growing interest, manufacturers are revamping and expanding their product offerings by introducing a wide range of organic skincare products. These products contain plant-based, clean-label ingredients with organic, vegan, natural, chemical-free, and cruelty-free claims. For instance, in April 2022, Shiseido revealed a new skincare brand, Ul\u00e9. It sources pesticide-free botanicals from local vertical farms. The dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits of natural skincare led consumers to seek eco-friendly, sustainable, natural skincare products that offer greater product ingredient transparency. Furthermore, the growing trend of organic concepts through online stores for bio-cosmetic products is expected to boost the growth of the natural and organic beauty and personal care products market.\nAsia-Pacific Emerges as the Fastest-growing Region\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries like China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam present considerable growth opportunities for the market players. It is primarily due to the growing demand for color cosmetics, as many people unleash the potential of cosmetics in their daily makeup routine. Hence, the significant players are intensely embarking on product innovation and mergers and acquisitions as their prime strategy to consolidate the market. For instance, in April 2023, Personal care and beauty brand The Body Shop launched its 'activist' product range in the Indian market. The new line strengthens the brand's sustainable commitment in the country with a selection of skin products and color cosmetics.\nFurthermore, growing awareness regarding cosmetics products, such as facial makeup, hairstyling, and coloring products, with increasing demand for clean labels and natural ingredients, is expected to drive the market shortly. The need for multifunctional products is driving innovation as price-conscious consumers are opting for products that provide hydration and skin protection. The trend of social media influencers showcasing their beauty regimens increased over the past few years. Thus, both local and international beauty companies are turning to influencers to increase their brand awareness and reach potential consumers. For instance, in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, the Honest Company, a clean lifestyle company founded by Jessica Alba, launched its business in China. To capitalize on the relatively small but rising demand for sanitary beauty products, the digitally native company created a flagship store on Tmall Global, Alibaba Group's cross-border e-commerce platform. Chinese shoppers can purchase skin care and color cosmetics from Honest's brand, Honest Beauty. Shoppers on Tmall Global can select from various stock-keeping units, including its Extreme Length Mascara + Lash Primer and Hydrogel Cream, a face cream enriched with hyaluronic acid.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Industry Overview\nThe global beauty and personal care market is highly competitive, with a strong presence of regional and international players in the market like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. Demand is mainly driven by more adaptation toward skincare routines and consumer awareness about brand know-how.

    "Summarized_Document2": "The Beauty and Personal Care Products Market is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 4.64%. The market is driven by millennials' increasing use of beauty products and the accessibility of these products through various sales channels.

Companies are expanding their product offerings to include organic skincare products. For instance, Boohoo launched a vegan beauty range in February 2022. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam, is the fastest-growing market due to the increasing demand for color cosmetics and the influence of social media. Major players in the market include Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. The market is segmented by product type, distribution channel, category, and geography. Seasonal trends between May 2024 and September 2024 affected Unilever's demand forecasts for personal care products, with increased demand during summer months due to higher usage of skincare and grooming products. The market is highly competitive, with companies focusing on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation to maintain their market position.",

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website.

It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work.

This is a great option for residents who live along the coast or want a scenic ride.\nCar: While public transportation is good, many San Diegans still rely on cars for the ultimate flexibility. Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness. Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website.

It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work. The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north.

Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness.

Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.
