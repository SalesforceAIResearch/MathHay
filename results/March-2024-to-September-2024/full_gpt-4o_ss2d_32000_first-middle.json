It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

To that point, TSLA is still up +14% in the last three months to outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +1% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRecent Performance Overview\nTesla\u2019s stock has stayed in correction territory following its Q2 earnings of $0.52 a share which decreased -43% from EPS of $0.91 in the comparative quarter. This also missed Q2 EPS estimates of $0.62 by -16%.\nQuarterly sales did reach a record of $25.5 billion which was a 2% increase from $24.92 billion in Q2 2023 and beat expectations by 1%. Price cuts to its EV fleet led to lower margins with CEO Elon Musk stating an increasing number of competitors have entered the market and offered substantial discounts in an attempt to undercut Tesla.\nThe auto giant does see this as a short-term headwind with annual earnings now expected to decline -26% this year but projected to rebound and climb 36% in fiscal 2025 to $3.14 per share.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Technical Tape & Valuation\nUnderlying the recent bearish move in Tesla\u2019s stock is that TSLA moved below its 50-day\u00a0simple moving average (SMA) of $209 and continued to fall after dipping beneath its\u00a0200-day\u00a0SMA of $201. Traders will certainly want to see TSLA retake these levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, the correction has helped to normalize Tesla\u2019s valuation with TSLA trading at 87.1X forward earnings which is 38% below its two-year high of 141.2X and closer to the median of 76.7X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nTesla\u2019s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The EV pioneer's long-term outlook is still attractive but TSLA remains in correction territory and there could be better buying opportunities ahead. That said, the leveling of Tesla\u2019s valuation should start to attract more investors.\nSee More Zacks Research for These Tickers\nNormally $25 each - click below to receive one report FREE:\nTesla, Inc.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.10%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 7, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.\nVisit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.\nVisit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.\nReal time prices by BATS.

    "question": "What is the difference between Tesla's 52-week high stock price from September 2023 and its stock price as of August 08, 2024, after it fell under $200?",
    "expected_answer": 78.98000000000002,
    "pred_answer": 78.98,
    "correct": true,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Extracted numerical values from the document\n    tesla_52_week_high = 278.98  # Tesla's 52-week high stock price\n    tesla_stock_price_august_2024 = 200.0  # Tesla's stock price as of August 08, 2024\n\n    # Perform the arithmetic operation (subtraction)\n    answer = tesla_52_week_high - tesla_stock_price_august_2024\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "From the Long-Context Documents, Tesla's 52-week high stock price from September 2023 was $278.98. As of August 08, 2024, Tesla's stock price fell under $200. Assuming the stock price fell to exactly $200, the difference between the 52-week high and the stock price as of August 08, 2024, is $278.98 - $200 = $78.98.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions involve determining the difference between Tesla's 52-week high stock price and its stock price as of August 08, 2024. Solution 1 directly performs the subtraction operation using the given values, resulting in 78.98000000000002 due to floating-point arithmetic precision. Solution 2 describes the same subtraction operation in a narrative form and provides the result as 78.98. The reasoning steps are equivalent, as both solutions involve subtracting the same values. However, the final numerical answers differ slightly due to the representation of floating-point numbers in Solution 1. Despite this minor discrepancy, the solutions are equivalent in terms of reasoning and intended final answer."

the WhoScored rating algorithm. The algorithm is their own, but the stats the rating is based on are sourced straight from Opta.\nOpta review their stats after each game, so the rating is also subject to change for a day or so after the match.\nFor matches that WhoScored does not cover, the ratings and stats from either SofaScore or FotMob are used instead.\nAgain, both SofaScore and FotMob are powered by Opta stats. The only difference with SofaScore is that their key pass stats also include Opta's \"Second Assist\" in addition to passes that lead to shots. The definition for this is \"a pass that creates an opportunity for another player to assist a goal\", however this is a relatively rare occurrence.\n\u00a9 2024 Messi vs Ronaldo | Illustrations by Denis Davydov | Contact | Privacy Policy\nTop Scorers Club\nEdition\nCristiano Ronaldo 900 goals: Remembering best CR7 strikes for club and country as he sets new goal-scoring record\nBrad Cox\nCristiano Ronaldo has set yet another astonishing record by scoring his 900th career goal, a milestone that solidifies his status as one of the greatest footballers the world has ever seen. It's nearly impossible to imagine any other male player ever reaching this incredible feat.\u00a0\nFrom his early days at Sporting CP to his stints with Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and currently Al Nassr, Ronaldo's career has been nothing short of legendary.

To find how much more Ronaldo's career goals total is than Messi's highest WhoScored rating, we subtract 10 from 900, resulting in 890.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions are different. Solution 1 uses Messi's highest WhoScored rating as 9.86, while Solution 2 uses it as 10. This leads to different calculations: Solution 1 calculates 900 - 9.86 = 890.14, whereas Solution 2 calculates 900 - 10 = 890.0.

And, it was nice to actually get a win.\u201d\n Andrew Wiggins had a big role in that, turning in another strong game with 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.\n Trayce Jackson-Davis added 18 points for the Warriors, who are in 10th place in the Western Conference standings and battling the Houston Rockets for a spot in the play-in tournament. The Rockets won their 11th straight, 101-100 over the Utah Jazz on Friday night and are a game behind the Warriors.\n Fred VanVleet had 22 points, Amen Thompson added 18 points and 14 rebounds while Jabari Smith, Jr. scored 14 points for the Rocke\n              Warriors coach Steve Kerr said that is a reflection of just how tough the West is this season.\n              \u201cWe had a similar record last year and we were the sixth seed,\u201d Kerr said.\n              Golden State limited Charlotte to 41% shooting and held its third straight opponent to fewer than 100 points.\n              \u201cI feel like we are starting out the game engaged on the floor and talking, and that has carried over,\u201d Jackson-Davis said. \n Miles Bridges had 22 points and nine rebounds to lead Charlotte, which failed in its bid to win back-to-back games for the first time since the All-Star break.\n              Curry always packs the Spectrum Center and Friday night was no exception.\n              With his brother Seth and father Dell looking on, Curry finished the game 9 of 18 from the field. Seth plays for Charlotte but is out with an ankle injury, while Dell is a broadcaster for the Hornets.\n              Curry admitted there has always been a \"curiosity\" about playing for the Hornets, where his father was a star but said his intentions are to remain in the Bay Area.\n              Charlotte rookie Brandon Miller briefly left the game with 8 1/2 minutes left after his leg got tangled up with Draymond Green while going for a rebound. He had just 12 points after making a career-high seven 3s and scoring 31 points on Monday night.\n              Green, who was ejected from the Warriors last game against Orlando, was later whistled for a foul when he appeared to push Charlotte\u2019s Grant Williams to the ground. Coach Steve Kerr challenged the call, but the play was upheld.\n              The Warriors had no problems scoring against the Hornets, repeatedly taking advantage of breakdowns by Charlotte\u2019s defense, finding wide open players underneath the basket on three different occasions.\n              \u201cTrayce (Jackson-Davis) did a great job on the boards today, gave them second opportunities, and with the Warriors, you can\u2019t do that with everybody on their team who can shoot,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cThey were making shots, they were cutting hard and they were getting second-chance points.\u201d \n              The Warriors played without Klay Thompson, who sat out with tendinitis in his right knee.\n Chris Paul got the start in his place and had 11 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, including a lob over three players to Jackson-Davis for a dunk.\n              Jackson-Davis said Paul thought he threw the ball over his head.\n              \u201cI had some sneaky bunnies and I went up and got it,\u201d Jackson-Davis said. \n              UP NEXT\n              Warriors: Visit Spurs on Sunday night.\n              Hornets: Host Clippers on Sunday night.\n              ----\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\nRegular Season Series\nGame Information\n2024-25 Pacific Standings\n2024-25 Southeast Standings\nNBA News\nToronto takes on Charlotte for conference matchup\nWashington takes on conference foe Atlanta\nPhiladelphia and Detroit square off in conference showdown\n2024 Golden State Warriors Playoffs Picture after loss vs Minnesota Timberwolves: Updated standings, schedule and\u00a0more\u00a0(March\u00a024)\nThe Golden State Warriors (36-33) faced a significant challenge as they clashed with the Minnesota Timberwolves (48-22) on Sunday night. With the Timberwolves holding the third spot in the Western Conference standings, securing a win was crucial for the Warriors, who are at risk of losing their position in the NBA Play-In Tournament.\nDespite the pressure, the Warriors displayed resilience in the first quarter, establishing a 27-18 lead over the Wolves. Veteran players Draymond Green and Klay Thompson set the tone for Golden State in the opening period, with Green contributing seven points and Thompson adding five.\nChris Paul and Gary Payton II showcased their playmaking skills for the Warriors in the first quarter, tallying four and three assists, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nSteph Curry ignited the second quarter after a slow start, pouring in 11 points to bolster the Warriors' lead to 54-46 at halftime. Andrew Wiggins and Jonathan Kuminga also made significant contributions with 11 points each in the first half.\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\nIn the third quarter, the Timberwolves mounted a comeback, narrowing the gap to three points with a score of 81-78. Mike Conley led Minnesota's resurgence with six points, while Nickeil Alexander-Walker also chipped in six points in the Timberwolves rally.\nDespite Minnesota's efforts, Steph Curry led the charge to maintain Golden State's lead, adding eight points in the quarter. Chris Paul and Klay Thompson also provided support with five points each, helping the Warriors retain control of the game.\nHowever, the Timberwolves completed the comeback, securing a 114-110 victory. Anthony Edwards played a pivotal role in Minnesota's win, contributing 23 points, eight assists, and six rebounds. Rudy Gobert and Naz Reid delivered double-double performances to aid Edwards in securing the victory.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Updated Standings\nAfter suffering from a loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Golden State Warriors now have a 36-34 record. While they still hold the 10th spot in the Western Conference, which makes them qualified for the NBA Play-In Tournament, they are on the verge of losing their place to the Houston Rockets (35-35).\nThe Rockets are currently on an eight-game winning streak. If Houston manages to extend their win streak to nine consecutive games, Golden State could lose their spot in the upcoming postseason.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Remaining schedule\nIt's going to be a challenging road ahead for the Golden State Warriors with only 12 games remaining in their regular season. The Warriors are next scheduled to face the Miami Heat (39-32) on Tuesday. This is a tricky situation for the \"Dubs\" as the Heat are also looking to improve their record and get out of the Play-In Tournament picture. With Miami only one game behind the sixth-placed Indiana Pacers, Florida's own will likely be going full throttle to secure a Playoff spot.\nAfter going up against last year's NBA Finals runners-up, the Warriors will need to deal with the Orlando Magic (42-29) next. Based on how the Magic have played so far this year, they've proven they have what it takes to keep up with the contenders in the league. Paolo Banchero has remarkably carried his team, which is why he got his first All-Star selection this year.\nThe Golden State Warriors will need to take full advantage of their matchup against the Charlotte Hornets (17-53) and San Antonio Spurs (15-56) after facing the two top teams in the Eastern Conference. Winning those two games would keep their Play-In Tournament hopes alive.\nTimberwolves Nation!

Solution 1 uses a function to perform the subtraction directly, while Solution 2 describes the scenario in words and performs the same subtraction.

    "pred_reasoning": "The New York Yankees allowed 668 runs in 2024, while the Boston Red Sox allowed 747 runs. To find how many fewer runs the Yankees allowed compared to the Red Sox, we subtract the number of runs allowed by the Yankees from the number of runs allowed by the Red Sox: 747 - 668 = 79. Therefore, the Yankees allowed 79 fewer runs than the Red Sox.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they identify the number of runs allowed by the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in 2024, and then subtract the Yankees' runs from the Red Sox's runs to find the difference. The final numerical answers are also equivalent, with Solution 1 providing an integer (79) and Solution 2 providing a float (79.0), which are numerically identical."

The management is hopeful about extending contracts to its young stars, indicating a commitment to nurturing talent. However, the team has faced criticism, with players like Jordan Montgomery reportedly preferring teams with stronger winning prospects. Despite this, the Red Sox have a robust roster, including promising players like Brayan Bello and Isaiah Campbell. The team's performance in the opening game, a 6\u00964 victory of the Seattle Mariners, was noteworthy. Manager Alex Cora sees the team as 'a lot younger, very athletic,' but acknowledges the essential roles of key veterans. As the season unfolds, the Red Sox will strive to strike a balance between youth and experience, aiming to prove their critics wrong and their supporters right. The 2024 season is shaping up to be an exciting one for the Boston Red Sox.\" - Baseball Almanac.\n2024 Boston Red Sox\n2024 Boston Red Sox Official Logo\n2023 \u2190 Complete Schedule for the 2024 Boston Red Sox\n2024 Boston Red Sox Schedule | Research by Baseball Almanac\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Boston Red Sox home / road splits for the 2024 regular season were 38-43 (0.469 winning percentage) at home and 43-38 (0.531 winning percentage) on the road.\nDid you know that the 2024 Boston Red Sox were 15-11 during the month of June?

    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they calculate the average attendance per home win by dividing the total attendance by the number of home wins. The numerical answers are also effectively the same, with Solution 1 providing a more precise value (69998.65789473684) and Solution 2 rounding it to two decimal places (69998.66). The slight difference in precision does not affect the equivalence of the solutions."

The management is hopeful about extending contracts to its young stars, indicating a commitment to nurturing talent. However, the team has faced criticism, with players like Jordan Montgomery reportedly preferring teams with stronger winning prospects. Despite this, the Red Sox have a robust roster, including promising players like Brayan Bello and Isaiah Campbell. The team's performance in the opening game, a 6\u00964 victory of the Seattle Mariners, was noteworthy. Manager Alex Cora sees the team as 'a lot younger, very athletic,' but acknowledges the essential roles of key veterans. As the season unfolds, the Red Sox will strive to strike a balance between youth and experience, aiming to prove their critics wrong and their supporters right. The 2024 season is shaping up to be an exciting one for the Boston Red Sox.\" - Baseball Almanac.\n2024 Boston Red Sox\n2024 Boston Red Sox Official Logo\n2023 \u2190 Complete Schedule for the 2024 Boston Red Sox\n2024 Boston Red Sox Schedule | Research by Baseball Almanac\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Boston Red Sox home / road splits for the 2024 regular season were 38-43 (0.469 winning percentage) at home and 43-38 (0.531 winning percentage) on the road.\nDid you know that the 2024 Boston Red Sox were 15-11 during the month of June?
