Plus, it\u2019s estimated that roughly 40% of all web traffic is hosted by those two companies combined. But which looks like the better buy today, AMZN stock or GOOG stock?\nBoth stocks were beaten down by the growth stock sell-off of 2022. GOOG has suffered less damage from all the selling, down 6% since the start of 2022 vs. AMZN\u2019s 13% loss. Going back a bit further, to just after the March 2020 Covid crash, the performance of both stocks has been far more palatable, with GOOG up 126% in since March 13, 2020, vs. a 63% gain for AMZN. Over the last five years, GOOG is up 156% vs. an 83% gain in AMZN.\nThose are strong returns for GOOG, especially when compared to the 64% return in the S&P 500 in the last five years. Amazon though? Not so much. Now the question is: Can AMZN and GOOG repeat or beat that performance over the next five years?\n[text_ad]\nIt would be foolish to doubt either company at this point. That said, no stock continues to grow at a breakneck pace forever. Just ask anyone who bought General Electric (GE) 10 or 15 years ago, when it ranked among the 10 largest companies in the world by market cap. So chances are, one or both of these blue-chip tech stocks will start to slow in the years ahead.\nGiven that backdrop, I thought it might be a fun exercise to examine which tech giant stock is better positioned for future growth.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at AMZN stock and GOOG stock, broken into a few key numbers:\nTrailing P/Es: AMZN 76, GOOG 26\nForward P/Es: AMZN 42, GOOG 20\nEstimated 2023 revenue growth: AMZN 11%, GOOG 8.2%\nEstimated 2023 EPS growth: AMZN 1,089%, GOOG 51.4%\nCash per share: AMZN $6.21, GOOG $9.58\nInstitutional ownership: AMZN 61%, GOOG 62%\nThat comparison tells us that AMZN is still the more overvalued stock. However, until recently it had been the faster-growing company on both the top and bottom lines; and it had been since 2016. That was also the year Amazon first turned consistently profitable.\nThat said, Google has way more cash than Amazon - nearly double in terms of total cash, with roughly a fifth as much debt. Considering that Amazon brings in nearly twice as much revenue as Google annually (though that gap is closing), that means that Amazon has been way more willing to spend its cash on things that will grow the company - the Amazon Prime Video streaming service that is rivaling Netflix these days; a new foray into live sports with NFL broadcasts; the Amazon Echo, Amazon Web Services, etc. Google looks more like a cash hoarder. The result is that Amazon stock has grown much faster than GOOG stock in the last decade, though that has certainly changed in the last two years.\nThe guess here is that Google will start loosening its purse strings in the coming years, devoting it to new, exciting products like the long-anticipated and recently released Google Pixel Watch intended to rival the Apple Watch, a new Pixel smartphone, or perhaps Google will join Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Disney in the big-money streaming video wars (YouTube did make a splash buying the NFL broadcast rights). Regardless of what it comes up with, bet on Google spending more of its $120 billion cash stockpile soon. If it does, that could capture investors\u2019 attention the way Amazon did up until the last few years.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either of these growth stocks. If you bought both of them five, 10 or even 15 years ago, you\u2019ve made a LOT of money. But AMZN has been the better performer, at least up until recently. I think that might change in the years to come. Between its cash stockpile, untapped potential revenue streams, and cheaper valuation, I like GOOG stock to outperform AMZN in the next five years. In fact, that shift already seems to be taking place, as the last few years have shown. It could be the start of a longer-term role reversal between two of the biggest, baddest tech stocks on the block.\nFurthermore, after such extreme selling last year, both these stocks are still trading below their 2021 levels despite a furious run-up to start this year. You could buy both (or either, although I prefer GOOG); either way, an investment in GOOG stock will likely turn out quite well five years from now.\nFor a list of the stocks that actually have momentum after a tough earnings season, consider taking a trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Trader.

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

    "Document": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives:\nBuild microtargeting capabilities\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\nQuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nRather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments\u00a0at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases.\nInvest in wellness\nA rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging).\nPropel the social\u2013digital experience\nCompanies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries)\u00a0become more important.\nWe see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers.\nOffer premium products where they matter\nOffering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures.\nIn this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.\nThe authors wish to thank Cait Pearson, Heather Gouinlock, and Keir Sullivan for their contributions to this article.\nThis article was edited by Alexandra Mondalek, an editor in the New York office.",

Despite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age. In emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets said they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe and 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk. 3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers. This intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers. What will consumers want? What consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies. 4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups. In advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts. Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior. This weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers. One beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality. 5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims outpaced sales of products without such claims. While young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023. Younger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims. 6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually. In advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets. In emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States. It\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so. Weight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years. By 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective. 7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually by 2040. A higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well. Where will consumers shop? Knowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world. 8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend. Just because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas. Emerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world. 9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind. Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States. Attempts to grow the social-commerce market in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months. Four imperatives to win the consumer of the future In light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives: Build microtargeting capabilities About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Rather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases. Invest in wellness A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging). Propel the social\u2013digital experience Companies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries) become more important. We see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers. Offer premium products where they matter Offering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures. In this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

The index includes Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, MBS (agency fixed-rate pass-throughs), ABS and CMBS (agency and non-agency).\nThe S&P 500 Equal Weighted Index is the equal-weight version of the widely-used S&P 500.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

series whenever new monthly data are added; the inclusion of the most recent LFS data in the calculation process; update of seasonal adjustment models with complete annual data.\nCompared with the rates published in News Release of 3 April 2024, the February 2024 unemployment rate for the EU has been revised from 6.0% to 6.1%, while the unemployment rate for the euro area remained unchanged. Among EU Member States, the rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) upwards for Spain (by 0.3 pp) as well as for Finland and Sweden (by 0.2 pp each). The rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) downwards for Greece (by 0.2 pp).\nCountry notes\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden as well as Iceland and Norway: the trend component is used instead of the more volatile seasonally adjusted data.\nEstonia and Portugal: 3-month moving averages of LFS data are used instead of pure monthly indicators.\nMethods and definitions\nEurostat publishes harmonised unemployment rates for individual EU Member States, the euro area and the EU. These unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The measurement is based on a harmonised data source, the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS).\nBased on the ILO definition, Eurostat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:\nare without work;\nare available to start work within the next two weeks;\nand have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks.\nThe unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.\nThe labour force is the total number of people employed plus unemployed. In this news release unemployment rates are based on employment and unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74.\nThe youth unemployment rate is the number of people aged 15 to 24 unemployed as a percentage of the labour force of the same age. Therefore, the youth unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the share of jobless people in the overall youth population.\nWhen data for the most recent month are not available for a Member State, EU and EA aggregates are calculated using the latest data available for that Member State.\nGeographical information\nEuro area (EA20): Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.\nEuropean Union (EU27): Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden.\nFor more information\nEurostat website section on employment and unemployment\nEurostat database section on unemployment, including non-seasonally adjusted and trend data\nStatistics Explained articles on unemployment\nEurostat metadata on adjusted unemployment series\nEuro indicators dashboard\nRelease calendar for Euro indicators\nEuropean Statistics Code of Practice\nGet in touch\nMedia requests\n\n\n\n\nEurostat Media Support\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 33 408\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: eurostat-mediasupport@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nFurther information on data\n\n\n\n\nThibaut HENRION\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 31 686\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevena CHOLAKOVA\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 35 304\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: estat-monthly-unemployment@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nShare the release\n\nWas this page useful?                \nIf you do not wish to provide more detailed feedback, please just click on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button to send your response. \n\nNeed help?                    \n\nFollow us                    \n\nContact the EU                    \n\nSocial media                    \n\nLegal                    \n\nEU institutions                    \n\n                        EU institutions\n                    \n",
    "Summarized_Document": "In March 2024, the euro area seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 6.5%, stable compared to February 2024 and down from 6.6% in March 2023. The EU unemployment rate was 6.0% in March 2024, down from 6.1% in February 2024 and stable compared to March 2023. Eurostat estimates that 13.258 million persons in the EU, including 11.087 million in the euro area, were unemployed in March 2024. Compared to February 2024, unemployment decreased by 74 thousand in the EU and by 94 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, unemployment increased by 175 thousand in the EU and decreased by 51 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, 2.858 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU, including 2.259 million in the euro area. The youth unemployment rate was 14.6% in the EU, down from 14.7% in February 2024, and 14.1% in the euro area, down from 14.4% in the previous month. Compared to February 2024, youth unemployment decreased by 11 thousand in the EU and by 30 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, youth unemployment increased by 150 thousand in the EU and by 36 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, the unemployment rate for women was 6.4% in the EU, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 5.7%, down from 5.8% in the previous month. In the euro area, the unemployment rate for women was 7.0%, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 6.0%, down from 6.1% in the previous month.\n\nThe estimates are based on the International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard definition of unemployment, which includes people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks. Additional indicators such as underemployed part-time workers and persons seeking work but not immediately available are also considered.\n\nThe document includes detailed tables showing seasonally adjusted unemployment rates and the number of unemployed persons in thousands for the euro area, EU, and individual countries from March 2023 to March 2024. For example, in March 2024, Germany had an unemployment rate of 3.2% with 1,421 thousand unemployed persons, while Spain had an unemployment rate of 11.7% with 2,854 thousand unemployed persons.\n\nYouth unemployment rates and numbers are also detailed, with the euro area having a youth unemployment rate of 14.1% in March 2024, down from 14.4% in February 2024, and the EU having a rate of 14.6%, down from 14.7% in February 2024.

All rights reserved. Key takeaways \u2022 China\u2019s GDP grew 5% year-over-year (YoY) in H1 2024, reaching the target set at the Two Sessions earlier this year. In Q2 2024, the economy grew 4.7%, down from 5.3% in Q1 and lower than market expectations. Extreme weather, adjustments to calculations of the value of the financial industry, and sluggish domestic demand weighed on economic growth. \u2022 The momentum of consumption slowed down with a decline in income growth. The growth of retail sales fell to 2.6% in Q2 2024 from 4.7% in Q1. At its July meeting, the Politburo pointed out that consumption would be the core engine to boost domestic demand. Consumption is expected to recover moderately in H2 2024. \u2022 Manufacturing investments held up relatively well, with a growth rate of 9.3% in Q2 2024. The expansion of equipment renewals is expected to sustain robust growth in manufacturing investment. \u2022 Growth in infrastructure investment dropped slightly to 7.2% in Q2 2024 from 8.8% in Q1. Government investment slowed down due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. With issuances of local government special bonds and extra long-term special treasury bonds speeding up, however, infrastructure investment is expected to remain robust.\n\u2022 The property market is still struggling with weak sales and sluggish investment. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2 2024. To further raise housing demand and promote activity in the property market, policies to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory will be implemented in H2 2024.\n\u2022 Thanks to continuous improvement in external demand, exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with robust growth of 5.8% YoY in Q2. China\u2019s trade with emerging markets has seen fast growth, reflecting strengthened regional collaborations. Meanwhile, the optimisation of the structure of export commodities continues. Exports are expected to remain resilient through 2024. \u2022 Overall, driven by the implementation of equipment renewal policies and the recovery of external demand, China\u2019s GDP growth remained relatively stable in H1 2024. However, it is worth noting that domestic demand is still insufficient. The downturn in prices has had a direct effect on incomes, corporate profits and fiscal revenues, constraining spending. In addition, growing foreign trade tensions may weigh on China\u2019s exports. The government is expected to adopt a more accommodative macro policy stance in H2 2024 to facilitate the recovery of economic growth. 3 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

However, the growth rate in Q2 dropped to 4.7% in Q2 from 5.3% in Q1, which was lower than expectations. Beyond challenges posed by extreme weather, the slowdown reflected sluggish domestic demand.\n\u2022 The contribution of consumption to GDP fell from 73.7% in Q1 to 46.5% in Q2. Retail sales growth plummeted to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1 due to weakness in incomes. Fixed asset investment growth dropped to 3.6% in Q2, with activity in the real estate market remaining subdued and infrastructure investment constrained by shortages in fiscal funds.\n\u2022 Export growth picked up from 1.5% in Q1 to 5.8% in Q2 due to a lower base and robust external demand. 2020-23 Average 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 GDP 4.8% 6.3% 4.9% 5.2% 5.3% 4.7% Industrial production 5.0% 4.5% 4.2% 5.2% 6.1% 5.9% Retail sales 4.1% 10.7% 4.2% 8.3% 4.7% 2.6% Fixed asset investment 4.4% 3.1% 1.9% 2.7% 4.5% 3.6% Exports 9.0% -4.9% -9.9% -1.2% 1.5% 5.8% Imports 6.4% -7.0% -8.5% 0.9% 1.6% 2.5% Income per capita 4.8% 8.3% 6.1% 6.7% 6.2% 4.2% Fiscal revenue 4.6% 31.7% -0.9% -1.0% -2.3% -3.2% Fiscal expenditures 3.7% 1.0% 4.1% 9.2% 2.9% 1.1% 4 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Extreme weather and weak demand still weighed on production side Manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI Source: Wind, KPMG analysis \u2022 The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 for the past three months, since April, and fell to 49.4 in July. The divergence between production and demand recovery persisted. The production index dropped 0.5 to 50.1 while the new orders index fell to 49.3 in July, declining below the 50 point mark. A reading under 50 indicates a contraction.\n\u2022 The non-manufacturing sector also slowed down. Affected by extreme weather, construction activity slowed in July and the Construction PMI dropped 1.1 points to 51.2. With capital markets and the real estate industry still sluggish, the services PMI index dropped to 50, reaching its lowest level for the year.\n20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Manufacturing Construction and Services 5 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Consumption slowed as residents\u2019 income growth declined Growth of retail sales by category, YoY, % \u2022 Consumption has continued a pattern of differentiated recovery since 2023, with services sales increasing 7.5% YoY in H1 2024, 4.3 percentage points higher than goods sales growth. Robust sales of non-discretionary consumer goods and higher-quality goods contributed to consumption. Retail sales of property-related goods improved to varying degrees, driven mainly by relaxed real estate policies and effective trade-in policies of consumer goods.\n\u2022 The government has identified boosting domestic demand through consumption as a key focus in H2 2024. It sees service consumption as an important lever to expand and upgrade consumption, supporting sectors including culture and tourism, elderly care, housekeeping, childcare, etc.\nSource: Wind, KPMG analysis.

But it remained below the average of 71.0% for the same period of 2014-2019, indicating room for improvement. \u2022 The slowdown in consumption growth was primarily due to slower income growth, as the per capita disposable income increased by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. This was 0.8 and 1.1 percentage points lower than in Q1 2024 and H1 2023, respectively. \u2022 Strengthening measures to stabilize employment and raise income will be necessary to support a steady recovery in residents' consumption ability and willingness.\nSource: Wind, KPMG analysis Note: Residents\u2019 propensity to consume = nationwide per capita consumption expenditures / nationwide per capita disposable income 55 60 65 70 75 80 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2014-2019 Average 2020-2023 Average 2024 7 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Weak fiscal revenues constrained government expenditures in Q2 2024 Growth rate of general fiscal revenues and expenses, YoY, % \u2022 General fiscal revenue growth dropped to -7.2% YoY in Q2, down from -2.6% in Q1 and -2.8% in H1 2024. Specifically, tax revenue declined by 5.6% and land transfer income dropped by 18.3% in H1. \u2022 With shrinking revenues, the government curbed the expansion of investment, causing the growth rate of general fiscal expenses to fall to -4.1% YoY in Q2, down from -1.5% in Q1. It was well below the 7.9% budgeted growth rate set at the beginning of the year. \u2022 Looking ahead, in addition to accelerating the issuance of local government special bonds in H2 2024, the central government is expected to raise its debt ceiling in 2024 in order to achieve its fiscal budget targets.

More likely was that the limited improvement in sales prompted enterprises to stay cautious about expanding investment.

Both sales revenue and domestic loan growth performed better in Q2 than in Q1.\n\u2022 While liquidity pressure on property developers eased slightly, overall property funding in H1 remained at historic lows.

Inflation is expected to pick up moderately China Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), YoY, % \u2022 CPI rose by 0.2% YoY in June 2024, down from 0.3% in May. It was mainly due to the seasonal decline in food prices and the narrowed growth in energy prices. \u2022 Supported by a lower base, the YoY decline in PPI narrowed in June, raising from -1.4% in May to 0.8% in June. However, the PPI continued its month-on-month slide of 0.2%, reflecting the ongoing imbalance between supply and demand facing industrial sectors.\n\u2022 Looking ahead, CPI and PPI are expected to pick up modestly in H2 2024, buoyed by rebounding demands and the effects of new policies.

New bank loans in Q2 2024 totalled RMB 3.3 trillion, down RMB 5.8 trillion from Q1 2024, indicating weak credit demand from the real economy amid a slowing momentum of China\u2019s economic recovery in Q2.\n\u2022 As the government accelerated bond issuances in Q2, net financing from government bond issuances rose to RMB 2.0 trillion in Q2, a YoY increase of RMB 431.5 billion.\n\u2022 Low market interest rates boosted corporate willingness to issue bonds.

This gradual decline in financing costs aimed to convey an accommodative policy signal to markets.\n\u2022 Further cuts are expected for reserve requirement ratios and other policy rates as financial conditions ease globally.

    "Summarized_Document": "China\u2019s GDP grew 5% year-over-year (YoY) in H1 2024, meeting the target set at the Two Sessions. However, the growth rate in Q2 2024 dropped to 4.7% from 5.3% in Q1, falling short of market expectations due to extreme weather, adjustments in financial industry valuations, and sluggish domestic demand. Retail sales growth fell to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1, reflecting a slowdown in income growth. Manufacturing investments grew by 9.3% in Q2, supported by equipment renewals, while infrastructure investment growth dropped to 7.2% from 8.8% in Q1 due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2, with policies expected to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory in H2 2024. Exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with a robust 5.8% growth in Q2, driven by strong external demand and regional collaborations. Despite stable GDP growth in H1 2024, domestic demand remains insufficient, and foreign trade tensions may impact exports. The government is expected to adopt more accommodative macro policies in H2 2024 to support economic recovery. The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 since April, indicating contraction, while the non-manufacturing sector also slowed due to extreme weather. Consumption growth slowed as residents' income growth declined, with the per capita disposable income increasing by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. Manufacturing investment growth was driven by exports and equipment renewals, despite a slight drop to 9.3% in Q2 from 9.9% in Q1. Infrastructure investment growth fell to 7.2% in Q2 from 8.8% in Q1, constrained by extreme weather and fiscal funding shortages. General fiscal revenue growth dropped to -7.2% YoY in Q2, leading to a reduction in government expenditures. Property sales showed limited improvement, with investment growth dropping to -10.5% in Q2. Liquidity pressure on property developers persisted, with funding sources growth picking up slightly to -22.6% in H1 2024. CPI rose by 0.2% YoY in June 2024, while PPI decline narrowed, indicating moderate inflation expectations. Growth of total social financing slowed, with new bank loans decreasing by RMB 3.1 trillion in H1 2024. The central bank cut key interest rates to signal accommodative policies. Exports to major trading partners grew, with ASEAN remaining the largest trading partner. The export commodity structure continued to optimize, with mechanical and electrical products leading growth. FDI into China decreased by 29.1% YoY in H1 2024, while ODI grew by 19.5%. The RMB exchange rate remained stable despite global monetary policy divergence. Hong Kong\u2019s GDP grew by 3.3% in Q2 2024, with tourism and private consumption expected to pick up in H2 2024.",

In Q2 2024, the economy grew 4.7%, down from 5.3% in Q1 and lower than market expectations. Extreme weather, adjustments to calculations of the value of the financial industry, and sluggish domestic demand weighed on economic growth. \u2022 The momentum of consumption slowed down with a decline in income growth. The growth of retail sales fell to 2.6% in Q2 2024 from 4.7% in Q1. At its July meeting, the Politburo pointed out that consumption would be the core engine to boost domestic demand. Consumption is expected to recover moderately in H2 2024. \u2022 Manufacturing investments held up relatively well, with a growth rate of 9.3% in Q2 2024. The expansion of equipment renewals is expected to sustain robust growth in manufacturing investment. \u2022 Growth in infrastructure investment dropped slightly to 7.2% in Q2 2024 from 8.8% in Q1. Government investment slowed down due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. With issuances of local government special bonds and extra long-term special treasury bonds speeding up, however, infrastructure investment is expected to remain robust.\n\u2022 The property market is still struggling with weak sales and sluggish investment. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2 2024. To further raise housing demand and promote activity in the property market, policies to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory will be implemented in H2 2024.\n\u2022 Thanks to continuous improvement in external demand, exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with robust growth of 5.8% YoY in Q2. China\u2019s trade with emerging markets has seen fast growth, reflecting strengthened regional collaborations. Meanwhile, the optimisation of the structure of export commodities continues. Exports are expected to remain resilient through 2024. \u2022 Overall, driven by the implementation of equipment renewal policies and the recovery of external demand, China\u2019s GDP growth remained relatively stable in H1 2024. However, it is worth noting that domestic demand is still insufficient. The downturn in prices has had a direct effect on incomes, corporate profits and fiscal revenues, constraining spending. In addition, growing foreign trade tensions may weigh on China\u2019s exports. The government is expected to adopt a more accommodative macro policy stance in H2 2024 to facilitate the recovery of economic growth. 3 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

However, the growth rate in Q2 dropped to 4.7% in Q2 from 5.3% in Q1, which was lower than expectations. Beyond challenges posed by extreme weather, the slowdown reflected sluggish domestic demand.\n\u2022 The contribution of consumption to GDP fell from 73.7% in Q1 to 46.5% in Q2. Retail sales growth plummeted to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1 due to weakness in incomes. Fixed asset investment growth dropped to 3.6% in Q2, with activity in the real estate market remaining subdued and infrastructure investment constrained by shortages in fiscal funds.\n\u2022 Export growth picked up from 1.5% in Q1 to 5.8% in Q2 due to a lower base and robust external demand. 2020-23 Average 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 GDP 4.8% 6.3% 4.9% 5.2% 5.3% 4.7% Industrial production 5.0% 4.5% 4.2% 5.2% 6.1% 5.9% Retail sales 4.1% 10.7% 4.2% 8.3% 4.7% 2.6% Fixed asset investment 4.4% 3.1% 1.9% 2.7% 4.5% 3.6% Exports 9.0% -4.9% -9.9% -1.2% 1.5% 5.8% Imports 6.4% -7.0% -8.5% 0.9% 1.6% 2.5% Income per capita 4.8% 8.3% 6.1% 6.7% 6.2% 4.2% Fiscal revenue 4.6% 31.7% -0.9% -1.0% -2.3% -3.2% Fiscal expenditures 3.7% 1.0% 4.1% 9.2% 2.9% 1.1% 4 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

However, the growth rate in Q2 2024 dropped to 4.7% from 5.3% in Q1, falling short of market expectations due to extreme weather, adjustments in financial industry valuations, and sluggish domestic demand. Retail sales growth fell to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1, reflecting a slowdown in income growth. Manufacturing investments grew by 9.3% in Q2, supported by equipment renewals, while infrastructure investment growth dropped to 7.2% from 8.8% in Q1 due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2, with policies expected to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory in H2 2024. Exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with a robust 5.8% growth in Q2, driven by strong external demand and regional collaborations. Despite stable GDP growth in H1 2024, domestic demand remains insufficient, and foreign trade tensions may impact exports. The government is expected to adopt more accommodative macro policies in H2 2024 to support economic recovery. The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 since April, indicating contraction, while the non-manufacturing sector also slowed due to extreme weather. Consumption growth slowed as residents' income growth declined, with the per capita disposable income increasing by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. Manufacturing investment growth was driven by exports and equipment renewals, despite a slight drop to 9.3% in Q2 from 9.9% in Q1. Infrastructure investment growth fell to 7.2% in Q2 from 8.8% in Q1, constrained by extreme weather and fiscal funding shortages. General fiscal revenue growth dropped to -7.2% YoY in Q2, leading to a reduction in government expenditures. Property sales showed limited improvement, with investment growth dropping to -10.5% in Q2. Liquidity pressure on property developers persisted, with funding sources growth picking up slightly to -22.6% in H1 2024. CPI rose by 0.2% YoY in June 2024, while PPI decline narrowed, indicating moderate inflation expectations. Growth of total social financing slowed, with new bank loans decreasing by RMB 3.1 trillion in H1 2024. The central bank cut key interest rates to signal accommodative policies. Exports to major trading partners grew, with ASEAN remaining the largest trading partner. The export commodity structure continued to optimize, with mechanical and electrical products leading growth. FDI into China decreased by 29.1% YoY in H1 2024, while ODI grew by 19.5%. The RMB exchange rate remained stable despite global monetary policy divergence. Hong Kong\u2019s GDP grew by 3.3% in Q2 2024, with tourism and private consumption expected to pick up in H2 2024.",

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6). The percentage of deaths coded as influenza during Week 11 was 0.0% compared to 0.1% during Week 10 (Figure 7).\n4 24 1 24 104 1 25 166 28 34 520 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Deaths ICU Non-ICU Percentage of Influenza Hospitalizations Severity of Hospitalization <18 years 18-49 years 50-64 years \u226565 years 9 of 20 Figure 6.

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). Methods used to identify pediatric influenza-coded deaths on death certificates differ from those used to identify the influenza-associated pediatric deaths presented below, which require laboratory confirmation of influenza, and might not include the same individuals. One laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated death in a child <18 years of age was reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received nine reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths among children <18 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season. Influenza-associated Outbreaks Two laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks were reported during Week 11. To date, 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported to CDPH during the 2023\u20132024 season. One previously reported outbreak was removed because it did not meet the outbreak definition. Figure 9.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10.

Figure 12. Percentage of RSV Detections at Clinical Sentinel Laboratories, 2018\u20132024 Season to Date RSV Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cRSV,\u201d \u201csyncytial,\u201d \u201cbronchiolitis,\u201d and variants of the keywords are defined as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related admissions. The number of RSV admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same period to estimate the percentage of RSV admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. The percentage of admissions for RSV in Kaiser Permanente facilities in northern California during Week 11 was 0.3% compared to 0.3% during Week 10 (Figure 13). 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 40 Oct 42 44 Nov 46 48 Dec 50 52 2 Jan 4 6 Feb 8 10 Mar 12 14 Apr 16 18 May 20 22 Jun 24 26 28 Jul 30 32 Aug 34 36 Sep 38 Percentage of Specimens Tested Positive for RSV Week 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-2022 2022-2023 2023-2024 Note: Data have been shifted so that Week 1 aligns across seasons. 15 of 20 Figure 13. Percentage of RSV Admissions in Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2018\u2013 2024 Season to Date To date, 802 non-intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations, 123 ICU admissions, and 20 deaths have occurred among persons with RSV admission diagnoses. Most RSV admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 14). Please note that RSV admissions serve as a proxy for RSV activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed RSV infections. Figure 14.

RSV-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are likely to be an underestimate of all RSV-associated deaths. During Week 11, ten RSV-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 295 RSV-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 15). The percentage of deaths coded as RSV during Week 11 was 0.11% compared to 0.19% during Week 10 (Figure 16). Figure 15.

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). No laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated deaths in children <5 years of age were reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received three reports of laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated deaths among children <5 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season.

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6).

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). Methods used to identify pediatric influenza-coded deaths on death certificates differ from those used to identify the influenza-associated pediatric deaths presented below, which require laboratory confirmation of influenza, and might not include the same individuals. One laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated death in a child <18 years of age was reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received nine reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths among children <18 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season. Influenza-associated Outbreaks Two laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks were reported during Week 11. To date, 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported to CDPH during the 2023\u20132024 season. One previously reported outbreak was removed because it did not meet the outbreak definition. Figure 9.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10.

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

    "Summarized_Document": "Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJonathan H. Pelletier, Jaskaran Rakkar, Alicia K. Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

The rising demand for antidepressant drugs affects market prices as well. Patients may find antidepressants to be more affordable because many of them are available in generic form.\u00a0\nWhich Region is Expanding at the Fastest CAGR?\nAsia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth in the antidepressant drugs market during the forecast period. Changes in the financial system, societal norms, and lifestyle might increase the likelihood of mental health issues like depression, which in turn drives up the need for antidepressant drugs. The aging population raises the possibility of mental health issues like depression. This shift in the population might support the growth of the antidepressant industry. The market will grow if government initiatives are implemented to provide access to basic treatment for all mental health conditions. Additionally, the market is growing due to growing sales of CNS stimulants, an increase in the number of persons experiencing stress, and growing awareness about the illness state and necessary treatment needs.\r\n\u00a0\nThe current report Scope analyzes Antidepressant Drugs Market on 5 major region Split (In case you wish to acquire a specific region edition (more granular data) or any country Edition data then please write us on info@cognitivemarketresearch.com\n\nNorth America (United States, Canada, Mexico)\nEurope (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium)\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Rest of APAC)\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Rest of South America)\nMiddle East and Africa (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nigeria, UAE, Egypt, South Africa, GCC Countries, Rest of MEA)\n\n\n\nAntidepressant Drugs Market Share (%) by Region (2019-2031)\n\n\nThe above graph is for illustrative purposes only.

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

The Canadian healthcare system places a high priority on mental health, and a sizable portion of its budget is allocated to services and initiatives in this area.

The rising demand for antidepressant drugs affects market prices as well. Patients may find antidepressants to be more affordable because many of them are available in generic form.\u00a0\nWhich Region is Expanding at the Fastest CAGR?\nAsia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth in the antidepressant drugs market during the forecast period. Changes in the financial system, societal norms, and lifestyle might increase the likelihood of mental health issues like depression, which in turn drives up the need for antidepressant drugs. The aging population raises the possibility of mental health issues like depression. This shift in the population might support the growth of the antidepressant industry. The market will grow if government initiatives are implemented to provide access to basic treatment for all mental health conditions. Additionally, the market is growing due to growing sales of CNS stimulants, an increase in the number of persons experiencing stress, and growing awareness about the illness state and necessary treatment needs.\r\n\u00a0\nThe current report Scope analyzes Antidepressant Drugs Market on 5 major region Split (In case you wish to acquire a specific region edition (more granular data) or any country Edition data then please write us on info@cognitivemarketresearch.com\n\nNorth America (United States, Canada, Mexico)\nEurope (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium)\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Rest of APAC)\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Rest of South America)\nMiddle East and Africa (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nigeria, UAE, Egypt, South Africa, GCC Countries, Rest of MEA)\n\n\n\nAntidepressant Drugs Market Share (%) by Region (2019-2031)\n\n\nThe above graph is for illustrative purposes only.

    "Document": "New COVID vaccines are here. What to know about latest shots in wake of nation\u2019s biggest summer surge\nOn the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers.\nBack in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early.\nManufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use.\nIn considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants.\n\u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d\nWho can get a new COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children:\nAdults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults.\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses.\nI recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine?\nYes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months.\nHowever, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area.\nI just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one?\nFor people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician.\nIf you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated.\nAre the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same?\nBoth use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them.\nComirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nSpikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nAll new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine?\nWhile the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift.\n\u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d\nTaking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2.\nI got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine?\nYes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter.\nIn the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d\nHopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity.\n\u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19.\n\u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d\nCan you get COVID from the vaccine?\nNo. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d\nBecause younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body.\nBen-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d\nCan I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time?\nYes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d\nCan I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated?\nYes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death.\nDoes insurance cover the new COVID vaccine?\nThe vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program.\nThe 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients.\n\u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d\nWhere can I get the new COVID vaccine?\nVisit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829.\nDo I still need a COVID vaccination card?\nIf you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones.\nThe CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.\nFor more on COVID-19 and vaccines:\nSubscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.

Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift. \u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d Taking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2. I got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine? Yes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter. In the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d Hopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity. \u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19. \u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d Can you get COVID from the vaccine? No. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains. \u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d Because younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body. Ben-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d Can I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time? Yes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d Can I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated? Yes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Does insurance cover the new COVID vaccine? The vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program. The 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients. \u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d Where can I get the new COVID vaccine? Visit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829. Do I still need a COVID vaccination card? If you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones. The CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination.

    "Document": "New COVID vaccines are here. What to know about latest shots in wake of nation\u2019s biggest summer surge\nOn the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers.\nBack in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early.\nManufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use.\nIn considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants.\n\u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d\nWho can get a new COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children:\nAdults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults.\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses.\nI recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine?\nYes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months.\nHowever, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area.\nI just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one?\nFor people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician.\nIf you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated.\nAre the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same?\nBoth use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them.\nComirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nSpikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nAll new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine?\nWhile the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift.\n\u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d\nTaking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says.

Back in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early. Manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use. In considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants. \u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d Who can get a new COVID vaccine? The CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children: Adults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults. People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses. I recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine? Yes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months. However, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area. I just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one? For people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician. If you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated. Are the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same? Both use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them. Comirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA. Spikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA. All new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. What\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine? While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift. \u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d Taking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2. I got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine? Yes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter. In the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d Hopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity. \u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19. \u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d Can you get COVID from the vaccine? No. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains. \u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d Because younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body. Ben-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d Can I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time? Yes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d Can I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated? Yes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Does insurance cover the new COVID vaccine? The vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program. The 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients. \u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d Where can I get the new COVID vaccine? Visit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829. Do I still need a COVID vaccination card? If you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones. The CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.

The market provides the value (in USD million) for the above-mentioned segments.\n\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Analysis\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is expected to register a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period (2021 to 2026).\nThe COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on people with hypertension. Also, due to lockdown and other restrictions imposed by governements to curb the spread of the infection from the Covid-19 virus, the lifestyle of patients with hypertension was severely impacted. As per the study titled \"COVID-19 in Patients with Hypertension\" published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology in July 2021, hypertension individuals who have COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality that is at least two times higher; nevertheless, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors that have been offer protection for this subgroup of patients which in turn expected to boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nOne of the leading factors responsible for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market is the rising prevalence of hypertension among people around the world. The major known causes of hypertension are kidney diseases, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and other cardiovascular diseases due to which the prevalence of hypertension has been observed a significant rise over the past few years. Also, some drugs can induce hypertension in patients with other diseases or disorders which in turn is expected to promote the growth of the studied market. As per the updated May 2021 data from the World Health Organization, about 1.13 billion people around the world have hypertension, of which two-third are living in low- and middle-income countries. In the report published in June 2020 titled 'A Global View on Prevalence of Hypertension and Human Development Index' to determine the relationship between the prevalence of hypertension and human development index (HDI) concluded that the prevalence of hypertension ranged from 35% to 41% among 182 countries around the world. Thus, the rising prevalence of hypertension is expected to drive the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nCertain other factors that will boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market include growing initiatives by private and government organizations and rising awareness about hypertension around the around. For instance, in May 2022, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals conclude the hypertension awareness symbol backed by the Association of Physicians of India (API) and Hypertension Society of India (HIS). Additionally, in May 2022, Namya Smile Foundation (NSF) organized an awareness campaign in India related to hypertension among people. The organization conducted a camp and checked the blood pressure and made them aware of various aspects of high blood pressure.\nWhereas factors such as expiration of patent of multiple major drugs along with side effects associated with the hypertension treatment and rise in the availability of other non-pharmacological based therapy will restrict the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market. For Instance, In December 2021, AbbVie, the parent company of Allergan, lost the patent of its anti-hypertensive drug, Bystolic (Nebivolol). Nebivolol is a beta blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Additionally, market participants frequently introduce new products and use a variety of growth tactics in their particular segments, which is likely to spur market expansion. For Instance, in December 2021, Dr Reddy's Laboratories has launched Valsartan tablets, used for treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, in the United States market. The Valsartan tablet is the generic therapeutic equivalent of Diovan, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Similarly, in November 2021, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. reported that Novartis Pharma K.K. (Novartis Pharma) has obtained approval in Japan for ENTREST 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets (generic name: sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate) for the new indication of hypertension. This approval is Japan's first of an ARNI for the indication of hypertension.\nThus, all aforementioned factors expected to boost the market growth over the forecast period, However, multiple major drug patent expiration expected to hamper the market growth.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Trends\n\n This section covers the major market trends shaping the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market according to our research experts: \n\nDiuretics Therapeutics Class is Expected to Hold a Significant Market Share in the Forecast Period\n\nDiuretics help in reducing the sodium and water from the body by inducing kidneys to release more sodium into the urine which leads to lower blood pressure as fluid flowing through the body is decreases. Diuretics are the preferred class of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of hypertension over others mainly because of their high efficacy, low cost, and low side effects as compared to other available therapeutic classes in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nDiuretics are of three types - thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics, from which thiazide diuretics are the cornerstone of treatment for hypertension in most patients around the world. For instance, as per the research article published in July 2022, titled 'Loop Diuretics', Loop diuretics have received FDA approval to be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensives to treat hypertension. However, first-line therapy does not consist solely of loop diuretics. Loop diuretics can be used to address fluid overload conditions and alternative hypertension therapy. Moreover, according to the study titled \"Thiazide diuretics alone or in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic on blood pressure-lowering in patients with primary hypertension: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis\" published in the BMC Open Journal in February 2022, Thiazides have a proven track record of lowering blood pressure, have a good safety record, and are inexpensive. This makes them a popular choice for pharmaceutical treatment. Hydrochlorothiazide has less antihypertensive effectiveness than chlorthalidone and indapamide. Thus,m due to above benefits of the diuretics in the management of hypertension is anticipated to boost the segmrent growth over the forecast period.\nTherefore, owing to the above-mentioned factors, the diuretics therapeutics class is expected to have highest growth as compared to others with the rise in the prevalence of hypertension cases around the world.\n\nNorth America is Expected to Dominate the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market Over the Forecast Period\n\nNorth America holds a major share in the anti-hypertensive drugs market and is expected to show a similar trend over the forecast period mainly due to the high prevalence of hypertension and diseases causing hypertension in the region. Additionally, the demand for prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, identifying people predisposed to the disease, presence of technically advanced healthcare infrastructure, and management of the prognosis of the disease are some of the key market drivers of the North American anti-hypertension market.\nIn North America, the United States will hold the largest market in anti-hypertensive drugs market in the region. In the United States, the rising prevalence of hypertension is the major reason for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drug market. As per the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention In July 2022, over half of adults (47 percent, or 116 million) have hypertension. Thus, the growing burden of hypertension in the United States is expected to rise in the demand anti-hypertensive drug thereby boost the market growth.\nThe other factors such as increasing awareness among the people about hypertension in the region. For instance, in November 2021, New public service announcements (PSAs) were released by the American Heart Association (AHA), American Medical Association (AMA), HHS Office of Minority Health (OMH), Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA), and the Ad Council to encourage people to take charge of their health by self-monitoring their blood pressure and talking with a healthcare provider about their numbers.\nAdditionally, various strategies adopted by the key market players such as product launches and merger and acquisistion supports the market growth. In April 2021, United Therapeutics Corporation announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration approved its drug for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease, known as Tyvaso (Treprostinil).\nThus, the North America is expected to hold major market share in the anti-hypertensive market.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Industry Overview\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is highly competitive due to the presence of a number of pharmaceutical companies. Companies such as AstraZeneca PLC, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, Johnson & Johnson Ltd, Lupin Limited, Merck KGaA ., Novartis AG, among others, hold a substantial market share in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Leaders\n\nPfizer Inc.\nC.H.

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

    "Summarized_Document": "Holding too much inventory ties up capital and increases carrying costs, while not enough stock can lead to slow order fulfillment and lost revenue. The reorder point (ROP) is a technique in supply chain management to balance these issues by determining the minimum number of units needed in stock to meet sales orders or production targets. When inventory falls below this point, a new purchase order is triggered. Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times. An effective reorder point helps fulfill orders quickly, protect margins, and keep customers satisfied.",

Authored by USApple Vice President of Insights and Analytics, Chris Gerlach, the report takes an in-depth look at the trends and forces \u2013 from political headwinds to weather events \u2013 that shape the U.S. apple industry.\n*The Outlook Report is based on recently released United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates. After the presentation of those numbers, USApple members met in-person to discuss current growing conditions to formulate a more up-to-date production estimate. The final USApple 2024/25 crop year forecast is an adjustment of the USDA numbers based on those conversations.\nU.S. Production\nAccording to USApple\u2019s analysis, total U.S. apple production for the 2024/25 crop year (CY) will be 259,517,252 bushels. This represents a 10.1% decrease compared to last year\u2019s final production figure.\n\u201cGrowers from across the U.S. are reporting the crop quality is excellent,\u201d said Gerlach.\nThese figures are more comprehensive than USDA data, which only look at the top seven apple-producing states. USApple analyzes the production from states outside of the top seven and adds that back into USDA\u2019s figure. It also incorporates feedback from growers based on what they\u2019re seeing in the field every day.\n\u201cDespite various challenges, the resilience and dedication of our growers have led to another promising year for apple production,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cThe data we\u2019ve gathered not only highlights the strength of our industry, but also underscores the importance of innovation and adaptability in ensuring a bountiful harvest.\u201d\nVarietal Mix\nAt the varietal level, Gala is expected to retain the top spot with more than 48 million bushels produced, accounting for around 17% of the U.S. apple market. After Gala, rounding out the top five are Red Delicious (12.3%), Granny Smith (10%), Honeycrisp (9.8%) and Fuji (9.4%).\nIn general, the varieties on the rise include Honeycrisp, Pink Lady/Cripps Pink and Cosmic Crisp\u00ae. Fuji, Rome and \u201cother\u201d varieties have remained relatively consistent compared to 2019/20 production volumes. Varieties on the decline include Gala and Red Delicious.\n\u201cWe still see strong Honeycrisp production, but it\u2019s tempered this year,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cWith volumes aligning more closely with Gala and Red Delicious, we may see production levels stabilize rather than increase dramatically in the future.\u201d\nTrade\nAccording to USDA trade data, fresh apple exports totaled 46.4 million bushels in the 2023/24 CY (July to June). This is around 14 million bushels higher than 2022/23 export levels \u2013 an astonishing 44% year-over-year increase.\nDuring the same period, fresh apple imports dropped by around one million bushels, a 15% decline. The joint effects of increasing exports and decreasing imports caused the already net positive fresh apple trade balance to grow to more than 42 million bushels.\nThe surge in fresh apple exports is largely attributed to the abundant domestic supply, competitive pricing abroad, and favorable positive trade policies.\n\u201cThanks to the removal of previously imposed tariffs on our apples, exports to India are up nearly 4,000% year over year. We are optimistic that this critical market will continue to grow in volume and value,\u201d said Gerlach.\nGlobal ProductionAccording to United Nations (UN) data, worldwide apple production surpassed 5 billion bushels for the first time in 2022 (the latest available datapoint). In 2022, China alone was responsible for producing 2.5 billion bushels, around half of the world\u2019s total supply. In 2021, Turkey overtook the U.S. to become the world\u2019s second largest apple producer and maintained that spot in 2022, even widening the gap between us (with 253 million bushels, 5% of world production). The U.S., in the third spot, was credited with 232 million bushels and 4.6% of world production.

    "Document": "2024 Manufacturing Outlook for Sourcing & Supply Chain Resiliency\nKey Takeaways:\nThe Full Article:\nResilience remains a top priority for manufacturers, who continue to increase their operational visibility and transparency and become more agile to proactively address potential supply chain disruptions. To remain competitive in 2024, digital transformation solutions enabling organizations to achieve supply chain resiliency, profitability, and sustainability goals are crucial.\nAccording to KPMG, \u201csmart\u201d supply chain management and sourcing initiatives will make waves powered by advanced technologies such as automation, data analytics, digital twins, and more.\nThis article explores six main priorities that manufacturers are navigating to stay ahead of the competition in 2024:\n1. Increase Supply Chain Speed and Performance with Digitalization\nDigital transformation (DX) can significantly benefit manufacturing sourcing and procurement teams. A growing body of work shows that successful DX initiatives require effective planning and a detailed implementation plan that addresses new technology, employee training, and operational guidelines (workflows) to drive value.\nA 10-year Deloitte study of publicly traded companies worldwide finds that DX tied to an effective strategy and a comprehensive deployment and onboarding process can yield a market capitalization increase of up to 5%. By contrast, DX programs executed without the same level of rigor can cause value erosion.\nHere are two areas of strategic sourcing to consider enhancing:\nI) Streamline Supplier Communications and Revisit Strategic Sourcing Operations\nManufacturers and suppliers want to streamline their sourcing and procurement processes in the current business landscape. A survey conducted by IndustryWeek in collaboration with aPriori found that 70% of respondents want to accelerate the quoting process, and 79% prefer a 24-hour to two-week completion window.\nDigital tools like aPriori provide a centralized solution for real-time supplier collaboration and information exchange. These automated platforms eliminate the need for traditional request for quotation (RFQ) processes that are time-consuming and prone to delays.\nInstead, today\u2019s digital technologies deliver \u201cZero RFQ\u201d or automated procurement capabilities that enable manufacturing companies to:\nII) Accelerate the Product Design and Production Process\nDigital automation-driven solutions help innovators bring together teams spread across different departments. These teams can combine their efforts on a single solution covering design, manufacturing, and sourcing operations.\nWith access to real-time data and visibility into the design and production process, sourcing professionals can get involved early in product development. This helps them identify potential component shortages and recommend design alternatives and changes to an existing bill of materials (BOM). This way, manufacturing companies can avoid supply chain risks and mitigate any negative impacts that may emerge.\naPriori\u2019s real-time co-working application, aP Workspace, expedites task management and provides data audibility for decision-making. Users can access links to the application from their product lifecycle management (PLM) systems to gain actionable insights. These capabilities allow teams to collaborate seamlessly and communicate effectively, achieving their profitability and sustainability goals without reinventing existing business processes.\n2. Build a Solid Foundation for Artificial Intelligence\nManufacturers continue to make digital investments to automate processes, manage data, strengthen internal resources, and facilitate cross-functional collaboration. The result is faster and more informed business decisions for forward-thinking manufacturers.\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most alluring digital tools. S&P\u2019s 2024 Supply Chain Outlook states, \u201cWhile AI cannot prevent supply chain disruptions, if deployed in the correct manner, it could provide predictive probabilities of future disruptions.\u201d\nAI cannot work in a vacuum: It needs robust, accurate data to analyze and address specific manufacturing challenges. But as the MIT Sloan Management Review points out, \u201cManufacturing data is often localized or specific to a particular industry domain or a company\u2019s operations. As a result, there isn\u2019t a lot of relevant data available for building reliable AI models.\u201d\nAdditionally, product design, sourcing, and manufacturing data often reside in individual departments (either in systems that are not integrated or personalized spreadsheets filled with supplier information that is not easily accessible).\nCentralizing and providing access to data across the product development life cycle is central to making data-driven insights (with or without AI). Adding weight, carbon emissions, and other information to a PLM system \u2013 which already stores a bill of materials (BOM) \u2013 makes it easier for product development and sourcing teams to make decisions confidently and anticipate potential issues throughout the development process.\nManufacturers can also use automated analysis solutions like aPriori\u2019s aP Generate, which integrates with the PLM to centralize critical manufacturing information. aP Generate links to aP Design and aP Workspace in the PLM, enabling users to take further steps or ask questions for up-to-date decision-making.\nSome manufacturers are already gaining end-to-end insights using digital twins to connect product design, manufacturing processes, and individual factory capabilities. This data-driven insight is powerful on its own. And it can serve as part of a digital platform that AI can use to make additional analysis quickly.\nPrioritizing data quality is key to unlocking the full potential of AI in the manufacturing industry. With data-driven insights, manufacturers can evaluate alternatives, improve scenario planning operations, transform business models, and enhance supply chain resiliency.\n3. De-Risk Supply Chains and Evaluate Reshoring\nMaintaining a diverse supplier base and reducing overreliance on specific supplier locations mitigates risks associated with geopolitical issues, natural disasters, and other unprecedented events like the 2020 pandemic. Diversified supply chains improve resilience and ensure business continuity in today\u2019s dynamic global environment.\nOne tool that can help manufacturers with this is aPriori\u2019s Regional Data Libraries (RDLs). These digital libraries provide real-world and timely variable material and supplier production costs across 87 global regions. By utilizing this feature, innovators can assess manufacturing alternatives effectively, consider the impact of region-specific tariffs, and avoid an overreliance on specific regions with potential risks. This often leads to significant cost savings and reduced lead times.\nManufacturers can also consider the benefits of reshoring specific manufacturing operations. This can lead to a reduction in shipping costs and taking advantage of valuable tax credits. For instance, automotive manufacturers can use reshoring to redirect the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain to the U.S. This helps eliminate their dependency on semiconductors produced in China and capitalize on a $7,500 tax credit.\nIn its annual Reshoring Index report, the global consulting firm Kearney provides further insight into U.S. reshoring initiatives. Its findings include:\nRead our insights on why reshoring U.S. manufacturing could be right for you.\n4. Offset Labor Shortages via Automation\nAccording to Deloitte\u2019s 2024 Manufacturing Industry Outlook survey, nearly 80% of respondents consider labor market shortages a critical threat. To address this challenge, approximately 50% of manufacturing executives equip their production workforce with advanced digital technologies and flexible schedules. This approach aims to:\nLeading innovators like Woodward leverage aPriori\u2019s automation, simulation capabilities, and actionable insights to counteract the shortage of skilled workers. By employing aPriori, the company can achieve more with fewer resources, such as:\n5. Capitalize on Economic Tailwinds to Accelerate U.S. Manufacturing Growth\nProduct innovators can take advantage of positive economic factors supporting business growth in the upcoming year. These economic trends include:\nI) Federal Investments in Manufacturing Innovation\nThe Biden administration has introduced new measures to strengthen North America\u2019s supply chains and reduce costs. One of the measures implemented is the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act, which aims to reduce America\u2019s reliance on foreign-produced chips.\nThis federal initiative includes $231 billion to build semiconductor factories in the U.S. The program also includes a 25% tax credit for capital investments in semiconductor production to spur innovation and manufacturing in this area.\nAlongside the U.S. CHIPS initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aims to propel clean energy and sustainable manufacturing domestically. The IRA provides more than $1.7 billion in funding and additional tax credits to incentivize manufacturers. This initiative primarily targets consumers, empowering them to purchase green products like EVs.\nCompanies across multiple industries can take advantage of the incentives offered by federal programs. For instance, the building and construction industry can capitalize on these incentives by developing energy-efficient buildings with sustainable insulation, lighting, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Similarly, federal investments to advance the clean energy sector range from EV production in the automotive industry to zero-emissions battery materials.\n6. Use the Green Supply Chain as a Competitive Advantage\nProduct manufacturers increasingly recognize the growing demand from customers and stakeholders for sustainable, green innovations. Manufacturers can achieve a net-zero future by selecting the appropriate raw materials and production processes to decarbonize their product portfolios.\nAcross the globe, several regulations have been implemented to increase sustainable manufacturing and sourcing operations. These measures include:\nThe financial impact of sustainability requires manufacturers to assign a cost to carbon as they design new products and initiate value engineering on older products. Internal Carbon Pricing (ICP) is an approach that manufacturers and other organizations use internally to assign a cost for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted. This enables manufacturing and sourcing teams to understand the cost of carbon and to compare it to traditional manufacturing costs (e.g., material, labor, and manufacturing overhead costs).\nWith an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison, sourcing teams can easily evaluate carbon and other manufacturing costs. Then, they can select the suppliers that will enable them to reach their key performance indicators for cost, CO2e, and other goals.\nGain the Ability to Navigate Global Supply Chain Uncertainty\nThe ongoing process of digital transformation shapes the 2024 manufacturing outlook. This encompasses trends like Generative AI, automation, and digital twin technologies for supply chain resiliency. Advanced digital solutions like aPriori provide real-time advantages, from accelerating product design to counteracting critical labor market shortages.\nIn addition to investing in digital technologies, economic tailwinds, fueled by initiatives like the CHIPS Act, provide sustainable growth opportunities and promote reshoring.\nAt its core, this post highlights the various obstacles, opportunities, and trends that manufacturing companies can expect to face in the upcoming year.\nGet the State of Procurement Report\nSubscribe to the aPriori Blog!\nListen to Our Most Popular Manufacturing Podcasts of 2023\n13 Must-Read Manufacturing Sourcing & Procurement Posts of 2023\nRead Our 7 Best Product Sustainability and Innovation Posts of 2023\nWhat Is Design to Cost?

Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix due to growth of premium products.\nGrooming segment organic sales increased seven percent versus year ago driven by increased pricing primarily in Latin America and volume growth from innovation.\nHealth Care segment organic sales increased four percent versus year ago. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to premium product mix and volume growth in North America and Europe. Personal Health Care organic sales were unchanged as growth due to pricing and volume increases were offset by unfavorable mix due to lower incidence of cough and cold.\nFabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased two percent versus year ago. Fabric Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth driven by North America and Europe was offset by lower pricing due to increased promotional spending. Home Care organic sales increased high single digits due to volume growth from innovation and favorable product mix.\nBaby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales declined one percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines from share losses, partially offset by premium product mix. Feminine Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix. Family Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27 for the quarter, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased by two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS were up six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nReported gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points versus year ago. Core gross margin for the quarter increased 140 basis points versus year ago, 180 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 210 basis points of productivity savings, 100 basis points of lower commodity costs and 40 basis points of pricing benefit. These were partially offset by 130 basis points of unfavorable product mix and 40 basis points of product/package reinvestments and other impacts.\nReported selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 260 basis points versus the prior year. Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points versus year ago and 240 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 300 basis points of marketing reinvestments and 30 basis points of wage inflation and overhead investments, partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of net sales growth leverage and other impacts.\nReported operating margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points due primarily to higher restructuring charges. Excluding 40 basis points of non-core restructuring charges, core operating margin for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus the prior year, 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Core operating margin included gross productivity savings of 250 basis points.\nLimited Market Portfolio Restructuring\nIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company said that it expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nIn the October-December 2023 quarter of the fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nThe impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.\nFiscal Year 2025 Guidance\nP&G expects fiscal year 2025 all-in sales growth in the range of two to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of three to five percent.\nP&G expects fiscal 2025 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 10% to 12% versus fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS of $6.02. P&G expects its fiscal 2025 core net earnings per share growth in the range of five to seven percent versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This outlook equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.98, or an increase of 6%.\nThe Company said its outlook estimates a net headwind of around $500 million after-tax from unfavorable commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The net headwind equates to a $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025, or a three percentage drag on core EPS growth.\nIn addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from minor brand divestitures and tax impacts that are unlikely to repeat to the same extent in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS.\nThe Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nP&G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% in fiscal 2025.\nCapital spending is estimated to be in the range of four to five percent of fiscal 2025 net sales.\nP&G said it expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nThe Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:\nIncremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.\nIntangible asset impairment: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nWe do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.\nOrganic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nCore EPS and Currency-neutral EPS: Core net earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance over time.\nCore gross margin and Currency-neutral Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's Core gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nCore selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of sales and Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales: Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's Core selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.\nCore operating margin and Currency-neutral Core operating margin: Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's Core operating margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nAdjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G\u2019s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nTHE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nAmounts in millions except per share amounts\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\n\u00a0\nIncremental\nRestructuring\n\u00a0\nIntangible\nImpairment\n\u00a0\nCore\n(Non-GAAP)\n\u00a0\nAs Reported\n(GAAP) (1)\nCost of products sold\n$\n10,348\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n(45\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,303\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,613\n\u00a0\nGross profit\n\u00a0\n10,183\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n10,229\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9,940\n\u00a0\nGross margin\n\u00a0\n49.6\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n49.8\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n48.4\n%\nCurrency impact to Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n50.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\u00a0\n6,299\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(28\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6,271\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5,778\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n30.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(0.2\n)%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n28.1\n%\nCurrency impact to Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating income\n\u00a0\n3,884\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n73\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,958\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4,162\n\u00a0\nOperating margin\n\u00a0\n18.9\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.3\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n20.3\n%\nCurrency impact to Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOther non-operating income, net\n\u00a0\n98\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n248\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n346\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n195\n\u00a0\nIncome taxes\n\u00a0\n726\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(6\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n720\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n841\n\u00a0\nNet earnings attributable to P&G\n\u00a0\n3,137\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n327\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,464\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,384\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted net earnings per common share (2)\n$\n1.27\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n0.13\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.40\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.37\n\u00a0\nCurrency impact to Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n1.45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n\u00a0\n2,472.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2,477.5\n\u00a0\nCommon shares outstanding -

    "Summarized_Document": "Procter & Gamble (P&G) reported its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results, highlighting strong performance despite economic and geopolitical challenges. For fiscal year 2024, net sales increased by 2% to $84.0 billion, and organic sales grew by 4%. Diluted EPS rose by 2% to $6.02, while core EPS increased by 12% to $6.59. The company generated $19.8 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $14 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, net sales remained flat at $20.5 billion, with organic sales up by 2%. Diluted EPS for the quarter decreased by 7% to $1.27, while core EPS increased by 2% to $1.40. P&G's fiscal year 2025 guidance anticipates 2-4% all-in sales growth and 3-5% organic sales growth. The company expects diluted EPS growth of 10-12% and core EPS growth of 5-7%. P&G also plans to pay around $10 billion in dividends and repurchase $6-7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025. The company faced challenges such as higher restructuring charges and an impairment charge on the Gillette intangible asset. Despite these, P&G remains committed to its integrated strategy focused on product superiority, productivity, and constructive disruption.",

(NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the second quarter 2024. \u201cDuring the second quarter, our business delivered net revenue growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth, remaining agile despite facing difficult net revenue growth comparisons versus the prior year, subdued category performance within North America convenient foods and the impacts associated with certain product recalls at Quaker Foods North America,\u201d said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.\nLaguarta continued, \u201cFor the balance of the year, we will further elevate and accelerate our productivity initiatives and make disciplined commercial investments in the marketplace to stimulate growth. These investments will focus on surgically providing optimal value propositions within certain portions of our North America convenient foods portfolio, amplifying our advertising and marketing initiatives and leveraging our go-to-market distribution capabilities to enable more precise marketplace execution. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4 percent) and have a high degree of confidence in delivering at least 8 percent core constant currency EPS growth for full-year 2024.\u201d 1 Please refer to the Glossary for the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, including \u201cOrganic revenue growth,\u201d \u201cCore\u201d and \u201cConstant currency,\u201d and to \u201cGuidance and Outlook\u201d for additional information regarding PepsiCo\u2019s full-year 2024 financial guidance.

For 2024, the Company now expects: \u2022 Approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4%). In addition, the Company continues to expect: \u2022 At least 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS; \u2022 A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; \u2022 Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8.2 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion; and \u2022 An approximate 1-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.\nThis assumption and the guidance above imply 2024 core EPS of at least $8.15, a 7 percent increase compared to 2023 core EPS of $7.62.\nPrepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast At approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will post prepared management remarks (in pdf format) of its second quarter 2024 results and business update, including its outlook for 2024, at www.pepsico.com/investors. At 8:15 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will host a live question and answer session with investors and financial analysts.

5 Non-GAAP Measures In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nImpairment and other charges/credits We recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in Tropicana Brands Group. We also recognized adjustments to charges recorded in prior years from changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.\nA - 6 Product recall-related impact We recognized property, plant and equipment and inventory write-offs, product returns, employee severance costs, customer and consumer-related costs and other costs in our Quaker Foods North America division associated with a previously announced voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 2024 guidance Our 2024 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2024 core effective tax rate guidance and our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges and other items noted above. Our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2024 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2024 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2024 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2024 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2024 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2024 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\nA - 7 PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information Organic Revenue Growth Rates 12 and 24 Weeks Ended June 15, 2024 (unaudited) 12 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America (0.5) % \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 % (4) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (18) % \u2014 \u2014 (18) % (17) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3.5) 5 Latin America 7 % (5) \u2014 2 % (5) 6 Europe 2.5 % 5 \u2014 7 % 2 5 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 11 (1) 12 % 1 11 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (2) % 3 \u2014 1 % \u2014 1.5 Total 1 % 1 \u2014 2 % (3) 5 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America 0.5 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (21) % \u2014 \u2014 (21) % (20) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (4) 5 Latin America 10 % (6) \u2014 4 % (3) 7 Europe 3 % 5.5 \u2014 8 % 2 6 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 8 \u2014 10 % 2 7 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region 2 % 4 \u2014 6 % 5 0.5 Total 1.5 % 1 \u2014 2 % (2) 5 (a) A financial measure that is not in accordance with GAAP.

(NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the second quarter 2024. \u201cDuring the second quarter, our business delivered net revenue growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth, remaining agile despite facing difficult net revenue growth comparisons versus the prior year, subdued category performance within North America convenient foods and the impacts associated with certain product recalls at Quaker Foods North America,\u201d said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.\nLaguarta continued, \u201cFor the balance of the year, we will further elevate and accelerate our productivity initiatives and make disciplined commercial investments in the marketplace to stimulate growth. These investments will focus on surgically providing optimal value propositions within certain portions of our North America convenient foods portfolio, amplifying our advertising and marketing initiatives and leveraging our go-to-market distribution capabilities to enable more precise marketplace execution. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4 percent) and have a high degree of confidence in delivering at least 8 percent core constant currency EPS growth for full-year 2024.\u201d 1 Please refer to the Glossary for the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, including \u201cOrganic revenue growth,\u201d \u201cCore\u201d and \u201cConstant currency,\u201d and to \u201cGuidance and Outlook\u201d for additional information regarding PepsiCo\u2019s full-year 2024 financial guidance.

For 2024, the Company now expects: \u2022 Approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4%). In addition, the Company continues to expect: \u2022 At least 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS; \u2022 A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; \u2022 Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8.2 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion; and \u2022 An approximate 1-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.\nThis assumption and the guidance above imply 2024 core EPS of at least $8.15, a 7 percent increase compared to 2023 core EPS of $7.62.\nPrepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast At approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will post prepared management remarks (in pdf format) of its second quarter 2024 results and business update, including its outlook for 2024, at www.pepsico.com/investors. At 8:15 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will host a live question and answer session with investors and financial analysts.

5 Non-GAAP Measures In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nImpairment and other charges/credits We recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in Tropicana Brands Group. We also recognized adjustments to charges recorded in prior years from changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.\nA - 6 Product recall-related impact We recognized property, plant and equipment and inventory write-offs, product returns, employee severance costs, customer and consumer-related costs and other costs in our Quaker Foods North America division associated with a previously announced voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 2024 guidance Our 2024 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2024 core effective tax rate guidance and our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges and other items noted above. Our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2024 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2024 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2024 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2024 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2024 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2024 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.

    "Document": "Personal Care Industry Size & Share Analysis - Growth Trends & Forecasts (2023 - 2028)\nThe Report Covers Global Beauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends and is segmented by Product Type (Personal Care Products and Cosmetics/Make-up Products); by Distribution Channel (Specialist Retail Stores, Supermarkets/Hypermarkets, Convenience Stores, Pharmacies/Drug Stores, Online Retail Channels, and Other Distribution Channel); by Category (Mass Products and Premium Products); and by Geography (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, South America, and Middle-East and Africa). The report offers market size and values in (USD Billion) during the forecasted years for the above segments.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Analysis\nThe Beauty and Personal Care Products Market size is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 4.64% over the next five years.\nMillennials are increasingly using beauty products like color cosmetics as part of their regular grooming routines. For instance, as of 2021, according to financial comparison service provider Mozo, the average Australian woman spent approximately USD 3,600 on beauty and personal care products yearly. The simple accessibility of these cosmetic items through various sales channels, with the increased emphasis on personal grooming, aided the sales value. Furthermore, the emergence of cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic components helped the market expansion. With the rising awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products, consumers are inclined toward organic personal care products. It is expected to drive market growth during the study period. Besides this, companies are capitalizing on consumers' demands to expand their share and consumer base in the market. For instance, in February 2022, a United Kingdom-based fashion company, Boohoo, launched a vegan beauty range of more than 50 products. Boohoo Beauty's cosmetics line includes highlighter sticks, blush, setting sprays, cosmetic palettes, and others available exclusively.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends\nInclination toward Natural/Organic Formulations\nThe growing concerns regarding the side effects of chemicals in personal care products, leading to skin irritation, allergies, and dullness, fueled the demand for natural and organic skincare products. Prolonged use of synthetic cosmetics may cause various health issues, such as irritation, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity. However, cosmetic products made of organic ingredients, such as plant extracts and natural oils, do not harm the skin. Natural skincare and cosmetic products that are free from chemicals and transparent about the content are preferred by consumers. This factor resulted in a shift in preference from synthetic skincare products to organic products among consumers.\nTo capitalize on this growing interest, manufacturers are revamping and expanding their product offerings by introducing a wide range of organic skincare products. These products contain plant-based, clean-label ingredients with organic, vegan, natural, chemical-free, and cruelty-free claims. For instance, in April 2022, Shiseido revealed a new skincare brand, Ul\u00e9. It sources pesticide-free botanicals from local vertical farms. The dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits of natural skincare led consumers to seek eco-friendly, sustainable, natural skincare products that offer greater product ingredient transparency. Furthermore, the growing trend of organic concepts through online stores for bio-cosmetic products is expected to boost the growth of the natural and organic beauty and personal care products market.\nAsia-Pacific Emerges as the Fastest-growing Region\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries like China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam present considerable growth opportunities for the market players. It is primarily due to the growing demand for color cosmetics, as many people unleash the potential of cosmetics in their daily makeup routine. Hence, the significant players are intensely embarking on product innovation and mergers and acquisitions as their prime strategy to consolidate the market. For instance, in April 2023, Personal care and beauty brand The Body Shop launched its 'activist' product range in the Indian market. The new line strengthens the brand's sustainable commitment in the country with a selection of skin products and color cosmetics.\nFurthermore, growing awareness regarding cosmetics products, such as facial makeup, hairstyling, and coloring products, with increasing demand for clean labels and natural ingredients, is expected to drive the market shortly. The need for multifunctional products is driving innovation as price-conscious consumers are opting for products that provide hydration and skin protection. The trend of social media influencers showcasing their beauty regimens increased over the past few years. Thus, both local and international beauty companies are turning to influencers to increase their brand awareness and reach potential consumers. For instance, in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, the Honest Company, a clean lifestyle company founded by Jessica Alba, launched its business in China. To capitalize on the relatively small but rising demand for sanitary beauty products, the digitally native company created a flagship store on Tmall Global, Alibaba Group's cross-border e-commerce platform. Chinese shoppers can purchase skin care and color cosmetics from Honest's brand, Honest Beauty. Shoppers on Tmall Global can select from various stock-keeping units, including its Extreme Length Mascara + Lash Primer and Hydrogel Cream, a face cream enriched with hyaluronic acid.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Industry Overview\nThe global beauty and personal care market is highly competitive, with a strong presence of regional and international players in the market like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. Demand is mainly driven by more adaptation toward skincare routines and consumer awareness about brand know-how. The companies improved the quality and product innovation regarding ingredients, functionality, and packaging. The key players are embarking on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation as their key strategies to achieve consolidation and optimize offerings. Moreover, these players merge with local players to gain dominance in the local market.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Leaders\nThe Procter & Gamble Company\nL'Oreal SA\nUnilever PLC\nColgate-Palmolive Company\nThe Estee Lauder Companies\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market News\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. For the full year, net revenues grew 6% to $45.8 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 12%, driven by 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. For both the quarter and the full year, organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across all operating segments.\n- Operating margin:\u00a0For the quarter, operating margin was 21.0% versus 20.5% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 23.1% versus 22.7% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin was 24.7% versus 25.4% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 29.1% versus 28.7% in the prior year. Operating margin performance included items impacting comparability and currency headwinds. For both the quarter and full year, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds.\n- Earnings per share:\u00a0For the quarter, EPS declined 2% to $0.46, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 10% to $0.49. EPS performance included the impact of a 14-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 13-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS grew 13% to $2.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 8% to $2.69. EPS performance included the impact of an 8-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 7-point currency headwind.\n- Market share:\u00a0For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.\n- Cash flow:\u00a0Cash flow from operations was $11.6 billion for the full year, an increase of $581 million versus the prior year, driven by strong business performance and working capital initiatives, partially offset by a transition tax payment and currency headwinds. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.7 billion for the full year, an increase of $213 million versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Connecting with consumers through experiences and digital engagement: The company continues to leverage its marketing transformation to build globally scaled marketing platforms tailored to local consumers. In the fourth quarter, \u201cThe World Needs More Santas\u201d campaign was executed in over 80 markets, continuing the company\u2019s rich history of celebrating the holidays. The company leveraged the success of its first AI-based platform, \u201cCreate Real Magic\u201d, by inviting consumers to create sharable, digital greeting cards featuring iconic brand assets such as cherished depictions of Santa Claus and the Coca\u2011Cola polar bear. Local initiatives generated buzz and excitement, such as the Coca\u2011Cola Caravan Truck Tour, which travelled throughout nearly 60 countries around the world making over a thousand stops and meeting over 16 million consumers to share in the magic. In total, the holiday campaign experiences garnered approximately 9 billion impressions on social media. By combining the company\u2019s global scale with local relevancy, the holiday activation contributed to Trademark Coca\u2011Cola\u00ae volume and value share gains as well as unit case volume and transactions growth for both the quarter and for the full year.\n-\u00a0Building a system that is increasingly positioned for sustainable long-term growth: Since the start of 2023, the company completed the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations in Vietnam to a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Limited (Swire), completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Pakistan to Coca\u2011Cola \u0130\u00e7ecek and completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Indonesia to Coca\u2011Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). More recently, the company completed the refranchising of a portion of its company-owned bottling operations in India to existing franchise bottlers and received regulatory approval to sell its bottling operations in the Philippines to CCEP and Aboitiz Equity Ventures, which is expected to close towards the end of February 2024. Additionally, the company recently completed the sale of its stake in the largest bottler in Thailand to Swire and existing shareholders of the bottler. Our franchise business model has enabled the company to develop a strong global footprint with a local touch in markets around the world. The company continuously works to optimize the system with trusted, capable and motivated bottling partners allowing it to focus on building and growing consumer-loved brands.\n-\u00a0Delivering on our purpose by empowering people to drive growth: The company\u2019s strategy is centered around people, starting with the employees who are critical in bringing this strategy to life. In November, the company was ranked #1 on the 2023 American Opportunity Index, which assessed how effectively companies enable employees to progress in their careers in the United States. Around the world, the company provides thousands of jobs and is invested in the long-term success of its employees. Over the year, the company enhanced its learning and related technologies, making strides towards nurturing a more innovative and informed workforce. The company\u2019s 2023 Culture & Engagement Survey results underscore the strong levels of employee pride and growth opportunities with a strong number of respondents saying they are proud to work at The Coca\u2011Cola Company and see good opportunities to learn and grow in their roles.\nOperating Review \u2013 Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\nOperating Review \u2013 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIn addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following:\n- Unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter.

The company has increased its dividend in each of the last 61 years.\n-\u00a0M&A initiatives: In 2023, the company did not make any significant acquisitions. The company continues to evaluate inorganic growth opportunities through brands and capabilities. In 2023, with respect to divestitures, the company made progress towards refranchising company-owned bottling operations.\n-\u00a0Share repurchases: In 2023, the company issued $0.5 billion of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchased $2.3 billion of shares. Consequently, net share repurchases (non-GAAP) were $1.7 billion. The company\u2019s remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $6 billion.\nOutlook\nThe 2024 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2024 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2024 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2024 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2024; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2024; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s full-year 2024 reported financial results.\nThe company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 6% to 7%.\nFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company\u2019s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.2%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail.\nGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 10% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 4% to 5%, versus $2.69 in 2023.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 4% to 5% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include an approximate 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe first quarter has one less day compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nNotes\n- All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.\n- All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales in the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. \u201cUnit case\u201d means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. \u201cUnit case volume\u201d means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.\n- \u201cConcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\n- \u201cPrice/mix\u201d represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.\n- First quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2022, and fourth quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2022. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.\nConference Call\nThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2023 operating results today, Feb. 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company\u2019s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section.

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The restructuring expenses of $55 million in the quarter ($479 million Q4 YTD) include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.\nIn fiscal 2023, the company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The restructuring expenses of $84 million in the quarter ($319 million Q4 YTD) primarily includes inventory and instrument reserves related to the market and product exits.\nEuropean Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company\u2019s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.\nThe tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted earnings.\n4.2%\n13.3%\n7.3%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(2.5)%\n12.4%\n2.9%\n0.2\n(0.1)\n0.1\n-\n-\n-\n0.6\n(0.4)\n0.2\n4.0%\n13.4%\n7.2%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(3.1)%\n12.8%\n2.7%\n(4.5)\n(1.6)\n(7.2)\n(2.3)\n(1.9)\n(0.7)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.3\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n4.0%\n9.1%\n5.7%\n9.5%\n7.2%\n8.8%\n(3.0)%\n11.0%\n2.1%\nInnovative

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The restructuring expenses of $55 million in the quarter ($479 million Q4 YTD) include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.\nIn fiscal 2023, the company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The restructuring expenses of $84 million in the quarter ($319 million Q4 YTD) primarily includes inventory and instrument reserves related to the market and product exits.\nEuropean Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company\u2019s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.\nThe tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted earnings.\n4.2%\n13.3%\n7.3%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(2.5)%\n12.4%\n2.9%\n0.2\n(0.1)\n0.1\n-\n-\n-\n0.6\n(0.4)\n0.2\n4.0%\n13.4%\n7.2%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(3.1)%\n12.8%\n2.7%\n(4.5)\n(1.6)\n(7.2)\n(2.3)\n(1.9)\n(0.7)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.3\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n4.0%\n9.1%\n5.7%\n9.5%\n7.2%\n8.8%\n(3.0)%\n11.0%\n2.1%\nInnovative

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The restructuring expenses of $55 million in the quarter ($479 million Q4 YTD) include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.\nIn fiscal 2023, the company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The restructuring expenses of $84 million in the quarter ($319 million Q4 YTD) primarily includes inventory and instrument reserves related to the market and product exits.\nEuropean Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company\u2019s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.\nThe tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted earnings.\n4.2%\n13.3%\n7.3%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(2.5)%\n12.4%\n2.9%\n0.2\n(0.1)\n0.1\n-\n-\n-\n0.6\n(0.4)\n0.2\n4.0%\n13.4%\n7.2%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(3.1)%\n12.8%\n2.7%\n(4.5)\n(1.6)\n(7.2)\n(2.3)\n(1.9)\n(0.7)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.3\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n4.0%\n9.1%\n5.7%\n9.5%\n7.2%\n8.8%\n(3.0)%\n11.0%\n2.1%\nInnovative

Small businesses that use FedEx Ground Economy will see surcharges jump to $1.60 in Oct. 30 to Nov. 26 period, as well as through the Dec. 11 to Jan. 14 time frame, an increase from $1.50 in the comparable periods last year. The surcharges will escalate to $2.60 in the more hectic periods of the season, from Nov. 27 to Dec. 10, up from $2.50 in the comparable period last year.\n\n\tThe demand surcharges also apply to packages that are large, oversized or require additional handling via U.S. Ground and U.S. Express.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe \u201cadditional handling\u201d surcharges were increased to $6.95 from $6.55 per package, while oversize charges jumped from $68.75 to $73. Ground unauthorized package charges\u2014fees for packages that are so big that FedEx Ground has the discretion to refuse, return to the shipper or dispose of them\u2014are now $410, up from $385 in the year prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nFedEx is also implementing surcharges that target larger shippers\u2019 volume spikes during the holidays to mitigate strain on its network. Starting Oct. 30, enterprise-level customers shipping more than 20,000 residential and FedEx Ground Economy packages will be subject to the company\u2019s \u201cresidential delivery charge.\u201d\n\n\tThis charge can range from $1.35 to $6.35 per FedEx Ground package, and $2.40 to $7.40 per FedEx Express package. The amount depends on how much more the customer is shipping compared to their weekly average residential and FedEx Ground Economy volume from June 5 to July 2. FedEx calls that increase a shipper\u2019s \u201cpeaking factor.\u201d\n\n\tFedEx will calculate the peaking factor each week from Oct. 9-15 to Dec. 18-24, with a week\u2019s charge being applied three weeks later. This means that a customer that ships 20 percent more volume the week starting Nov. 6 than they did from June 5 to July 2 will see an added $1.35 charge for each applicable FedEx Ground package shipped the week starting Nov. 27.\n\n\tTommy Storch, a transportation procurement expert at Insight Sourcing Group, said FedEx and UPS have both gotten increasingly creative in their residential delivery surcharges as they have expanded their networks.\n\n\t\u201cOutside metro areas, costs get more expensive because the density of delivery is not as prevalent,\u201d Storch previously told Sourcing Journal. \u201cFedEx and UPS are very good at always creating new charges\u2026It\u2019s so complex, and they only make it more complex every single year. It\u2019s really something that if a shipper is not managing on a monthly basis, you can all of a sudden have your costs explode on you.\u201d\n\n\tAs of Jan. 1, 2024, FedEx will raise shipping rates 5.9 percent on average across its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery services. FedEx Ground Economy shipping rates will also increase an undisclosed amount.\n\n\tThe average annual rate increases are one percentage point lower than last year\u2019s general rate increase (GRI) of 6.9 percent. But the higher rates came when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 6.5 percent, well above the July 2023 inflation number of 3.2 percent.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAccording to FedEx, the price adjustments reflect incremental costs associated with the current operating environment, while also accounting for the investments the company has made in service enhancement, fleet maintenance, technology innovations \u201cand other areas to serve customers more effectively and efficiently.\u201d\n\n\tUPS has yet to unveil its 2024 GRI, but it has traditionally hiked rates directly in line with FedEx, which raised its rates 6.9 percent for 2023. Both companies raised GRI 5.9 percent in 2022, and 4.9 percent each year from 2012-2021.\n\n\tThe only reason this year could be different is based on speculation that UPS could decide to pass on the higher costs to customers after 340,000 unionized employees secured a new contract worth \u201c$30 billion in new money\u201d over five years.\n\n\tFedEx Freight shipping rates will increase by an average of 5.9 percent to 6.9 percent dependent on the customer\u2019s transportation rate scale. This change applies to shipments within the U.S. (including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada.\n\n\tDetails of all changes to rates, surcharges, and fees will be available on Sept. 7, the package delivery company says.\n\n\tAlso effective Jan. 1, FedEx will be increasing customs clearance service fees on imports.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Newsletters\n\t\n\t\nReceive Our Daily Newsletter & Special Offers\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Recommends\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAAFA Calls on Biden to Intervene in East Coast Port\u00a0Talks\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChain Reaction: John Singleton of Wen-Parker Logistics on Navigating Post-Pandemic Supply Chain\u00a0Disruptions\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018A Very Difficult Moment\u2019 for Retail: How Could A Change to De Minimis Impact Shippers\u2019\u00a0Costs?\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025\u00a0Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSJ Newsletters\t\t\n\t\n\nGet the news straight to your inbox\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVideos\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs Your Cotton Safe?

    "Summarized_Document": "FedEx is increasing surcharges for the 2023 peak season and has announced its general rate increase (GRI) for 2024. The company aims to boost profitability and cut $4 billion in costs by the end of its 2025 financial year.

Key surcharge changes include: \n\n- Small businesses using FedEx Ground Economy will see surcharges rise to $1.60 from Oct. 30 to Nov. 26 and Dec. 11 to Jan. 14, up from $1.50 last year. During the peak period from Nov. 27 to Dec. 10, surcharges will increase to $2.60 from $2.50. \n- 'Additional handling' surcharges will increase to $6.95 from $6.55 per package, and oversize charges will rise from $68.75 to $73. \n- Ground unauthorized package charges will jump to $410 from $385. \n\nFedEx is also targeting larger shippers' volume spikes during the holidays with a 'residential delivery charge' ranging from $1.35 to $6.35 per FedEx Ground package and $2.40 to $7.40 per FedEx Express package.

In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site. \n\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands. \n\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader. \n\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page. \n\n\nLanguage\n\n\u00a9 Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're permitted to use this graph as long as you provide prominent attribution with a link back close to the use of the graph.

In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site. \n\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands. \n\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader. \n\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page. \n\n\nLanguage\n\n\u00a9 Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're permitted to use this graph as long as you provide prominent attribution with a link back close to the use of the graph.

And it's picked up the pace in recent years.\nIn the last 80 years, sea level rise has risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that total in the last 30 years, said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's best estimates, that pace is expected to speed up\u2014dramatically.\nIt took about 80 years for the first foot. The second one will only take 30 years. The next, 20 years. And Florida could see the next foot in merely a decade after that.\n\"Sea level rise is beginning to speed up a bit,\" McNoldy said. \"If you draw a straight line it starts to not look so straight in recent decades.\"\nThat's according to NOAA's \"intermediate-high\" projection of sea level rise. The agency created a range of predictions\u2014low, intermediate-low, intermediate, intermediate-high and high\u2014to estimate what sea level rise could look like in places like Florida.\nSo far, scientists have found that we're trending toward the high end of those predictions.\n\"Presently, sea level is tracking in the intermediate-high to high, the two fastest,\" said Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist with Florida International University. \"The other three scenarios, you might not even think about because we're already rising faster than that.\"\nThose are the same predictions used by South Florida governments when deciding how high to build new developments. But after a new bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year, local governments hoping for state money for sea rise projects have to only consider the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios, a downgrade from previous legislation that asked them to consider intermediate-low and intermediate-high scenarios.\nWhat goes into a sea rise projection?\nTwo feet of sea rise by 2060, compared to present-day levels, would be a shock to the system for Miami, where the average elevation is three feet. That's why local governments\u2014and the state\u2014are spending billions to keep streets dry.\nHowever, pinning down exactly how much sea rise South Florida could experience is a tough task.\nResearchers know the two main factors in sea level rise are the temperature of the ocean and how much the ice sheets melt. As burned fossil fuels trap more heat in the atmosphere, that heat is largely being absorbed by the ocean. Hotter water physically takes up more space than cold water, so a hotter ocean means higher sea levels. A hotter atmosphere also means gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, pouring tremendous amounts of now-liquid water into the sea.\nThose two issues make up the lion's share of impact to rising sea levels, but South Florida also has its own unique challenges that add to rising water levels.\nThere's the fact that some parts of the land are actually sinking, a process known as subsidence. However, it's not very much\u2014the depth of two credit cards stacked on top of each other over half a decade in one spot in Miami Beach.\n\"It does add to an already dire situation, but it isn't a driving force,\" Parkinson said.\nThe one big unknown in South Florida's future of sea level rise is likely the water rushing offshore. The Gulf Stream, a massive current that moves hot water from the tropics to the frigid depths of the Arctic, has a little offshoot that runs between Florida's east coast and the Bahamas.\nThe Florida Current, as it's known, has an impact on Miami's water levels. When the current is stronger, water levels are generally a bit lower in Miami. And when it's weaker, they have been shown to rise.\nA new paper from Lisa Beal, professor of ocean sciences at UM's Rosenstiel School, and Chris Piecuch, a physical oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, found for the first time that this current may be slowing down.\n\"We found that there is a weakening. It's small,\" she said.\nThe article, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in September, suggested that the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% in the last 40 years, although it did not directly link that change to global warming.\nBeal said the findings were significant for Florida.\n\"We shouldn't get carried away that weakening of the Gulf Stream is going to double sea level rise in Miami. It isn't,\" she said. However, \"when you're so low-lying like South Florida, you'd kind of want to know because it means you reach thresholds of flooding much more quickly.\"\nBut perhaps the biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise boils down to one thing: exactly how much more pollution the world will continue to spew into the atmosphere. The lower-end predictions account for a world in which governments stop burning fossil fuels quickly, and the higher-end predictions are based on a situation where we burn even more than we are now.\n\"One of the great unknowns is, the world needs to be attempting to slow down the release of greenhouse gases,\" McNoldy said.\n\nJournal information:\nGeophysical Research Letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  2024 Miami Herald.

    "Summarized_Document": "Sea levels are rising faster in South Florida, impacting roads and homes. Over the past 80 years, sea levels have risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that rise occurring in the last 30 years, according to Brian McNoldy from the University of Miami. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts this pace will accelerate, with the next foot of rise expected in just 30 years, then 20 years, and possibly a decade after that. Currently, sea levels are tracking towards NOAA's intermediate-high to high projections, the fastest scenarios. Local governments in South Florida use these projections to plan new developments, although recent legislation now requires them to consider only the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios for state-funded projects. The main factors driving sea level rise are ocean temperature and ice sheet melt. As fossil fuels trap more heat, the ocean absorbs it, causing water to expand and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, adding more water to the sea. South Florida also faces land subsidence, though it's minimal. The Florida Current, part of the Gulf Stream, affects Miami's water levels; a weaker current can lead to higher sea levels. A study by Lisa Beal and Chris Piecuch found the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% over the last 40 years. The biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise is the amount of pollution the world will continue to emit. Lower-end predictions assume a rapid reduction in fossil fuel use, while higher-end predictions assume continued or increased emissions.",

    "Summarized_Document": "Sea levels are rising faster in South Florida, impacting roads and homes. Over the past 80 years, sea levels have risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that rise occurring in the last 30 years, according to Brian McNoldy from the University of Miami. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts this pace will accelerate, with the next foot of rise expected in just 30 years, then 20 years, and possibly a decade after that. Currently, sea levels are tracking towards NOAA's intermediate-high to high projections, the fastest scenarios. Local governments in South Florida use these projections to plan new developments, although recent legislation now requires them to consider only the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios for state-funded projects. The main factors driving sea level rise are ocean temperature and ice sheet melt. As fossil fuels trap more heat, the ocean absorbs it, causing water to expand and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, adding more water to the sea. South Florida also faces land subsidence, though it's minimal. The Florida Current, part of the Gulf Stream, affects Miami's water levels; a weaker current can lead to higher sea levels. A study by Lisa Beal and Chris Piecuch found the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% over the last 40 years. The biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise is the amount of pollution the world will continue to emit. Lower-end predictions assume a rapid reduction in fossil fuel use, while higher-end predictions assume continued or increased emissions.",

    "Summarized_Document": "After cyclone gales destroyed his home in 2007, Bangladeshi fisherman Abdul Aziz moved half a kilometer inland. A year later, the sea swallowed his old home. Now, 75-year-old Aziz fishes above his submerged former home and lives behind a low embankment. Government scientists report that rising seas driven by climate change are submerging Bangladesh's coast at one of the fastest global rates, potentially displacing at least a million people within a generation. Abdul Hamid, director general of the environment department, noted that Bangladesh experiences the effects of climate change intensely. A recent three-part study found that sea levels in Bangladesh are rising more than 60% higher than the global average. By 2050, over a million people may need to relocate due to local sea level rise, based on 25 years of satellite data from NASA and CNSA. Study lead A.K.M Saiful Islam attributed the above-average increases to melting ice caps, warming oceans, and river water from the monsoon. The study observed sea level rises of 4.2 to 5.8 millimeters annually along Bangladesh's coast, compared to the global average of 3.7 millimeters. This incremental rise has devastating effects on the estimated 20 million coastal residents. Most coastal areas are just one or two meters above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, salinizing wells and lakes and killing crops. Cyclones, which have killed hundreds of thousands in recent decades, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Shahjalal Mia, a restaurant owner, noted the worsening cyclones and heat waves, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. Bangladesh is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. In April, the country experienced its hottest month and most sustained heat wave. A recent cyclone killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes. Ainun Nishat from Brac University emphasized that the poorest are paying the price for emissions from wealthier nations.

Notes UK overview March overall was unsettled, wet and dull. The month began colder than normal across the UK, with temperatures across the UK cooler than average and southern areas recording notably low daily minimum temperatures (for instance, Benson in Oxfordshire recorded -4.6\u00b0C on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd across parts of south west England, causing some travel disruption. However, the cool weather was replaced with milder weather for much of the rest of the month, with temperatures widely into the mid to high teens at times (for instance, a maximum of 18.8\u00b0C was recorded at Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th). Temperatures dipped again towards the end of the month, and on the 27th/28th, some areas around Plymouth and Dartmoor experienced snowy conditions overnight. Overall the weather was unsettled, with a succession of frontal systems bringing rain and wind. By mid-month, several counties including London and Kent had already provisionally experienced their whole-month average rainfall, and continued to be soaked throughout the rest of the month. The month ended on an unsettled note, with widespread showers and strong winds across the UK. Overall, the provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was much milder than areas further north, with a provisional mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C (anomaly of 1.4\u00b0C) for southern England and 5.0\u00b0C (anomaly of 0.6\u00b0C) for Scotland. England provisionally recorded the seventh-warmest March on record in a series from 1884. The UK overall recorded provisionally 127% of the long term average rainfall for March, with much of this concentrated in the south. England and Wales both recorded more than 150% of their long term average monthly rainfall, while Scotland recorded just 90% of the average March rainfall. County Down in Northern Ireland provisionally experienced its third wettest March on record (145.9mm) in a series from 1836. As well as wet, the month was also dull, with the UK provisionally recording just 95.2 hours of sunshine (87% of the long term average). Reference climatology used for calculating anomalies is the period 1991-2020 unless otherwise stated. Weather impacts \u2022 Snow across Ireland, southwest Midlands and the Bristol area caused traffic disruption and road closures \u2022 Persistent rain across the country throughout the month, particularly in southern England, caused groundwater and surface water flooding March started with heavy snow across southern and western parts of Northern Ireland, with the Enniskillen area reporting numerous traffic incidents and several fallen trees as a result of the snow. Parts of the Peak District and south Pennines also experienced snow, with several roads reported closed for a period. Further south, a heavy hail storm in Sussex on the 1st may have contributed to a major road traffic collision on the M23. Further snow on the 2nd hit the south-western Midlands and Bristol area, with reports of several snow-related traffic incidents and the use of snow ploughs to clear a section of the M4. The rest of the month saw unsettled weather with regular bouts of rain. Ongoing groundwater flooding in Suffolk that began in February continued well into March, bringing significant traffic disruption. However, there was otherwise relatively little in the way of impactful rain up until the final week of the month. The last week of March brought rain, snow, and strong winds. Heavy rain in Cornwall on the 25th/26th as a result of a stalling weather front led to flooding; the Cornwall Fire and Rescue service reported rescuing six people from flooding incidents on the roads which included rescues from flooded cars. On the 27th, the rain turned to snow across southwest England, leading to travel disruption including reports of abandoned vehicles around Dartmoor and further road disruption in mid-Wales as the area of precipitation moved north. Strong winds and locally intense rainfall on the 28th affected southern areas of Wales and England, resulting in several incidents of surface water flooding that led to the closure of several roads in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire to allow the floodwater to drain. The month closed with scattered heavy showers on the 29th, before the weather settled a little over the Easter weekend. Monthly extremes The table below lists UK monthly weather extremes recorded at individual weather stations during March 2024 from data available on 02/04/2024.

The wind anomaly map shows shaded (scalar) wind speed anomalies with arrows as (vector) wind anomalies. Text not available. Weather diary \u2022 Low pressure dominating, wet and windy The weather pattern for March was characterized by a series of Atlantic low pressure systems crossing the country through the month with just a brief settled spell during the 2nd week and the occasional transient ridge of high pressure. Wet and windy was the order of the day on the 1st with a deep low crossing central England, producing significant rainfall across all regions, and some very strong winds for the south coast, gusts to 80mph being reported in places. Low pressure continued to dominate through to the 6th. By the 7th, high pressure had become established over Scandinavia and the UK fell under the influence of a continental easterly until the 11th. The consequence of that was northern parts of England and all of Scotland remained mostly dry but cold, and any weather systems were pushed south, bringing more wind and rain to southern and southwestern counties. However, by the 13th, the high pressure had all but vanished, allowing a mobile westerly airstream to resume over the UK with the latest system bringing heavy and persistent rain particularly to Northern Ireland, north Wales and northwest England. Parts of Snowdonia saw nearly 100mm of rain over a 24 hour period. From the 13th to the 25th, the UK was hit by a series of depressions, with their attendant fronts bringing more wind and rain across all regions. After the 20th, the trajectory of the lows changed to approach the UK from a more southerly direction. The resulting southwesterly winds finally brought some milder conditions, with maximum temperatures widely into the mid-teens Celsius, slightly higher over southern England. After the 25th and to the end of the month, a north-south split was evident with Scotland subject to a cold and showery northeasterly airstream, with the rest of the UK milder but very wet at times. Notes The Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884, and this report forms a continuation of that series. The purpose of each report is to provide an overview of the weather conditions across the UK for that month. The emphasis is mainly based on observations from the surface network of weather stations. Climate series based on from data from these stations are used to provide long term context. This summary was produced on 03/04/2024 14:28. The statistics are a provisional assessment of the observational data available at the time of production. Ongoing data receipt and quality assurance processes may result in subsequent updates to the statistics presented. If you have any questions or feedback about this product, spot any data errors or omissions, or wish to obtain further data, please contact the Met Office. For historical monthly weather reports please visit the Library and Archive. o The land-surface observations presented in this report are from the Met Office official weather station network which includes both automatic weather stations and manual climate stations operated by volunteer observers. Rainfall data are from the official registered rain-gauge network which includes rain-gauges operated by a number of key partners including the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and Northern Ireland Water. o The observations are carefully managed such that they conform to current best-practice observational standards as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The observations also pass through a range of quality assurance procedures at the Met Office before application for climate monitoring. o Daily and monthly maps, monthly statistics and monthly time-series are primarily based on the HadUK-Grid dataset of 1km resolution UK gridded climate data (Hollis et al, 2019). Monthly statistics from the monthly Central England temperature series 1659 (Manley, 1974) and England and Wales precipitation series from 1766 (Wigley et al, 1984) provide long term context. o The monthly lightning activity map is based on data from the Met Office ATDnet (Arrival Time Difference Network) system. This is an automatic lightning location network comprising around ten lightning outstation sensors located across Europe. o The monthly maps of mean sea level pressure and 250hPa wind speed and direction are based on the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al, 2019). ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics.

    "Summarized_Document": "March 2024 Monthly Weather Report\n\nUK Overview\nMarch was unsettled, wet, and dull. The month began colder than normal, with notable low temperatures in southern areas (e.g., -4.6\u00b0C in Benson, Oxfordshire on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd in southwest England, causing travel disruptions. Milder weather followed, with temperatures reaching up to 18.8\u00b0C in Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th. The month ended with unsettled weather, including rain and wind. The provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was milder with a mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C, while Scotland had 5.0\u00b0C. The UK recorded 127% of the long-term average rainfall for March, with England and Wales exceeding 150% of their averages. County Down in Northern Ireland had its third wettest March on record with 145.9mm of rain. The UK recorded just 95.2 hours of sunshine, 87% of the long-term average.\n\nWeather Impacts\nSnow in Ireland, southwest Midlands, and Bristol caused traffic disruptions. Persistent rain, especially in southern England, led to groundwater and surface water flooding. Heavy snow on the 1st and 2nd caused traffic incidents and road closures. The rest of the month saw regular rain, with significant flooding in Cornwall on the 25th/26th. The month ended with heavy showers and some settled weather over Easter.\n\nMonthly Extremes\n- Highest Maximum: 18.8\u00b0C on 20th at Charlwood, Surrey\n- Lowest Maximum: 1.2\u00b0C on 2nd at Pennerley, Shropshire\n- Highest Minimum: 11.6\u00b0C on 14th at Prestatyn, Clwyd\n- Lowest Minimum: -6.9\u00b0C on 26th at Altnaharra No 2, Sutherland\n- Most Rainfall: 94.4mm on 13th at Capel Curig No 3, Gwynedd\n- Most Sunshine: 11.5 hours on 30th at Kirkwall, Orkney and 31st at Bewcastle, Cumbria\n- Highest Gust: 70Kt (81mph) on 1st and 28th at Wight: Needles Old Battery, Isle of Wight\n- Greatest Snow Depth: 12cm on 1st at Lough Navar Forest, Fermanagh\n\nMonthly Climate Statistics\n- Mean Maximum Temperature: UK 10.0\u00b0C, England 11.1\u00b0C, Wales 10.0\u00b0C, Scotland 8.1\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 9.7\u00b0C\n- Mean Minimum Temperature: UK 3.5\u00b0C, England 4.4\u00b0C, Wales 4.0\u00b0C, Scotland 1.9\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 3.5\u00b0C\n- Mean Temperature: UK 6.7\u00b0C, England 7.8\u00b0C, Wales 7.0\u00b0C, Scotland 5.0\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 6.6\u00b0C\n- Rainfall: UK 107.8mm (127% of average), England 94.3mm (162%), Wales 158.2mm (153%), Scotland 112.7mm (90%), Northern Ireland 129.2mm (149%)\n- Sunshine: UK 95.2 hours (87% of average), England 93.4 hours (80%), Wales 86.8 hours (79%), Scotland 101.4 hours (104%), Northern Ireland 88.9 hours (88%)\n- Windspeed: UK 9.9 knots, England 8.9 knots, Wales 10.7 knots, Scotland 11.4 knots, Northern Ireland 9.9 knots\n\nMonthly Time-Series\n- Mean Temperature: 6.7\u00b0C (2024), 6.0\u00b0C (2015-2024), 5.7\u00b0C (1991-2020), 4.7\u00b0C (1961-1990)\n- Rainfall: 107.8mm (2024), 96.5mm (2015-2024), 85.1mm (1991-2020), 91.0mm (1961-1990)\n- Sunshine: 95.2 hours (2024), 113.6 hours (2015-2024), 109.2 hours (1991-2020), 100.0 hours (1961-1990)\n\nWeather Diary\nMarch was dominated by Atlantic low-pressure systems, with brief settled spells. The month started wet and windy, with significant rainfall and strong winds. High pressure over Scandinavia brought dry but cold conditions to northern England and Scotland from the 7th to the 11th.

Notes UK overview March overall was unsettled, wet and dull. The month began colder than normal across the UK, with temperatures across the UK cooler than average and southern areas recording notably low daily minimum temperatures (for instance, Benson in Oxfordshire recorded -4.6\u00b0C on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd across parts of south west England, causing some travel disruption. However, the cool weather was replaced with milder weather for much of the rest of the month, with temperatures widely into the mid to high teens at times (for instance, a maximum of 18.8\u00b0C was recorded at Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th). Temperatures dipped again towards the end of the month, and on the 27th/28th, some areas around Plymouth and Dartmoor experienced snowy conditions overnight. Overall the weather was unsettled, with a succession of frontal systems bringing rain and wind. By mid-month, several counties including London and Kent had already provisionally experienced their whole-month average rainfall, and continued to be soaked throughout the rest of the month. The month ended on an unsettled note, with widespread showers and strong winds across the UK. Overall, the provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was much milder than areas further north, with a provisional mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C (anomaly of 1.4\u00b0C) for southern England and 5.0\u00b0C (anomaly of 0.6\u00b0C) for Scotland. England provisionally recorded the seventh-warmest March on record in a series from 1884. The UK overall recorded provisionally 127% of the long term average rainfall for March, with much of this concentrated in the south. England and Wales both recorded more than 150% of their long term average monthly rainfall, while Scotland recorded just 90% of the average March rainfall. County Down in Northern Ireland provisionally experienced its third wettest March on record (145.9mm) in a series from 1836. As well as wet, the month was also dull, with the UK provisionally recording just 95.2 hours of sunshine (87% of the long term average). Reference climatology used for calculating anomalies is the period 1991-2020 unless otherwise stated. Weather impacts \u2022 Snow across Ireland, southwest Midlands and the Bristol area caused traffic disruption and road closures \u2022 Persistent rain across the country throughout the month, particularly in southern England, caused groundwater and surface water flooding March started with heavy snow across southern and western parts of Northern Ireland, with the Enniskillen area reporting numerous traffic incidents and several fallen trees as a result of the snow. Parts of the Peak District and south Pennines also experienced snow, with several roads reported closed for a period. Further south, a heavy hail storm in Sussex on the 1st may have contributed to a major road traffic collision on the M23. Further snow on the 2nd hit the south-western Midlands and Bristol area, with reports of several snow-related traffic incidents and the use of snow ploughs to clear a section of the M4. The rest of the month saw unsettled weather with regular bouts of rain. Ongoing groundwater flooding in Suffolk that began in February continued well into March, bringing significant traffic disruption. However, there was otherwise relatively little in the way of impactful rain up until the final week of the month. The last week of March brought rain, snow, and strong winds. Heavy rain in Cornwall on the 25th/26th as a result of a stalling weather front led to flooding; the Cornwall Fire and Rescue service reported rescuing six people from flooding incidents on the roads which included rescues from flooded cars. On the 27th, the rain turned to snow across southwest England, leading to travel disruption including reports of abandoned vehicles around Dartmoor and further road disruption in mid-Wales as the area of precipitation moved north. Strong winds and locally intense rainfall on the 28th affected southern areas of Wales and England, resulting in several incidents of surface water flooding that led to the closure of several roads in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire to allow the floodwater to drain. The month closed with scattered heavy showers on the 29th, before the weather settled a little over the Easter weekend. Monthly extremes The table below lists UK monthly weather extremes recorded at individual weather stations during March 2024 from data available on 02/04/2024.

The wind anomaly map shows shaded (scalar) wind speed anomalies with arrows as (vector) wind anomalies. Text not available. Weather diary \u2022 Low pressure dominating, wet and windy The weather pattern for March was characterized by a series of Atlantic low pressure systems crossing the country through the month with just a brief settled spell during the 2nd week and the occasional transient ridge of high pressure. Wet and windy was the order of the day on the 1st with a deep low crossing central England, producing significant rainfall across all regions, and some very strong winds for the south coast, gusts to 80mph being reported in places. Low pressure continued to dominate through to the 6th. By the 7th, high pressure had become established over Scandinavia and the UK fell under the influence of a continental easterly until the 11th. The consequence of that was northern parts of England and all of Scotland remained mostly dry but cold, and any weather systems were pushed south, bringing more wind and rain to southern and southwestern counties. However, by the 13th, the high pressure had all but vanished, allowing a mobile westerly airstream to resume over the UK with the latest system bringing heavy and persistent rain particularly to Northern Ireland, north Wales and northwest England. Parts of Snowdonia saw nearly 100mm of rain over a 24 hour period. From the 13th to the 25th, the UK was hit by a series of depressions, with their attendant fronts bringing more wind and rain across all regions. After the 20th, the trajectory of the lows changed to approach the UK from a more southerly direction. The resulting southwesterly winds finally brought some milder conditions, with maximum temperatures widely into the mid-teens Celsius, slightly higher over southern England. After the 25th and to the end of the month, a north-south split was evident with Scotland subject to a cold and showery northeasterly airstream, with the rest of the UK milder but very wet at times. Notes The Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884, and this report forms a continuation of that series. The purpose of each report is to provide an overview of the weather conditions across the UK for that month. The emphasis is mainly based on observations from the surface network of weather stations. Climate series based on from data from these stations are used to provide long term context. This summary was produced on 03/04/2024 14:28. The statistics are a provisional assessment of the observational data available at the time of production. Ongoing data receipt and quality assurance processes may result in subsequent updates to the statistics presented. If you have any questions or feedback about this product, spot any data errors or omissions, or wish to obtain further data, please contact the Met Office. For historical monthly weather reports please visit the Library and Archive. o The land-surface observations presented in this report are from the Met Office official weather station network which includes both automatic weather stations and manual climate stations operated by volunteer observers. Rainfall data are from the official registered rain-gauge network which includes rain-gauges operated by a number of key partners including the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and Northern Ireland Water. o The observations are carefully managed such that they conform to current best-practice observational standards as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The observations also pass through a range of quality assurance procedures at the Met Office before application for climate monitoring. o Daily and monthly maps, monthly statistics and monthly time-series are primarily based on the HadUK-Grid dataset of 1km resolution UK gridded climate data (Hollis et al, 2019). Monthly statistics from the monthly Central England temperature series 1659 (Manley, 1974) and England and Wales precipitation series from 1766 (Wigley et al, 1984) provide long term context. o The monthly lightning activity map is based on data from the Met Office ATDnet (Arrival Time Difference Network) system. This is an automatic lightning location network comprising around ten lightning outstation sensors located across Europe. o The monthly maps of mean sea level pressure and 250hPa wind speed and direction are based on the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al, 2019). ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics.

    "Summarized_Document": "March 2024 Monthly Weather Report\n\nUK Overview\nMarch was unsettled, wet, and dull. The month began colder than normal, with notable low temperatures in southern areas (e.g., -4.6\u00b0C in Benson, Oxfordshire on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd in southwest England, causing travel disruptions. Milder weather followed, with temperatures reaching up to 18.8\u00b0C in Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th. The month ended with unsettled weather, including rain and wind. The provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was milder with a mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C, while Scotland had 5.0\u00b0C. The UK recorded 127% of the long-term average rainfall for March, with England and Wales exceeding 150% of their averages. County Down in Northern Ireland had its third wettest March on record with 145.9mm of rain. The UK recorded just 95.2 hours of sunshine, 87% of the long-term average.\n\nWeather Impacts\nSnow in Ireland, southwest Midlands, and Bristol caused traffic disruptions. Persistent rain, especially in southern England, led to groundwater and surface water flooding. Heavy snow on the 1st and 2nd caused traffic incidents and road closures. The rest of the month saw regular rain, with significant flooding in Cornwall on the 25th/26th. The month ended with heavy showers and some settled weather over Easter.\n\nMonthly Extremes\n- Highest Maximum: 18.8\u00b0C on 20th at Charlwood, Surrey\n- Lowest Maximum: 1.2\u00b0C on 2nd at Pennerley, Shropshire\n- Highest Minimum: 11.6\u00b0C on 14th at Prestatyn, Clwyd\n- Lowest Minimum: -6.9\u00b0C on 26th at Altnaharra No 2, Sutherland\n- Most Rainfall: 94.4mm on 13th at Capel Curig No 3, Gwynedd\n- Most Sunshine: 11.5 hours on 30th at Kirkwall, Orkney and 31st at Bewcastle, Cumbria\n- Highest Gust: 70Kt (81mph) on 1st and 28th at Wight: Needles Old Battery, Isle of Wight\n- Greatest Snow Depth: 12cm on 1st at Lough Navar Forest, Fermanagh\n\nMonthly Climate Statistics\n- Mean Maximum Temperature: UK 10.0\u00b0C, England 11.1\u00b0C, Wales 10.0\u00b0C, Scotland 8.1\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 9.7\u00b0C\n- Mean Minimum Temperature: UK 3.5\u00b0C, England 4.4\u00b0C, Wales 4.0\u00b0C, Scotland 1.9\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 3.5\u00b0C\n- Mean Temperature: UK 6.7\u00b0C, England 7.8\u00b0C, Wales 7.0\u00b0C, Scotland 5.0\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 6.6\u00b0C\n- Rainfall: UK 107.8mm (127% of average), England 94.3mm (162%), Wales 158.2mm (153%), Scotland 112.7mm (90%), Northern Ireland 129.2mm (149%)\n- Sunshine: UK 95.2 hours (87% of average), England 93.4 hours (80%), Wales 86.8 hours (79%), Scotland 101.4 hours (104%), Northern Ireland 88.9 hours (88%)\n- Windspeed: UK 9.9 knots, England 8.9 knots, Wales 10.7 knots, Scotland 11.4 knots, Northern Ireland 9.9 knots\n\nMonthly Time-Series\n- Mean Temperature: 6.7\u00b0C (2024), 6.0\u00b0C (2015-2024), 5.7\u00b0C (1991-2020), 4.7\u00b0C (1961-1990)\n- Rainfall: 107.8mm (2024), 96.5mm (2015-2024), 85.1mm (1991-2020), 91.0mm (1961-1990)\n- Sunshine: 95.2 hours (2024), 113.6 hours (2015-2024), 109.2 hours (1991-2020), 100.0 hours (1961-1990)\n\nWeather Diary\nMarch was dominated by Atlantic low-pressure systems, with brief settled spells. The month started wet and windy, with significant rainfall and strong winds. High pressure over Scandinavia brought dry but cold conditions to northern England and Scotland from the 7th to the 11th. From the 13th to the 25th, a series of depressions brought more wind and rain. After the 25th, a north-south split was evident, with Scotland experiencing cold and showery weather, while the rest of the UK was milder but wet.\n\nNotes\nThe Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884.

    "Document": "Brazil \u2013 Extreme Rainfall Days in Metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo Have Risen Four-Fold\nStudy by researchers at Brazil\u2019s National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) reveals that etreme rainfall days in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have risen four-fold in seven decades. The research also shows a rise in the number of consecutive dry days, suggesting that extreme rainfall events are concentrated in shorter, more widely spaced periods.\nExtreme rainfall has become increasingly common in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The capital of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in the southern hemisphere. The metropolitan area suffered from flooding due to heavy rain in February. Early in the month, no less than 114 millimeters (mm) fell in a single 24-hour period. This was the second highest 24-hour amount for the month since 1943, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET).\nAccording to a study by researchers at the Natural Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN), an agency of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC), both the total rainfall and the frequency of extreme rainfall events in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have increased significantly in the last seven decades.\nWhile there were practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s, such days have occurred between twice and five times per year in the last ten years in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, according to the authors.\nThe study was supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation \u2013 FAPESP under the aegis of its Research Program on Global Climate Change (RPGCC). The findings are reported in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.\nResearchers affiliated with INMET, the National Space Research Institute (INPE) and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG-USP) also took part in the study.\n\u201cIntense rainstorms lasting a few hours with huge amounts of water, as much as 80 mm or 100 mm, are no longer sporadic events. They\u2019re happening more and more frequently,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo, a senior researcher at CEMADEN and principal investigator for the study, told.\nThe researchers analyzed data collected by INMET\u2019s weather stations at IAG-USP and Santana Lookout in the northern part of the city. The analysis showed an increase in the number of days with heavy rain and in the frequency of rainfall extremes, especially during the rainy season (spring-summer).\nThe dry season used to occur between April and September in most of the state but has lasted until October in recent decades. The number of consecutive days without any rain at all has also gradually increased, suggesting that heavy rainfall events are concentrated in fewer days, interrupted by longer periods of hot dry weather.\nWith fewer cold nights and more hot days, convective rainfall is more likely to occur, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall, the authors note.\nIn convective rainfall, the ground heats up, boosting evaporation and causing warm moist air to rise (convection). As the air ascends, it cools and forms convective clouds, which precipitate upon reaching saturation.\n\u201cWe observed a long-term trend in this kind of weather event, with very strong signs that climate change is in progress,\u201d Marengo said.\nRecords from the IAG-USP and Santana Lookout weather stations showed a four-fold increase in the number of days with rainfall exceeding 100 mm between 2000 and 2018 compared with those from the 1940s or 1960s.\nRecords from IAG-USP also showed an increase in total rainfall, in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, and in the frequency of consecutive dry days in the period 1931-2017.\n\u201cThis suggests that the increase in total rainfall in S\u00e3o Paulo in recent decades was due to an increase in \u2018heavy\u2019 precipitation, concentrated in fewer days and with longer dry spells in between,\u201d Marengo said.\nCauses\nAccording to the researchers, the changing rainfall regime in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo may be due to natural climate variability but may also be related to global warming and growing urbanization that has occurred especially in the last 40 years, which has exacerbated the occurrence of urban heat islands.\nThe growth of urbanization has transformed the region\u2019s previously exposed soil and Atlantic Rainforest remnants into sealed concrete, cement and asphalt surfaces that absorb heat while retaining no moisture. The temperature rises during the day, and as the sun goes down, the accumulated heat rises into the atmosphere, the relative humidity falls, and water evaporates rapidly from the ground to form towering cumulonimbus clouds, Marengo explained.\nIn his view, heat islands and similar effects help explain the increase in extreme rainfall events that occurred in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo between 1933 and 2010.\nIn the last 20 years, these changes in the rainfall regime, in conjunction with the high-risk construction of buildings on hillsides and riverbanks, have led to an increase in hydrometeorological hazards, triggering disasters such as flash floods, river flooding and landslides, the authors note.\n\u201cAn extreme rainfall event isn\u2019t itself a natural disaster. So-called natural disasters actually result from a combination of factors ranging from climate and weather to urban, economic and social phenomena. In other words, they\u2019re also anthropogenic disasters that result from human action, not just climate,\u201d Marengo said.\nMost Brazilian states suffer from flooding, but it is worst in S\u00e3o Paulo, which accounts for 33.36% of cases, followed by Santa Catarina (11.25%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.06%), Paran\u00e1 (8.33%), Rio de Janeiro (7.28%) and Minas Gerais (5.96%).\nSome 170 river floods and flash floods occurred in the period 2014-18. Flash floods produced the most deaths and serious injuries, followed by landslides and mudslides.\n\u201cThe Southeast and South regions of Brazil are the worst affected by hydrometeorological disasters because of their population density,\u201d Marengo said.\n\u201cLandslides, for example, only kill people because they\u2019re forced to live in high-risk areas where no one should build a home. The streets only fill up with water because the rivers have been channelized and buried, and the city\u2019s surfaces are sealed with asphalt and concrete.\u201d\nSource: Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\nRelated\nBrazil\nIndonesia \u2013 at Least 3 Dead, 2 Missing After Floods and Landslides in 3 Provinces\nUSA \u2013  Neptune Flood Insurance Now Available in 42 States\n\nECMWF\nLatest Articles\nFollow Us\nCategories\nFlood News in Americas by Country\nEditor's Picks\nDepave \u2013 the Community-Based Approach to Storm Water Management\nUsing Drones for Flood Disaster Risk Reduction, Assessment and Recovery\nFlood Protection Options for Airports\nReport \u2013 Flood Losses in Europe to Increase Fivefold by 2050\nUN \u2013 1995 to 2015, Flood Disasters Affected 2.3 Billion and Killed 157,000\nDrowning World \u2013 Photographer Gideon Mendel\u2019s 8 Year Project\nFlood and High Water Marks\nG-Cans Project, Tokyo \u2013 Japan\u2019s $2.6 Billion Flood Tunnel\nCookies | Privacy |  Contacts\nNorth America\nSouth America\nEurope\nAsia\nAfrica\nOceania\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 FloodList \n",

In February, S\u00e3o Paulo experienced significant flooding, with 114 millimeters (mm) of rain falling in a single 24-hour period, the second highest for the month since 1943. The study, supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and reported in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, shows that days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) have increased from practically none in the 1950s to between two and five times per year in the last decade. Researchers from INMET, INPE, and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo also contributed to the study. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo, a senior researcher at CEMADEN, noted that intense rainstorms with 80 mm to 100 mm of rain are becoming more frequent. Data from INMET\u2019s weather stations at IAG-USP and Santana Lookout showed a four-fold increase in days with rainfall exceeding 100 mm between 2000 and 2018 compared to the 1940s or 1960s. The study also found an increase in total rainfall, the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, and consecutive dry days from 1931 to 2017. The researchers suggest that these changes may be due to natural climate variability, global warming, and urbanization, which has created urban heat islands. These changes, combined with high-risk construction on hillsides and riverbanks, have increased hydrometeorological hazards, leading to more flash floods, river flooding, and landslides. S\u00e3o Paulo accounts for 33.36% of flooding cases in Brazil, followed by Santa Catarina (11.25%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.06%), Paran\u00e1 (8.33%), Rio de Janeiro (7.28%), and Minas Gerais (5.96%).

The research also shows a rise in the number of consecutive dry days, suggesting that extreme rainfall events are concentrated in shorter, more widely spaced periods.\nExtreme rainfall has become increasingly common in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The capital of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in the southern hemisphere. The metropolitan area suffered from flooding due to heavy rain in February. Early in the month, no less than 114 millimeters (mm) fell in a single 24-hour period. This was the second highest 24-hour amount for the month since 1943, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET).\nAccording to a study by researchers at the Natural Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN), an agency of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC), both the total rainfall and the frequency of extreme rainfall events in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have increased significantly in the last seven decades.\nWhile there were practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s, such days have occurred between twice and five times per year in the last ten years in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, according to the authors.\nThe study was supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation \u2013 FAPESP under the aegis of its Research Program on Global Climate Change (RPGCC). The findings are reported in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.\nResearchers affiliated with INMET, the National Space Research Institute (INPE) and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG-USP) also took part in the study.\n\u201cIntense rainstorms lasting a few hours with huge amounts of water, as much as 80 mm or 100 mm, are no longer sporadic events. They\u2019re happening more and more frequently,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo, a senior researcher at CEMADEN and principal investigator for the study, told.\nThe researchers analyzed data collected by INMET\u2019s weather stations at IAG-USP and Santana Lookout in the northern part of the city. The analysis showed an increase in the number of days with heavy rain and in the frequency of rainfall extremes, especially during the rainy season (spring-summer).\nThe dry season used to occur between April and September in most of the state but has lasted until October in recent decades. The number of consecutive days without any rain at all has also gradually increased, suggesting that heavy rainfall events are concentrated in fewer days, interrupted by longer periods of hot dry weather.\nWith fewer cold nights and more hot days, convective rainfall is more likely to occur, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall, the authors note.\nIn convective rainfall, the ground heats up, boosting evaporation and causing warm moist air to rise (convection). As the air ascends, it cools and forms convective clouds, which precipitate upon reaching saturation.\n\u201cWe observed a long-term trend in this kind of weather event, with very strong signs that climate change is in progress,\u201d Marengo said.\nRecords from the IAG-USP and Santana Lookout weather stations showed a four-fold increase in the number of days with rainfall exceeding 100 mm between 2000 and 2018 compared with those from the 1940s or 1960s.\nRecords from IAG-USP also showed an increase in total rainfall, in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, and in the frequency of consecutive dry days in the period 1931-2017.\n\u201cThis suggests that the increase in total rainfall in S\u00e3o Paulo in recent decades was due to an increase in \u2018heavy\u2019 precipitation, concentrated in fewer days and with longer dry spells in between,\u201d Marengo said.\nCauses\nAccording to the researchers, the changing rainfall regime in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo may be due to natural climate variability but may also be related to global warming and growing urbanization that has occurred especially in the last 40 years, which has exacerbated the occurrence of urban heat islands.\nThe growth of urbanization has transformed the region\u2019s previously exposed soil and Atlantic Rainforest remnants into sealed concrete, cement and asphalt surfaces that absorb heat while retaining no moisture. The temperature rises during the day, and as the sun goes down, the accumulated heat rises into the atmosphere, the relative humidity falls, and water evaporates rapidly from the ground to form towering cumulonimbus clouds, Marengo explained.\nIn his view, heat islands and similar effects help explain the increase in extreme rainfall events that occurred in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo between 1933 and 2010.\nIn the last 20 years, these changes in the rainfall regime, in conjunction with the high-risk construction of buildings on hillsides and riverbanks, have led to an increase in hydrometeorological hazards, triggering disasters such as flash floods, river flooding and landslides, the authors note.\n\u201cAn extreme rainfall event isn\u2019t itself a natural disaster. So-called natural disasters actually result from a combination of factors ranging from climate and weather to urban, economic and social phenomena. In other words, they\u2019re also anthropogenic disasters that result from human action, not just climate,\u201d Marengo said.\nMost Brazilian states suffer from flooding, but it is worst in S\u00e3o Paulo, which accounts for 33.36% of cases, followed by Santa Catarina (11.25%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.06%), Paran\u00e1 (8.33%), Rio de Janeiro (7.28%) and Minas Gerais (5.96%).\nSome 170 river floods and flash floods occurred in the period 2014-18. Flash floods produced the most deaths and serious injuries, followed by landslides and mudslides.\n\u201cThe Southeast and South regions of Brazil are the worst affected by hydrometeorological disasters because of their population density,\u201d Marengo said.\n\u201cLandslides, for example, only kill people because they\u2019re forced to live in high-risk areas where no one should build a home. The streets only fill up with water because the rivers have been channelized and buried, and the city\u2019s surfaces are sealed with asphalt and concrete.\u201d\nSource: Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\nRelated\nBrazil\nIndonesia \u2013 at Least 3 Dead, 2 Missing After Floods and Landslides in 3 Provinces\nUSA \u2013  Neptune Flood Insurance Now Available in 42 States\n\nECMWF\nLatest Articles\nFollow Us\nCategories\nFlood News in Americas by Country\nEditor's Picks\nDepave \u2013 the Community-Based Approach to Storm Water Management\nUsing Drones for Flood Disaster Risk Reduction, Assessment and Recovery\nFlood Protection Options for Airports\nReport \u2013 Flood Losses in Europe to Increase Fivefold by 2050\nUN \u2013 1995 to 2015, Flood Disasters Affected 2.3 Billion and Killed 157,000\nDrowning World \u2013 Photographer Gideon Mendel\u2019s 8 Year Project\nFlood and High Water Marks\nG-Cans Project, Tokyo \u2013 Japan\u2019s $2.6 Billion Flood Tunnel\nCookies | Privacy |  Contacts\nNorth America\nSouth America\nEurope\nAsia\nAfrica\nOceania\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 FloodList \n",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4. Difference from average Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) for the state of Kansas during the February 12-26, 2024 period as compared to the long-term average. Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",
    "Summarized_Document": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",

    "Summarized_Document": "Lionel Messi could dribble his way out of a phone box that he'd been locked in with five world-class defenders while handcuffed and wearing flip-flops. Say what you like about his standing in the GOAT debate, but you'd have to be the most cynical football fan of all time if you don't feel at least a little bit giddy when Messi dribbles at full speed. Yes, you could well throw the book at him whenever his mazy runs don't end up in a goal or assist, but sometimes that simply doesn't matter and the sheer spectacle of football is what provides the joy.\n\nThe magic of Messi\n\nAnd that's why so many of Messi's biggest fans are drawn to the way he plays the game, barely caring what the final score might be or how many goals he scores, but just unabashedly focusing on the entertainment factor. It's the whole argument that Messi is the greatest player of all time for simply having a certain je ne sais quoi that transcends Twitter threads, fan arguments and Ballon d'Or totals. However, before we go down a flowery and poetic rabbit hole of what it is that makes Messi special, let's try and ground it in the statistics because even the most seemingly unquantifiable things are always quantifiable to an extent in the world of football.\n\nMost successful dribblers since 2009\n\nAnd courtesy of the brilliant Twitter account that is @ThePopFoot, we're seldom left wanting for statistical comparisons that allow us to see the European men's game in different and exciting ways. The latest of which, it just so happens, sees the swashbuckling, take-on-all-comers approach of Messi take the spotlight as they have revealed the players with the most successful dribbles in single seasons since 2009. A fascinating measure not just of how much certain players go for the jugular by using dribbling, but also, simply put, how good or not they are at actually completing said slaloms past defenders. And let's just say that the results paint a quite astonishing picture in which the sheer brilliance of Messi's dribbling prowess couldn't be any clearer, so be sure to check out the top 20 down below:\n\n20.

    "Document": "Los Angeles Lakers 2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nWill LeBron and his son, Bronny, hoist the Larry O'Brien together?\nMassimo Marchiano\nWe've got the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25 to see how the game thinks the team will perform this year. Last year, the Lakers finished the season 47-35 and made the playoffs. However, they lost to the Denver Nuggets in the First Round in 5 games. Will they fare better this year? Let's find out.\nLos Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will go 48-34 in the regular season and make the playoffs. But before we show what happened in the postseason, let's see how they got there in the first place.\nOctober \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers' 2024-2025 season started on a rough note, with the team going 1-4 in October. The team performed well offensively, but the same couldn't be said about the defense. They managed to start the year 1-0 after beating Minnesota 111-103. But they instantly faced a fierce five-game losing streak that set them back.\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis led the team in minutes per game, points scored, and several other statistical categories. But as we can see, there'll need to be improvements from other players if they want to turn things around.\nNovember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe month of November was a bit better for the Lakers, but the team still struggled. As we mentioned, they suffered a loss to start the month, extending their losing streak to five. However, the Lakers went on to win seven of their next nine games to go 8-7. However, as soon as things were looking better, they lost four straight to end the month and end up being below .500 again.\nNothing was too different here than in October. While the team played well offensively, they allowed over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in a 14 game stretch. However, the season is still early and anything is possible.\nDecember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nBecause some games are still to be decided, a couple of games here do not reflect the actual 2024-2025 season. Instead of waiting for December to see the confirmed matchups, we just rocked with what NBA 2K25's MyNBA mode provided for us. The rest of the season does accurately reflect the real 2024-2024 schedule.\nAnyways, it was a better month for the Lakers who finally evened out their record. Additionally, the defense managed to buckle down and play better, though they still need to improve. However, thanks LeBron averaging over 27 points per game, the Lakers' offense is in good hands. We also got to see Bronny James play for the first time, though he only played for two minutes against the Kings near the end of the month.\nJanuary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers started off their New Year with a win to go above .500 for the first time this season. They went on to win two more games to extend their win streak to four games. Furthermore, this month saw the team win some important matchups, including a 1 point victory over the Celtics.\nIn fact, L.A. had three close games this month in which the winning team only won by 1 point. Another thing worth noting is the defensive improvement. This month they only allowed over 100 points in half of their matchups this month. It's not perfect, but the Lakers seemed to find a better rhythm in terms of defense.\nOverall, Davis and LeBron continue to be the superstars of this team. Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

(Photo by Lauren Sopourn/Getty Images)Getty Images\nDeandre Ayton and Matisse Thubulle returned to the rotation for the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night and were greeted rather rudely by the Miami Heat.\nThe Heat led 29-19 after the first quarter then went off for 45 points in the second quarter to lead 74-30 at halftime. The Blazers never remotely got back into the game and fell 142-82, the third most lopsided defeat in franchise history.\n\u201cIt was just a rough one,\u201d Blazers coach Chauncey Billups told reporters. \u201cIt was just a rough one for everybody.\u201d\nNot quite everybody. Ayton, who missed four games with elbow tendinitis, did all he could during a dreadful first half by scoring 16 points on 8-of-13 shooting.\n\u201cWe were happy to have him,\u201d Billups said. \u201cDA was his normal efficient self. He was very efficient and he was good on the glass. I\u2019m pretty sure he felt good just kind of getting back out there after being down for a while. I thought he did the best that he could.\u201d\nThe rest of the Blazers shot 10 of 32 (31.3%) from the field in the first half and 1 of 14 from three-point range while committing 10 turnovers.\nFor the game, the Blazers shot 39.8% from the field and 5 on 31 threes (16.1%). The Blazers committed 24 turnovers on the night.\nBillups briefly discussed how the Blazers started off playing clean basketball. They led 11-10 about four minutes into the game.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt happened pretty quick where we couldn\u2019t score. We couldn\u2019t get in the paint. We try to make a point, always, of getting the ball to the paint. Collapsing defenses and then create the chase, is what I call it.\u201d\nInstead, Miami prevented the Blazers from accomplishing their goal.\n\u201cTheir defense, they got physical,\u201d Billups said. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t get to the paint. And we just kind of settled, settled, settled. We turned it over. And we had a lot of what I call \u2018shooting turnovers,\u2019 which are just horrible shots that might as well be a turnover. And everything just kind of went bad at the same time.\u201d\nAyton, who played just over five minutes in the second half, finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 20 points with six assists but also committed seven turnovers.\nDalano Banton, who set a career high with 31 points during Wednesday\u2019s loss at Atlanta, shot just 5 of 19 against the Heat for 12 points.\nThe Heat did whatever they wanted on offense, shooting 59.3% from the field and 21 of 39 on threes (53.8%).\nThe Heat had six players with double-digit scoring, four over 20. Thomas Bryant led the Heat with 26 points off the bench. Terry Rozier scored 22 with six assists.\nWHAT IT MEANS\nThe Blazers (19-55) lost their ninth consecutive game to match their longest losing streak of the season. The Heat (40-33) remained in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, slightly ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (39-35).\nMONUMENTAL LOSS\nThe 60-point defeat is the third-worst in franchise history. Earlier this season, Portland lost 139-77 at Oklahoma City. That 62-point defeat ranks second all-time. The Blazers\u2019 worst loss in franchise history came Feb. 27, 1998, at Indiana by the score of 124-59 (65 points).\nMATISSE THYBULLE\nThe Blazers guard returned to action but didn\u2019t last long.

How much more did teams run? A lot. In 2022 there were 2,486 stolen bases in MLB, up slightly from 2,213 from 2021. Under the new rules in 2023 there were 3,503 stolen bases. So far in 2024 the league has swiped 3,268 bags. \nThe 2023 Cubs were in on that action, stealing 140 bags last season. That was good for eighth in the league. The 2024 Cubs are on a roughly similar trajectory with 131 stolen bases so far this season, good for seventh in the league. That\u2019s a respectable position relative to the rest of the league, but today I\u2019d like to make the case that the 2024 Cubs don\u2019t run nearly enough. The underlying numbers suggest they should be running more. A lot more.\nTo determine this I looked at some league-wide tendencies around stolen bases. I also looked at team success rates, some research on what an acceptable success rate should be and the Cubs individual player numbers.\nLet\u2019s start with team-level stolen base success rates and opportunities:\nTeams by Stolen Base Opportunities\nThe Cubs have had 1,911 stolen base chances according to Baseball Reference. They\u2019ve stolen 131 bases and been caught stealing 27 times, so they\u2019ve attempted a steal in 158 of those opportunities. Put in slightly different terms, they run 8.27 percent of the time that they have the chance to \u2014 which is good for eighth in baseball, right in line with their stolen base tally relative to the rest of the league.\nHowever, they\u2019ve been successful stealing bases 83 percent of the time, which puts them fifth in the majors in terms of stolen base success rate just a smidge behind the Brewers. You can see the above data sorted by success rate on attempts with two more decimal points pushed out, and resorted below:\nTeam stolen base success rate\nThat rate of 82.91 percent is good for keeping all of our blood pressure low by avoiding outs on the basepaths, but it is actually too high a threshold. Research from Tom Tango has indicated that the \u201cbreak-even\u201d point for attempting to steal a base is 75 percent:\nIn the soon-to-come Catcher Caught Stealing leaderboard on Savant, I am able to model each stolen base attempt to determine its expected caught stealing rate, based on where the runner is at the time the ball enters the catcher\u2019s glove. As we know, the breakeven point for a stolen base attempt is for the runner to be at least 75% successful. If the runner thinks they can be safe at least 75% of the time, they should go for it. That is of course a combination of reading the pitcher and beating the catcher.\nSimilarly, if a runner thinks they will be safe at most 60% of the time, they should never attempt to steal. In-between, and there\u2019s some other variables to consider.\nPut slightly differently, the Cubs are stealing a lot of bases relative to the rest of the league and their running rate is similar to their spot on the stolen base leaderboard relative to the rest of the league. However, they are probably leaving stolen bases (and the runners in scoring position that come with them) on the table. An 82.91 percent success rate is too cautious relative to the break-even point to attempt a steal.\nBut those are obviously not numbers that make sense at a team level. After all, the Cubs baseball team includes Pete Crow-Armstrong and his 99th percentile sprint speed, but it also includes Miguel Amaya and his 10th percentile sprint speed. Clearly, that 75 percent break even point has to be applied at a player level, not a team level. So I ran these same numbers for the Cubs players this season and you can see the results of that work below:\nCubs stolen base success rate 2024\nEleven Cubs have a stolen base success rate greater than 80 percent entering play on Friday. Furthermore, if you take a look at the individual results here, it is pretty clear that the Cubs stolen base success rate as a team was dragged down considerably by Christopher Morel\u2019s team-worst 58.33 percent success rate on the basepaths during his time with the Cubs. Pretty much every single member of the team who runs should run more with the possible exceptions of Seiya Suzuki (70 percent success rate) and Michael Busch (66.67 percent success rate).\nNow, some obvious small sample size caveats apply here. For example, Christian Bethancourt and his 55th percentile sprint speed should probably only be deployed selectively during the course of a season. He\u2019s got a 100 percent success rate in that same way Anthony Rizzo used to just gazelle his way to five to 10 stolen bases a season during his time with the Cubs (including a career-high 17 steals in 2015). Additionally, injury risk is real, and it could make sense that a guy like Nick Madrigal who\u2019s dealt with a number of hamstring injuries might need to cool it on the basepaths a bit, even though he\u2019s got a 100% success rate and the same sprint speed as Bethancourt.\nCaveats about guys who are clearly taking advantage of a particular battery or slowing down due to injury aside, the Cubs are leaving runs on the basepaths by having so many players who are well above the break-even point. While it\u2019s impossible to guess how many successful opportunities to move critical runs into scoring position or 90-feet from home have been left on the table by the Cubs in 2024, it seems pretty clear that there\u2019s room to run on the North Side of Chicago.\n\n\n    More From\n    \n        Bleed Cubbie Blue\n\n\n\n\n\n          Most Read\n        \n\n\nGambling Problem?

    "Summarized_Document": "One of the significant developments last season was the increase in stolen bases across MLB due to rule changes encouraging more running.

The Cubs have had 1,911 stolen base opportunities, attempting a steal in 158 of those chances (8.27%), ranking eighth in MLB. They have an 83% success rate, fifth in the majors, but this is too cautious compared to the 75% break-even point for attempting steals. At the player level, eleven Cubs have a success rate above 80%. Christopher Morel's 58.33% success rate has notably dragged down the team's overall rate. Players like Seiya Suzuki (70%) and Michael Busch (66.67%) might need to be more selective. Small sample sizes and injury risks, such as Nick Madrigal's hamstring issues, also play a role. Overall, the Cubs are likely leaving potential runs on the table by not attempting more steals, given their high success rates.",

    "Document": "\n\nArticles\n\n\nApril 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\nAccording to the Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the small but meaningful affordability gains seen since the start of the year were eclipsed by a renewed rise in mortgage rates, fueled by stronger-than-expected inflation and employment readings in March and April.\u00a0\nWhile the nation\u2019s median list price did not increase compared with last year due to an influx of more affordable and smaller homes, the typical home\u2019s price per square foot continued to grow, and, driven by rising rates, the cost to purchase a home once again outpaced wage growth after just a one-month reprieve in March.\nMeanwhile, sellers continued to list homes at a greater rate than last year. This has led to a promising increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. In response, the time a typical home spends on the market continues to be below pre-pandemic levels\u2014but the gap is shrinking. Sellers are also continuing to adjust to market conditions, with price reductions remaining above the previous year\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nHome listing availability continues to improve in April\nThere were 30.4% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in April compared with the same time in 2023, marking the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.\nFor the first four months of this year, the inventory of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020. However, while inventory this April is much improved compared with the previous three years, it is still down 35.9% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. This is a slight improvement compared with last month\u2019s 37.9% gap, as inventory continues to slowly improve toward normalcy.\n\nIn April, as in the previous two months, the growth in homes particularly priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range outpaced all other price categories, as home inventory in this range grew by 41.0% compared with last year, surpassing even last month\u2019s high 30.5% growth rate. As we show in the next section, this increase is primarily fueled by a greater availability of smaller and more affordable homes in the South.\nThe total number of homes for sale, including homes that were under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared with last year, growing on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row after ending a seven-month streak of annual total listing declines.\u00a0\n\nThe number of homes under contract but not yet sold (pending listings) increased by 6.3%, which is similar to last month\u2019s 6.2% growth rate. After reports of unexpectedly persistent inflation, mortgage rates increased in April on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely push back its first cut to the primary policy rate, which was originally expected in June of this year.\nNext month, we may see the growth in pending listings slow, and as pending home sales are an early indicator of the direction of existing-home sales, it is possible that sales may decelerate further in April and May, after dipping 4.3% in March.\n\nHowever, providing a boost to overall inventory, which has been a drag on sales the past couple of years, sellers turned out in higher numbers this April as newly listed homes were 12.2% above last year\u2019s levels, matching last month\u2019s growth rate. This marked the sixth month of increasing listing activity after a 17-month streak of declines. However, sellers, of whom roughly three-quarters plan to also purchase a home, have been fairly rate-sensitive over this past year.\nIf mortgage rates remain elevated over the next few months, the housing market may see a return to the holding pattern of scarce inventory, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For buyers, that could mean fewer opportunities for finding their ideal home as summer approaches.\u00a0\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends\nThe South leads the way in more affordable inventory growth\nThe South has been largely driving the increase in availability of homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range, and the increase in availability of homes overall. Home listings located in the South made up more than half (56.6%) of available inventory in April 2024, up from 52.0% last year and 47.7% in April 2019.\nIn April, all four regions saw active inventory grow over the previous year. The South saw listings grow by 43.0%, while inventory grew by 27.4% in the West, 17.6% in the Midwest, and only 4.0% in the Northeast.\nThe inventory of homes for sale increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros compared with last year. In seven large metros, inventory was above pre-pandemic levels. Metros that saw the most inventory growth included Tampa (+69.5%), Orlando (+64.2%), and Jacksonville (+59.1%). In large Florida metros, the inventory growth was primarily driven by an increase in the availability of attached homes (condos, townhomes, or row homes).\u00a0\nDespite higher inventory growth compared with last year, most metros still had a lower level of inventory compared with pre-pandemic years. Among the 50 largest metro areas, only seven saw higher levels of inventory in April compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. However, this is up from only four metros last month. The top metros that saw inventory surpass pre-pandemic levels were Austin (+28.9%), San Antonio (+27.4%), and Denver (+15.2%).\nThe South saw newly listed homes increase the most compared with last year\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South, by 19.7%, whereas new inventory grew by 18.4% in the West, 7.5% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.\nIn April, 48 of the 50 largest metros saw new listings increase over the previous year, but only three saw more newly listed homes than the typical April from 2017 to 2019. The metros that saw the largest growth in newly listed homes included Seattle (+46.5%), San Jose (+40.6%), and Austin (+36.1%), while Detroit (-3.8%) and Cincinnati (-1.6%) saw new listings decline. Only Austin (+18.8%), San Antonio (+2.6%), and Jacksonville (+1.6%) saw more new listings enter the market this April compared with typical pre-pandemic levels.\nHomes are spending slightly more time on the market compared with last year\u00a0\nThe typical home spent 47 days on the market this April, which is 1 day more than the same time last year and a week less than the average April from 2017 to 2019. April was the first month since September 2023 to see homes spend more time on the market than the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the gap between time on the market this year and typical pre-pandemic levels, while still present, is shrinking as inventory grows. The gap shrank from 12 days last month to just seven days this month.\n\nRegional and metro area time on the market trends\nThis month, not all regions saw the inventory of homes for sale spend less time on the market than last year. In the South, where the growth in home inventory has been the largest, the typical home spent two days more on the market in April compared with last year. However, in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, homes are still spending two days less on the market than last April.\nWhile all regions were still seeing time on the market below pre-pandemic levels, in the West, homes are spending only one day less on the market compared with the typical April from 2017 to 2019. Time on the market was nine days less than pre-pandemic levels in the South, 11 days less in the Midwest, and 15 days less in the Northeast.\nMeanwhile, time on the market decreased compared with last year in 26 of the 50 largest metro areas this April, down from 41 markets last month. It decreased the most in Kansas City (-15 days), Las Vegas (-11 days), and Raleigh (-10 days). Time on the market increased compared with last year in 21 of the 50 largest metros, including Hartford (+9 days), Denver (+8 days), Pittsburgh, and Phoenix (+5 days each). Ten predominantly Western markets saw homes spend more time on the market than typical 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic timing, including Phoenix (+11 days), Seattle (+8 days), Denver, and Portland (+7 days each).\nThe median list price remained stable compared with last April, but the price per square foot continues to rise\nThe national median list price continued to increase seasonally, to $430,000 in April compared with $424,900 in March, and the median list price remained stable compared with the same time last year, when it was also $430,000.\u00a0\nCompared with last year, sellers are inching back to list more small and affordable homes, particularly in the South, and this change in the mix of available homes has kept the nation\u2019s median list price stable.\nWhile the median list price remained relatively unchanged, on an adjusted per-square-foot basis, the median list price grew by 3.8%, as homes continue to retain their value despite increased inventory compared with last year.\nMeanwhile, higher mortgage rates compared with last April still increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $148 (6.9%) compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $5,900, to $116,000, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.\u00a0\nFor the past several months, growth in the monthly cost to purchase a home was slowing. However, the renewed mortgage rate growth seen in April has once again fueled an increase in the growth rate of the cost to purchase a home (+6.9% year over year). In March, average hourly earnings for private employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grew by 4.1% annually. However, this increase is no longer outpacing the increase in the cost to purchase a home as it did last month.\n\nWhile the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% in April of last year to 15.5% this year, the overall share of inventory is no longer historically high, as the share dipped back below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2017 and 2018 (15.8%, respectively).\nLast month we noted that sellers were adjusting to an increase in more competitive home listings. Indeed, a Realtor.com survey also showed that sellers have more realistic market expectations this year, with fewer potential sellers expecting a bidding war or sale within a week or sale above their asking price compared with last year. Yet while sellers continue to adjust expectations and are cutting prices at a greater rate than last year, when inventory levels were historically low, historical data shows that their behavior in adjusting prices is not unusual for pre-pandemic norms.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends\nIn April, listing prices remained stable on a year-over-year basis in the South (-0.1%), where competitive home inventory has grown the most, but prices continued to increase in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%) compared with the same time last year. On an adjusted per-square-foot basis, prices in all regions grew similarly, by 3.9% to 5.2%, as soft median list price growth in the South was driven by a larger inventory of affordable, smaller homes available for sale.\nThe median list price in Buffalo (+14.0%), Cleveland (+13.4%), and Rochester (+11.4%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. Meanwhile, 21 metros saw their median list price decline compared with last year, up from 18 last month. The metros included Miami (-10.7%), San Francisco (-10.7%), and Kansas City (-8.3%). However, on a price-per-square-foot basis, listing prices in Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City declined only by 6.6%, 2.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, as the mix of listing inventory consisted of smaller homes relative to the previous year.\nNotably, 34 of the 50 largest metro areas required a household income of more than $100,000 to afford the median-priced home at current interest rates, and six even required a household income of more than $200,000. Midwestern metros were commonly among the 16 remaining metro areas that required a household income of less than $100,000. The most affordable by this measure were Pittsburgh ($67,000), Detroit ($69,000), and Cleveland ($71,000). The most expensive metros were predominantly in the West, including San Jose ($361,000), Los Angeles ($298,000), and San Diego ($259,000).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that recent price and interest rate trends are affecting the income required to buy a home differently. In six markets, the median home listing price has fallen enough over the past year to offset rising mortgage rates and the income needed to buy a home has dropped. These markets were Miami (-6.2% required income year over year), San Francisco (-5.5%), Kansas City (-3.6%), Denver (-2.9%), Oklahoma City (-2.2%), and Seattle (-0.6%). In 15 markets, the median list price has declined, but rising mortgage rates have pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. These markets included San Jose (+1.1% required income year over year), Raleigh (+2.7%), and Cincinnati (+2.7%). Yet in the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates have combined to push required incomes higher, and in 14 of the 50 largest metros, the required income grew by double digits compared with last year. The top three metros that saw the required income increase the most were Buffalo (+20.0%), Cleveland (+19.3%), and Pittsburgh (+17.1%).\nThe share of price reductions was up compared with last year in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared with last April, up from 34 in March. Portland saw the greatest increase (+9.7 percentage points), followed by Tampa (+8.8 percentage points) and Jacksonville (+7.3 percentage points).\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics vs. Pre-Pandemic 2017\u201319\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Housing Overview of the 50 Largest Metros\u00a0\n* The required income to purchase a home, assuming an affordability price-to-income ratio of 30%, a 20% down payment, a 30-year term, a 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and local tax and insurance rates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nRealtor.com housing data as of April 2024.

    "Summarized_Document": "April 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\n\nAccording to Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the affordability gains seen earlier in the year were overshadowed by rising mortgage rates due to stronger-than-expected inflation and employment figures in March and April. The national median list price remained stable compared to last year, but the price per square foot continued to grow. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate than last year, leading to an increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. The time a typical home spends on the market is still below pre-pandemic levels, but the gap is shrinking.\n\nHome listing availability improved in April, with 30.4% more homes actively for sale compared to April 2023. This marked the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth. Inventory in April was at its highest level since 2020 but still down 35.9% compared to 2017-2019 levels. Homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range saw the most significant growth, with inventory in this range increasing by 41.0% compared to last year. The total number of homes for sale, including those under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared to last year.\n\nPending listings increased by 6.3%, similar to last month's 6.2% growth rate. Mortgage rates increased in April, likely delaying the Federal Reserve's first policy rate cut. This may slow the growth in pending listings and existing-home sales in the coming months. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate, with newly listed homes 12.2% above last year's levels, marking the sixth month of increasing listing activity.\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends showed the South leading in affordable inventory growth, with listings growing by 43.0%. The West saw a 27.4% increase, the Midwest 17.6%, and the Northeast 4.0%. Inventory increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros, with Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville seeing the most growth. Despite higher inventory growth, most metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South by 19.7%, followed by the West (18.4%), Midwest (7.5%), and Northeast (2.9%). Seattle, San Jose, and Austin saw the largest growth in newly listed homes. Homes spent slightly more time on the market compared to last year, with the typical home spending 47 days on the market in April, one day more than last year.\n\nThe national median list price remained stable at $430,000, the same as last year. However, the price per square foot grew by 3.8%. Higher mortgage rates increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by $148 (6.9%) compared to last year, raising the required household income to $116,000. The percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% last year to 15.5% this year.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends showed stable listing prices in the South (-0.1%) but increases in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%). Buffalo, Cleveland, and Rochester saw the biggest increases in median list prices, while Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City saw declines. The required household income to afford the median-priced home exceeded $100,000 in 34 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the most expensive metros in the West.\n\nRecent price and interest rate trends affected the income required to buy a home differently across markets. In six markets, the median home listing price fell enough to offset rising mortgage rates, reducing the required income. In 15 markets, rising mortgage rates pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. In the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates combined to push required incomes higher, with 14 metros seeing double-digit increases in required income compared to last year.\n\nThe share of price reductions increased in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points).

    "Summarized_Document": "The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released new residential construction statistics for March 2024. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for building permits in March was 1,458,000, a 4.3% decrease from February's revised rate of 1,523,000 but a 1.5% increase from March 2023's rate of 1,437,000. Single-family authorizations were at 973,000, down 5.7% from February's revised figure of 1,032,000. Authorizations for buildings with five units or more were at 433,000.Privately-owned housing starts in March were at a SAAR of 1,321,000, a 14.7% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,549,000 and a 4.3% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,380,000. Single-family housing starts were at 1,022,000, down 12.4% from February's revised figure of 1,167,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 290,000.Housing completions in March were at a SAAR of 1,469,000, a 13.5% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,698,000 and a 3.9% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,528,000. Single-family housing completions were at 947,000, down 10.5% from February's revised rate of 1,058,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 502,000.The data also includes explanatory notes on the interpretation of changes in the statistics, highlighting that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics can be irregular and may require several months to establish an underlying trend. The statistics are based on a non-probability sample and are subject to nonsampling error. The total quantity response rate for these estimates is 75.9%.The next release is scheduled for May 16, 2024. Additional information on the survey methodology can be found on the Census Bureau's website.",

    "Summarized_Document": "The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released new residential construction statistics for March 2024. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for building permits in March was 1,458,000, a 4.3% decrease from February's revised rate of 1,523,000 but a 1.5% increase from March 2023's rate of 1,437,000. Single-family authorizations were at 973,000, down 5.7% from February's revised figure of 1,032,000. Authorizations for buildings with five units or more were at 433,000.Privately-owned housing starts in March were at a SAAR of 1,321,000, a 14.7% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,549,000 and a 4.3% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,380,000. Single-family housing starts were at 1,022,000, down 12.4% from February's revised figure of 1,167,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 290,000.Housing completions in March were at a SAAR of 1,469,000, a 13.5% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,698,000 and a 3.9% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,528,000. Single-family housing completions were at 947,000, down 10.5% from February's revised rate of 1,058,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 502,000.The data also includes explanatory notes on the interpretation of changes in the statistics, highlighting that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics can be irregular and may require several months to establish an underlying trend. The statistics are based on a non-probability sample and are subject to nonsampling error. The total quantity response rate for these estimates is 75.9%.The next release is scheduled for May 16, 2024. Additional information on the survey methodology can be found on the Census Bureau's website.",

    "Summarized_Document": "The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released new residential construction statistics for March 2024. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for building permits in March was 1,458,000, a 4.3% decrease from February's revised rate of 1,523,000 but a 1.5% increase from March 2023's rate of 1,437,000. Single-family authorizations were at 973,000, down 5.7% from February's revised figure of 1,032,000. Authorizations for buildings with five units or more were at 433,000.Privately-owned housing starts in March were at a SAAR of 1,321,000, a 14.7% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,549,000 and a 4.3% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,380,000. Single-family housing starts were at 1,022,000, down 12.4% from February's revised figure of 1,167,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 290,000.Housing completions in March were at a SAAR of 1,469,000, a 13.5% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,698,000 and a 3.9% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,528,000. Single-family housing completions were at 947,000, down 10.5% from February's revised rate of 1,058,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 502,000.The data also includes explanatory notes on the interpretation of changes in the statistics, highlighting that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics can be irregular and may require several months to establish an underlying trend. The statistics are based on a non-probability sample and are subject to nonsampling error. The total quantity response rate for these estimates is 75.9%.The next release is scheduled for May 16, 2024. Additional information on the survey methodology can be found on the Census Bureau's website.",

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website. Rent prices listed are averages and may not reflect the cost of specific units. Rental prices can vary depending on factors like size, location, amenities, and availability.\nHow Much Is Rent for a Studio Apartment in San Diego?\nOn average, expect to pay around $2,545 per month for a studio apartment in San Diego.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 1-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nThe average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in San Diego is approximately $3,106 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 2-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nIn San Diego, a 2-bedroom apartment typically rents for around $3,926 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 3-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nA 3-bedroom apartment in San Diego will cost, on average, $4,754 per month.\nTransportation in San Diego\nSan Diego residents have a few popular choices when it comes to getting around the city, and the best option often depends on the trip and personal preferences:\nMTS: The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) operates a network of buses and trolleys that cover a large portion of the city. It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work. The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north. This is a great option for residents who live along the coast or want a scenic ride.\nCar: While public transportation is good, many San Diegans still rely on cars for the ultimate flexibility. Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness. Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website. Rent prices listed are averages and may not reflect the cost of specific units. Rental prices can vary depending on factors like size, location, amenities, and availability.\nHow Much Is Rent for a Studio Apartment in San Diego?\nOn average, expect to pay around $2,545 per month for a studio apartment in San Diego.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 1-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nThe average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in San Diego is approximately $3,106 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 2-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nIn San Diego, a 2-bedroom apartment typically rents for around $3,926 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 3-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nA 3-bedroom apartment in San Diego will cost, on average, $4,754 per month.\nTransportation in San Diego\nSan Diego residents have a few popular choices when it comes to getting around the city, and the best option often depends on the trip and personal preferences:\nMTS: The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) operates a network of buses and trolleys that cover a large portion of the city. It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work. The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north. This is a great option for residents who live along the coast or want a scenic ride.\nCar: While public transportation is good, many San Diegans still rely on cars for the ultimate flexibility. Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness. Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north.

Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

With 6 to 9 months of inventory, the market is called Balanced, and home values remain stable with slight decreases or increases possible. Below 6 months is called a Seller\u2019s Market, as home prices slightly increase due to demand.

The higher the rate, the more it costs for a buyer to buy. When interest rates rise, it has the same effect as a seller raising his price and fewer homes sell because mortgage payments are higher. Conversely, when rates decrease more buyers qualify to purchase and home sales usually increase.

    "Document": "Subway and bus ridership for 2023\n2023 ridership reflects continued growth\nIn 2023, subway ridership posted a 14% annual increase to 1.15 billion annual paid rides, hitting the billion-ride milestone six weeks earlier than in 2022.\nRidership patterns have shifted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with discretionary travel becoming more popular than commutation travel. Increased telecommuting and more flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels. At 77%, weekend recovery is higher than the weekday recovery of 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023, as the MTA continues to combat subway fare evasion.\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level. This was slower than the 11% growth observed in 2022. Significant factors contributing to slower growth include rising bus fare evasion and the introduction of a fare-free pilot program on five bus routes starting in September 2023.\nOverview of New York City\u2019s transit system\nWe operate the largest public transportation agency in North America and one of the largest in the world.\nThe subway has a daily ridership of approximately 3.6 million and buses have a daily ridership of 1.4 million, representing 68% and 63%, respectively, of pre-pandemic ridership levels.\nOur system includes:\nHow we calculate ridership\nSubways\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nBuses\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nAverage weekday, Saturday, and Sunday ridership includes every weekday, Saturday, and Sunday in the year, except major holidays and days when the subway system was closed or operated fare-free.\nAverage weekend ridership is the two-day sum of average Saturday plus average Sunday ridership.

Note that our table lists 424 stations. We combined ridership data for station complexes, where stations are connected by transfer passageways. (We can't accurately allocate ridership to each station in a complex.) For example, the 14 St\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u00a0station is combined with the 8 Av\u00a0\u200b\u00a0station.\nThe station names and lines stopping at each station reflect service at the end of 2023.\nIn our spreadsheet, stations are listed alphabetically by borough, and the rankings are by 2023 ridership. The \u201csystemwide adjustment\u201d accounts for miscellaneous ridership and other adjustments that are not allocated by station.\nIn our tables, stations that were temporarily closed (either fully or partially) are denoted with asterisks; go to the \u201cClosures\u201d tab for the closure dates. For these stations, zero ridership was included in the averages for any days when the station was closed, except for the days when the entire subway was closed or fare-free.\nSummary of bus ridership (New York City Transit)\nYear\nAverage weekday\nAverage Saturday\nAverage Sunday\nAverage weekend\nAnnual total\n2018\n1,811,605\n1,122,626\n868,057\n1,990,683\n569,361,220\n2019\n1,770,394\n1,108,809\n847,931\n1,956,740\n557,036,504\n2020\n980,374\n671,835\n532,002\n1,203,837\n316,768,454\n2021\n984,865\n646,302\n482,090\n1,128,392\n311,893,583\n2022\n1,094,415\n662,179\n523,178\n1,185,357\n343,092,963\n2023\n1,082,428\n670,755\n535,911\n1,206,666\n340,766,398\nSummary of bus ridership (MTA Bus Company)\nYear\nAverage weekday\nAverage Saturday\nAverage Sunday\nAverage weekend\nAnnual total\n2018\n392,617\n224,751\n170,892\n395,643\n121,448,276\n2019\n388,075\n228,364\n171,762\n400,126\n120,551,580\n2020\n207,042\n132,387\n99,713\n232,100\n65,655,990\n2021\n228,425\n142,112\n102,744\n244,856\n71,431,466\n2022\n268,124\n150,399\n113,157\n263,556\n82,609,386\n2023\n279,247\n159,451\n121,069\n280,520\n86,216,666\nTop 10 busiest bus routes by ridership in 2023\nRank\nRoute\nBorough\nRidership\n1\nM15 Local/SBS\nManhattan\n10,468,682\n2\nQ58\nQueens\n7,119,884\n3\nB6\nBrooklyn\n6,049,383\n4\nBx12 Local/SBS\nBronx\n5,900,063\n5\nB82 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,647,706\n6\nB46 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,547,520\n7\nB44 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,468,965\n8\nQ27\nQueens\n5,414,302\n9\nB41\nBrooklyn\n4,759,664\n10\nQ44\nQueens\n4,715,292\nAbout our bus data\nLocal routes begin with one or two letters corresponding to the major borough of operation (B = Brooklyn, Bx = Bronx, M = Manhattan, Q = Queens, S = Staten Island).

July 6, 1990\nWhen it comes to transportation in San Francisco, the cable cars and streetcars understandably get all the glory. But the bus has played an important role in San Francisco's history too. There's a folder in the photo archives devoted to San Francisco buses. The earliest one dates from 1918, showing the first gasoline bus introduced by The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. It crossed Golden Gate Park. There aren't any bus photos in the folder from the Twenties or Thirties, I had to get them from another source. But, every other decade was well represented.\u00a0\nThe photo from 1918 was used in an article that was published in 1962. Fifty years earlier, San Francisco launched as what Muni describes as \"the first major, publicly owned, land-based transit agency in the United States.\" On that day, an open end streetcar, which came to be known as \"Old Number One,\" slid smoothly and sleekly out of the barn and headed east down Geary Street at noon, on December 28.\"\u00a0\nMore For You\nRare unseen downtown San Francisco photos show city life in the 1930s and 1940s\nSave the Palace of Fine Arts? In the 60s, SF wasn't so sure.\nFirst US stewardesses, paper dresses and flight attendants a go go\nFifty years later, \"Old Number One\" was dusted off as the highlight of Muni's \"Golden Week.\" It was stated that the purpose of the celebration was to note that the transit system \"which began as a 10-streetcar, one-line affair,\" had then blossomed into a thriving 835-vehicle schedule that carried 670,000 San Franciscans each week.\u00a0According to the American Public Transportation Association, Muni now has about 57 million riders a year.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nBy 1962, the fares had only gone from 5 cents to 15 cents. Today, that same ride will cost adults $2.25. In 1912, San Francisco's mayor, \"Sunny Jim\" Rolph, placed the first nickel in Muni's first coin box. The Chronicle article at the time stated that the coin was one of the first 40 minted at the Old Mint at Fifth and Mission Streets.\u00a0\nMayor Rolph hoped the launching of the transit system would be without much fanfare. But, by the time the streetcar reached Market Street, just off Geary, it was met by a mob of about 50,000 people, almost causing a riot. Souvenir hunters placed coins on the tracks to flatten them. In the first 12 hours, fifteen thousand people jammed onto the 10 new streetcars, earning Muni a handsome $750.\u00a0\nThe video below shows what Market Street was like in 1912, just prior to the Muni's founding.\nBob Bragman is a producer for SFGATE.

This includes a new ChatBot for improved customer service, ongoing work with our transit partners at Metra, Pace and RTA to deliver innovative fare products, plus a new, dedicated program that will provide pre-loaded Ventra Cards to victims and survivors of domestic abuse.\n\u201cI deeply believe that an examination of an agency\u2019s budget is all that is required to understand who and what it prioritizes. The CTA\u2019s proposed 2024 budget puts a high premium on providing the highest levels of service, customer comfort, modernization and equity,\u201d said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. \u201cI am pleased with the continued progress and positive trends that CTA continues to make, but we still have work to do to provide the service that I believe our customers deserve and expect. I am committed to returning more scheduled service to our bus and rail systems in 2024.\u201d\nCTA ridership grew steadily throughout 2023, reaching a pandemic-era high of more than 25.83. million rides during the month of September. Overall system-wide ridership for 2023 is forecasted to finish 12 percent higher than in 2022. Ridership is projected to increase further in 2024, approximately 5.7 percent over the 2023 forecasted ridership.\nThe continued strengthening of CTA\u2019s workforce is critical to further improving the delivery of its services.\nIn 2023, the CTA made tremendous progress toward addressing this issue, hosting seven job fairs that attracted more than 3,000 potential employees, while hiring hundreds of new workers into a variety of positions. As a result of CTA\u2019s ongoing aggressive recruiting efforts, it has already surpassed its goal of hiring 700 new bus operators in 2023, and anticipates hiring more than 900 bus operators by the end of the year.\nCTA is also on track to hire approximately 100 bus mechanics in 2023, which is more than double the normal rate. On the rail side, almost 100 flaggers will have been trained and transitioned into rail operator positions by the end of 2023, which is significantly more rail operators trained than the number of rail operators historically trained in a year.\nOverall, CTA is projecting to hire more than 2,000 new employees for the current year, also far exceeding the 1,200 annual hiring norm. CTA will continue to plan, monitor, and respond to the shifting employment landscape to meet its people and service needs. As such, CTA anticipates continued optimization of its service schedules to reflect its growing workforce\u2013additional service is expected to be added in 2024.\nSince the start of the pandemic, federal funding has been crucial to allow transit agencies across the country, including the CTA, to maintain their operations. Federal funding from the American Rescue Plan will help the CTA close a projected $473 million budget gap in 2024\u2014and allow the agency to continue providing as much service as possible with its available workforce. Despite the financial challenges, the CTA continues to look for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively, and to best serve the region.\n\u201cWhile more and improved funding and investment is unquestionably the most important issue facing CTA finances, our number one priority is always the people who take hundreds of millions of rides on our system every year. It is incumbent upon us to work diligently to find better ways to serve them and improve their travel experience.\u201d Carter added.\nThe CTA\u2019s 2024-2028 Capital Improvement Program\u2014which is separate from the agency\u2019s operating budget\u2014calls for $3.61 billion in projects over the next five years. This budget reflects CTA\u2019s ongoing commitment towards the modernization and improvement of its physical infrastructure\u2014tracks, rail stations, buses and trains, facilities and technologies. Among the many important investments is the Red Line Extension, which will extend the CTA\u2019s busiest rail line to the southern City limits and will provide greatly improved transit access and connectivity to the Far South Side of Chicago.\nOther capital projects to continue or begin in 2024 include:\nMore information on the proposed 2024 budget is at transitchicago.com/finance/.\nA public hearing will be held on Thursday, November 9, 2023 at 6:00 p.m. at CTA headquarters located at 567 W.

Additional increases are planned in 2024 and 2025 to pay for solar projects.\nCommission Chairman Gary Clark noted receiving more than 1,100 emails from consumers about the proposal and indicated he had concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and a electric-vehicle charging station program. But, Clark said he understands the need for clean energy investments and pointed to other benefits of the settlement, such as predictability in rates.\n\"There are things within that predictability that I think give homeowners, give businesses some assurity going into the future, that they have a stable rate climate, they can do their budgeting accordingly,\" Clark said. \"I think that is a very positive, very positive thing.\"\nCommissioners also added a requirement for annual reports on the company's expansion of infrastructure for electric vehicles.\nFPL reached the rate settlement in August with the state Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Three other parties later signed on.\nThe rate plan incorporates the merger of FPL and Northwest Florida's Gulf Power. That merger formally took effect Jan. 1, but it came with issues such as the utilities having widely different rates.\nIn a prepared statement, FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy said the deal benefits all customers by keeping \"bills low\" while \"accelerating investments in clean energy.\"\n\"Florida is a rapidly growing state on the front lines of climate change, and our customers deserve bold, decisive, long-term actions as we continue building a more resilient and sustainable energy future all of us can depend on, including future generations,\" Silagy said in the statement.\nFor customers outside of Northwest Florida who use 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month, bills are expected to go from the current $101.70 to $113.85 in January. Those bills would increase to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. In addition to base rates, the totals include costs for such things as natural gas for power plants.\nThe plan uses what is described as a \"transition rider\" to take into account the substantially different rates that FPL and Gulf have charged. The result will leave Northwest Florida customers paying more than FPL customers in other areas.\nUnder the plan, Gulf residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt hours a month will see their bills go from the current $129.24 to $137.49 in January. They then would see the bills decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024 and $126.47 in 2025.\nFPL filed a base-rate proposal in March and then negotiated the settlement, which trimmed the original proposal by about $428 million. The settlement, in part, reduced a targeted return on equity --- a closely watched measure of profitability --- from 11.5 percent to 10.6 percent.\n\"I believe that all of the parties are to be commended for the outstanding job that you did, negotiating on behalf of the folks that you represented,\" Clark said. \"It's pretty obvious some of you did a little better job than others.\"\nBut the settlement was opposed by Floridians Against Increased Rates, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising, which have members who are residential customers of FPL.\nThose groups argued, in part, that the plan will require residential and small business customers to subsidize the rates of large commercial and industrial customers.\n\"To put it succinctly, a settlement that includes so much wasteful spending to double down on fossil fuels, that transfers so much wealth from residential customers to commercial and industrial customers, and that literally leaves residential customers worse off than in FPL's original proposal, cannot be in the public interest,\" attorneys for the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising wrote in an Oct. 11 brief. \"This 'settlement' gives FPL everything they want --- and more.\"\nThe agreement addresses a series of solar-energy issues, which FPL said will support the development of 16 million solar panels at more than 50 sites across Florida. FPL has been operating under a base-rate settlement that took effect in January 2017 and will end in December.\n(\u00a92021 CBS Local Media. All rights reserved.

For the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA, 10% annual savings would amount to $547 in savings per year.\n\n                How much can you save by subscribing to a community solar farm in San Francisco, CA?\n            \nElectric bills in San Francisco, CA\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh.\nElectric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either\n                using less electricity\n                or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity.\nThe average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years!\nAssuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases.\nInstalling solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years.\n                Calculating your savings from investing in solar\n                is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment.

In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh.\nElectric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either\n                using less electricity\n                or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity.\nThe average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years!\nAssuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases.\nInstalling solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years.\n                Calculating your savings from investing in solar\n                is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment.

For decades, the industry has been an important contributor to Europe\u2019s economic growth, innovation, and prosperity, accounting for almost 7 percent of the region\u2019s GDP and being directly or indirectly responsible for employing almost 14 million people.1\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, European Commission, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d ACEA, September 1, 2022; 25 actions for a successful restart of the EU\u2019s automotive sector, CLEPA, May 2020. The industry also carries significant symbolic weight; taglines such as \u201cMade in Germany,\u201d \u201cItalian car design,\u201d \u201cEuro NCAP for Saver Cars,\u201d and \u201cBritish racing\u201d have come to stand for European innovation and craftsmanship.\nHowever, the status quo is being challenged and the industry faces massive ongoing transformations, such as the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains and a shift in focus from hardware to differentiation through software. This dynamic has allowed new entrants in Europe and abroad\u2014especially in China, the largest automotive market in the world2\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d China - Country Commercial Guide, International Trade Administration, updated April 7, 2023.\u2014to disrupt the market and win market share. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports for the first time, with exports of about 3.0 million vehicles, in contrast to Germany\u2019s 2.6 million.3\u201cWhat if Germany stopped making cars?,\u201d Economist, July 31, 2023. These transformative forces overlap with a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, including rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. All of these factors have greatly affected the European auto industry and make navigating the sector\u2019s transformation challenging. A prosperous future for the European automotive industry will therefore depend on how well and quickly it responds and how European stakeholders can shape the necessary conditions for future success. The need for action is urgent.\nTo that end, we have sketched a road map that covers seven areas. Executing on this plan will require action from a variety of industry stakeholders. Speedy action from automotive companies will be important, but the regional ecosystem, including the public sector and multiple adjacent sectors, will need to participate in shaping a level playing field and a fertile environment for the future of the European automotive industry.\nA multidecade success story\nThe European automotive industry has been an engine powering prosperity and growth, employment, and innovation and has contributed to Europe\u2019s image and perception on the global stage (Exhibit 1).\nAn economic powerhouse for the region, the automotive industry contributed about 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exports in 2022.425 actions for a successful restart, May 2020; \u201cEuropean Union exports by category,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023. The sector\u2019s more than 17,300 companies form a network of OEMs and suppliers of all tiers.5\u201cImpact of electromobility on the European automotive industry,\u201d HitHorizons, February 21, 2022. Significantly, the industry directly or indirectly employs more than 6 percent of the region\u2019s workforce,6\u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d September 1, 2022. creating positive spillover effects outside the sector.\nThe automotive industry has also been a nexus of innovation. Technical champions and small and medium-size businesses within the ecosystem have continuously innovated, especially in the areas of combustion engine powertrain, chassis, safety systems, and exterior and interior design. Indeed, about 30 percent of global automotive patents originated from European countries, the most of any region.7McKinsey analysis based on data about automotive industry global patents from IPlytics and Innography by Clarivate, accessed June 12, 2023. Significant investments into research and development have helped European automakers introduce new technologies that have contributed to major advances in sustainability and safety by improving fuel economies and reducing emissions, noise, and accidents.\nProgress and investment in the European auto industry over the past several decades have contributed to Europe\u2019s global image. German engineering is widely touted,8Dave Taylor, \u201cWho owns the idea of German engineering among German car brands?,\u201d Taylor Brand Group, April 8, 2013. and our research suggests many European automakers are considered front-runners in sustainability, with some of the most ambitious targets around electric vehicles (EVs), decarbonization, and safety.\nThanks in part to this work, the brand value of the ten largest European auto companies is conservatively estimated at a combined \u20ac200 billion; five of the ten most valuable car brands worldwide are European.9\u201cLargest automakers by market capitalization,\u201d CompaniesMarketcap.com, accessed August 15, 2023; brand value analysis based on 2023 data on European automotive companies from Brand Finance, accessed June 20, 2023; Alex Haigh, \u201c2022 Automotive industry trends: Doubling down on electric and connected cars,\u201d Brand Finance, February 22, 2022. The grand challenge now is to maintain and build on these assets in the face of profound and accelerating change.\nDisruption and transformation\nThe historic strengths and recently reported record margins of European OEMs may create a false sense of safety for the industry. Accelerated disruptions around electrification, software, and new competitive pressures loom.\nSubstantial market disruptions have been observed in other industries, with serious outcomes. For instance, European manufacturers lost more than 90 percent of their share of the smartphone market in just six years.10\u201cGlobal market share held by Nokia smartphones from 1st quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2013,\u201d Statista Research Department, July 25, 2013. McKinsey analysis shows that leading players in the film camera industry lost similar market share over nine years.\nMarket share data suggest that European OEMs\u2019 leadership position is being challenged as new entrants, especially from China, gain traction. Our analysis also suggests that European market conditions for local development and production are becoming less competitive. Analysis from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility shows that since 2019, European incumbents have lost six percentage points of market share in their home market and five percentage points in China. Meanwhile, Chinese OEMs are gaining ground in both China and Europe, reaching 45 percent market share in their home market in 2022 and octupling their market share in Europe between 2020 and 2022.11McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. This dynamic is even more apparent in battery electric vehicles (BEVs): new EV-focused entrants hold 51 percent of the global BEV market (Exhibit 2).12McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. Besides market share, European OEMs also face the challenge of running profitable BEV businesses.\nA more detailed look at different segments offers a more nuanced picture of the industry. In the premium segment\u2014home turf for many European OEMs\u2014European OEMs still hold 71 percent of global sales. But this segment is also becoming more challenging to hold: newcomers claimed 18 percent of the premium market in 2022.13McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023.\nThis shake-up stems from the fast pace of change in the industry. The transition from internal-combustion-engine (ICE) to zero-emissions vehicles is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80 percent per year since 2020. McKinsey analysis suggests that many global mobility markets will reach near-total EV penetration by the mid-2030s. In response, European OEMs have announced ambitious electrification plans to launch more than 150 EV models through 2030, according to McKinsey analysis.\nThe EV transition drives the industry\u2019s emphasis away from hardware toward software and digital. According to our analysis, EV consumers are more than twice as likely to switch brands for better in-vehicle technology, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features and connectivity services. Our research shows that successful automakers are developing cars defined by software, resulting in a tripling of software content per vehicle since 2015.\nWith electrified, software-defined cars becoming the norm, semiconductors and batteries are the new industry control points. In fact, more than a third of the value of a BEV is associated with the battery. Consequently, the European supplier landscape is changing rapidly, and new capabilities are needed in development and manufacturing.\nRecently, software development and hardware development are increasingly decoupling. We\u2019ve observed that European suppliers have become proficient at the interaction between software and hardware in the context of specific control units that oversee specific components of a car, such as the engine or transmission. Modern vehicles may have as many as 150 control units in a distributed software architecture. Hardware and software will increasingly decouple as software becomes more centralized into domains such as the powertrain and in-vehicle connectivity\u2014and, eventually, into computers that oversee zones of the vehicle rather than components.\nAs a result of this shift toward more centralized computing, portions of vehicles may become commoditized, and scale and incremental improvements may become the main drivers of competitiveness. As a result, several component markets increasingly resemble the smartphone industry, in which the core differentiator is software innovation\u2014in addition to economies of scale, industrial excellence, and quality in hardware. McKinsey analysis suggests that the number of build-to-print suppliers (which manufacture products and components to customers\u2019 detailed engineering instructions) in the automotive industry that provide components such as power electronics will increase. We\u2019ve found that about a third of OEMs\u2019 requests for quotes in some powertrain components and systems are already build-to-print requests.\nNew entrants are moving to supply the automotive market with critical future technologies such as batteries, semiconductors, and software. Traditional suppliers find themselves sandwiched between \u201chigh-tech commodity\u201d companies that provide semiconductors and batteries upstream and cost-pressured incumbent OEMs downstream. This dynamic threatens European supply chains. Consider that the current battery value chain is largely controlled by Chinese companies (Exhibit 3).\nTo counteract these developments and form a strong supply network like the one Europe created during the ICE era, major industry participants are announcing strategic partnerships to secure access to resources and manufacturing capacity, especially for batteries and semiconductors. For example, some incumbents plan to strengthen their control over critical portions of the value chain by partnering with mine operators or even acquiring stakes in mines.14\u201cFactbox: Automakers accelerate drive to secure battery raw materials,\u201d Reuters, April 3, 2023; Victoria Waldersee, \u201cVolkswagen to invest in mines in bid to become global battery supplier,\u201d Reuters, March 17, 2023. While these actions are steps in the right direction, the projected supply and capacity are not yet enough to meet the region\u2019s forecast demand by 2030. Accelerated efforts are necessary.\nMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\nIn a perfect storm for the European auto industry, the current macroeconomic climate is turbulent, with multiple ongoing crises. Compared with other regions, Europe is particularly exposed and affected, and the automotive sector is at a disadvantage compared with other important industries. These challenges fall into five major areas:\nEnergy and resources. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe have surged to twice the costs in the United States and triple costs in China.1McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cChina electricity prices,\u201d GlobalPetrolPrices.com, December 2022; \u201cMidwest Information Office: Average energy prices for the United States, regions, census divisions, and selected metropolitan areas,\u201d US Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 17, 2023; and \u201cElectricity price statistics,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. This creates challenges for the auto industry, in which a significant portion of production costs come from energy requirements.\nGeopolitical tensions. The European auto industry generates a significant\u2014and higher compared with other regions\u2014share of its revenues through exports,2McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cInternational trade in cars,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. which means current geopolitical pressures have an outsize impact on European automakers.\nSupply chain challenges. Compared with other industries, the auto industry relies more heavily on timely deliveries of parts and components from international markets. The European auto industry is therefore at considerable risk when finely tuned international supply chains are disrupted.\nInflation. Inflation has hit Europe much more severely than the United States or China, with labor costs for European automakers disproportionately affected compared with other industries.3\u201cConsumer prices up 4.9 percent from April 2022 to April 2023,\u201d\u00a0TED: The Economics Daily, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 15, 2023.\nProductivity crisis. Europe\u2019s productivity and economic growth lag behind those of its peers, particularly in areas such as software engineering in which the auto industry needs significant additional capacity.4\u201cUnited States full year GDP growth,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cPriority reforms key for sustaining growth and achieving China\u2019s long-term goals - World Bank report,\u201d World Bank, June 14, 2023.\nFinally, these transformative forces overlap with a European macroeconomic environment that has a particularly acute impact on the region\u2019s auto industry (see sidebar \u201cMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\u201d).\nRoad map for the European automotive industry\nThe European auto industry is in the midst of the greatest change in its history. In service of helping the industry remain globally competitive we outline a road map of seven pillars for stakeholders to act on (Exhibit 4). The time to act is now: according to our analysis, European automotive OEMs and suppliers earn about three times the revenue of their Chinese counterparts and five times the EBIT, which means the European industry can act from a position of strength.\nA rapid response from OEMs and suppliers in the European auto industry will be important. But other stakeholders\u2014including adjacent industries such as the energy, research, and public sectors\u2014would also need to act collaboratively to provide an environment that enables success for the European automotive industry (and mobility ecosystem) of the future. In short, the ecosystem approach that made Europe strong in the ICE era has to be translated to serve the era of software-defined, electrified cars.\nRevive strengths in customer understanding, product design, and brand\nThe European automotive industry will need to extend its legacy of cutting-edge product design and superior brand value and transfer it into the new context of software-defined electric vehicles.\nOf the 25 global brands with the highest brand value, all but three are European.15\u201cLuxury & premium 2023 ranking,\u201d Brandirectory, Brand Finance, accessed August 15, 2023. Our data show that brand remains among the top five purchase criteria for European, American, and Chinese auto consumers. However, in the age of electrification and software-defined cars, purchase criteria will change and brand rankings might get reshuffled.\nTo maintain superior brand value, European incumbent OEMs would need to analyze and understand customer needs and preferences to build desirable products. Traditional consumer segmentation would need to be adapted for the era of software-defined electric vehicles, with more-detailed consumer profiles and more-granular user profiles. Owning and analyzing consumer data will enable OEMs to offer tailored mobility solutions and seamlessly engage consumers across the life cycle. They can also build their product development organizations to reflect customer journeys and experiences, which would bring operational roles closer to the customer. As consumers\u2019 desires change and technology advances, OEMs would need to continuously update their software remotely to bring the most up-to-date functionality to customers and meet their needs.\nFocus relentlessly on cost and speed\nMcKinsey research from 2022 shows that the vehicle purchase price is the most important buying factor for consumers across markets.16Annual MCFM Consumer Survey 2022, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, global n = 27,869, December 2022. Particularly in EVs, Chinese OEMs can turn their cost advantage into a competitive edge: our analysis shows that their costs are 20 to 30 percent lower than those of European OEMs.\nTo catch up, European OEMs could drive down costs strategically. According to our analysis, European OEMs could close up to 20 percentage points of the cost gap by adopting structural product design, vertically integrating battery production, scaling EV production, and improving productivity. For example, battery insourcing could decrease European OEMs\u2019 costs by three percentage points, and cost-efficient battery cell chemistry alternatives could save five to six percentage points for some vehicles and segments. As for the remaining 5 to 10 percentage-point cost gap, European OEMs could identify differentiating features that consumers would be willing to pay a premium for, such as brand differentiation; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership; and superior safety performance.\nSpeed is another consideration. McKinsey analysis shows that European OEMs have a long development cycle compared with competitors from other regions, with concept-to-pilot phases lasting up to four years. By contrast, we\u2019ve found that the fastest automakers in China need only 21 months to move from concept to pilot, allowing them to respond to market trends much more quickly.\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not necessarily appropriate to make direct comparisons between the Chinese and European automotive sectors or development cycles. However, European OEMs should take on the challenge and redesign their own processes to accelerate innovation, development, and industrialization. For instance, the product design process could be accelerated through iterative styling methods. Subsequent product development could be optimized by decoupling hardware and software development and by applying agile principles to software development. Across all processes, co-locating cross-domain teams and setting up task forces for products that are behind schedule or components with supply bottlenecks can further accelerate development.\nExecute a winning strategy for the Chinese market\nOur research shows China will remain the biggest automotive market in the future, which means winning in China will be important for European OEMs and suppliers that want to play a globally relevant role.\nEuropean incumbents have lost five percentage points of market share in China since 2019, a substantial decrease. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that Chinese automakers are outpacing their competitors and have gained more than ten percentage points of market share in China, driven by their hold on more than 80 percent of the EV market.17McKinsey analysis based on global passenger-car sales data from IHS Markit, 2002\u201322, accessed May 20, 2023.\nHow have they done it? Chinese OEMs offer significantly lower price points, and their products are more appealing and tailored to Chinese consumers\u2019 needs and preferences. They also bring targeted innovations to market rapidly; our research shows that more than 70 percent of new vehicles unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April 2023 came from Chinese OEMs.\nLike their OEM counterparts, European automotive suppliers have a hard time gaining traction with Chinese EV players, especially for EV powertrain components and systems. While Western suppliers have held more than half of China\u2019s ICE powertrain market, they hold less than 5 percent of the EV powertrain market.18McKinsey analysis based on IHS Markit Production Forecast, number of model launches by powertrain for Aion, BMW, BYD, Mercedes-Benz, NIO, Tesla, Volkswagen and Xpeng, data as of 2022, accessed June 10, 2023.\nEuropean OEMs and suppliers would need a fundamental strategic overhaul to regain competitiveness in China and meet the preferences of Chinese customers. This starts with developing products specifically tailored for the Chinese market. According to our research, the average customer in China is 34 years old, compared with 58 in Europe. These consumers have significantly different purchasing criteria. For instance, Chinese consumers place higher value on cutting-edge technology, connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, and on-board multimedia screens than European and American consumers do. Chinese car buyers also favor simplified vehicle choices with preconfigured options.19Thomas Fang, Mingyu Guan, Bill Peng, and Tony Zhou, \u201cMcKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2023,\u201d July 14, 2023.\nTo implement a \u201clocal for local\u201d strategy\u2014in which R&D, production, and distribution are in close proximity to where products will be bought and used\u2014European players would need to adjust their operating models for the Chinese market. For example, OEMs could localize research and development capabilities and transfer decision rights to local management. Entering local partnerships across the portfolio and supply chain will also be essential to develop a strong foothold in China and to benefit from the know-how and reputations of local partners.\nCreate resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains\nTo reduce bottlenecks and dependencies, the industry will need resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains centered on batteries, semiconductors, and green materials. In 2021, the chip crisis led to a loss of ten million vehicles in global production,20\u201cS&P Global Mobility on short- & long-term impact from chip shortage,\u201d Auto Remarketing, July 14, 2023. highlighting a need to increase supply chain resilience.\nTo create resilient supply, localization is vital. We project that the European supply\u2013demand gap for batteries will reach almost 40 percent, or 500 gigawatt-hours (GWh), by 2030. To cover European battery demand locally, an additional 20 gigafactories, a \u20ac35 billion investment, would be needed.21McKinsey Battery Insights analysis assumes a 500-GWh supply\u2013demand gap and average capital expenditures of \u20ac70 million per gigawatt hour in Europe. This leads to a \u20ac35 million investment need, in addition to the already announced \u20ac70 million for planned and existing factories in Europe. The continent would also need 37 new semiconductor fabs to cover local demand, requiring a \u20ac190 billion investment.22Annual report 2020: The automotive industry in facts and figures, Verband der Automobilindustrie, 2020. As a first step, the European Chips Act will provide \u20ac43 billion in subsidies. Next steps could involve expanding the ecosystem along the value chain while safeguarding crucial supplies, with tactics such as increasing safety stock and implementing dual-sourcing strategies.\nAt least in the midterm, improving the circularity of supply chains will further decrease Europe\u2019s dependence on raw materials and components from other regions while increasing sustainability. It could also increase the share of local added value in critical EV components and create additional jobs and economic growth. Our analysis shows that reusing materials from scrapped batteries can also save up to 10 percent of costs and avoid 20 percent of the CO2 required in production. To implement a circular value chain, industry stakeholders would need to commit to the use of recycled content and material efficiency and establish reverse operations at end of life.\nEnd-to-end transparency on ESG criteria such as digital traceability is an important way to make critical supply chains more sustainable. As sustainability standards in key industries begin to develop\u2014consider the launch of the battery passport, which contains ESG data for batteries23\u201cAction partnerships: Battery passport,\u201d Global Battery Alliance, accessed August 15, 2023.\u2014the European auto industry should stay at the forefront of ESG performance to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the future.\nHyperscale competitive European battery and semiconductor players\nWe\u2019ve observed that European players are underrepresented in battery manufacturing and high-end compute and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence. According to our analysis, only one European manufacturer is among the top ten in terms of market capitalization for battery manufacturing, while in semiconductors, Europe needs to close the capability gap for the next wave of computing to deliver functionalities such as ADAS.\nA path to creating an ecosystem of technology champions consists of three elements. First, Europe should consider developing a pan-European regulatory rule book to scale high-growth firms, aligning tax standards, regulations, labor rules, and bureaucratic processes. Second, to stay at the forefront of technology, the region would need to build specialized knowledge and product innovation capabilities. Suppliers could tap into niche specialties, such as more-sustainable battery refining. Finally, the European industry would need a battery and semiconductor network, similar to the one that serves the aerospace industry. European incumbents could form strategic partnerships with emerging entrants and research institutions.\nDesign a way forward for ADAS with policy support\nAdvanced driver assistance systems features are increasingly important. They are becoming a key differentiator for vehicle buyers: According to our research, 51 percent of consumers worldwide would consider switching to some form of ADAS car in the future. Competitive pressures around ADAS are also intensifying. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz was the first automotive player to introduce and certify Level 3 autonomy, the threshold at which drivers can take their hands off the wheel.24Andrew J. Hawkins, \u201cMercedes-Benz is the first to bring Level 3 automated driving to the US,\u201d Verge, January 27, 2023. Other participants in the global industry are catching up using a variety of technology approaches.\nTo remain competitive, the European industry may need to form a cross-industry alliance. Players could collaborate in two main areas. The first area is where differentiation is negligible and where there are opportunities for savings. This would include standardizing sensor communication protocols, which would simplify the integration of new sensors. Standardizing middleware (which sits between front- and back-end technologies) and layers of the operating system are other approaches.\nThe second area of collaboration is where scale and large databases could enable a faster, more robust development process for efforts including the continuous updates of software layers in maps\u2014updates such as creating high-definition map- and location-based services. A shared pool of data could also be used for AI training and validation.\nThe right regulatory environment could be critical to enable this kind of cross-industry collaboration. Public-sector stakeholders could consider adapting existing guidelines to the context of autonomous driving. These updates could encourage collaborative precompetitive research and innovation that advance and accelerate technological progress and drive standardization.\nClose the software skill gap to win the automotive digital transition\nSoftware is essential to the future of the automotive industry. But according to our analysis, only 15 to 20 percent of current R&D workers at European incumbents have software skills, compared with almost 45 percent at new entrants.\nTo shrink the gap, industry stakeholders would need to find holistic solutions. For example, European incumbents could create shared\u2014or at least interoperable\u2014software platforms across OEMs in Europe (and possibly other regions where the industry has strong partnerships) to complement individual participants\u2019 capabilities and to avoid costly solo efforts.\nEarly hiring, reskilling, and foreign talent can also help close the gap. Players can intensify early hiring directly from universities and boost STEM and software talent education through partnerships with universities and schools. Our research shows that reskilling is already in progress: 37 percent of European suppliers have ongoing reskilling efforts, and another 41 percent have plans to implement them. To draw skilled software talent from other regions, European employers would need accelerate processes around work permits and accommodate foreign talent\u2019s requirements on salary, benefits, and working conditions.\nCreating an environment that enables accelerated progress\nAbout the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility\nThese insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobility\u2014from consumer needs to modal mix across urban/rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. Contact us if you are interested in getting full access to our market insights via the McKinsey Mobility Insights Portal.\nEuropean automotive players are moving in the right direction but should consider scaling and accelerating their efforts. To accomplish this, a wide variety of stakeholders in the region would need to create an environment that breeds progress and future wins for the region\u2019s automotive industry. The formula requires a road map, catalysts, and platforms for cooperation.\nA clear road map such as the one we outline is needed to help accelerate the European automotive industry\u2019s progress. Its seven pillars would need to be converted into actionable measures and quantifiable targets for industry stakeholders\u2014suppliers, OEMs, players from adjacent industries, and regulatory bodies. Associations could take on a coordinating role.\nCatalysts play a significant role in implementing the road map. One is a competitive regulatory environment. Clearly defining and communicating common standards and codifying interoperability across all elements of the road map is likely to be critical.\nAnother critical catalyst of the European industry\u2019s transition is EV infrastructure. According to our analysis, the industry will need a cumulative \u20ac300 billion worth of infrastructure investments in electricity generation, the electricity grid, EV chargers, and hydrogen refueling systems through 2030.25European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. European stakeholders have begun to install public chargers at a pace of 2,000 charging points per week.26European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. But to meet demand, decision makers would need to build out charging infrastructure to the tune of 6,000 to 14,000 charging points per week.27European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. We found that the wind and solar assets required to fulfill the corresponding demand for energy with renewable sources would require four times as many workers in Europe by 2030 than are currently available.\nFinally, the industry would need platforms for collaboration. As industry boundaries are redefined, three kinds of partnership will become more important: horizontal partnerships between entities in the same parts of the value chain (such as multiple car companies) for efforts such as software development or to gain a solid footing in the Chinese market; vertical partnerships between entities in different parts of the value chain (such as car companies with tech companies) to secure access to technology and talent; and cross-industry partnerships, such as collaborations between automotive players and utilities to facilitate structural goals such as seamless sector coupling.\nOur road map shows a way forward for a globally competitive European auto industry. The work will require action from an expansive array of regional stakeholders and a supportive administrative environment. Time is of the essence.\nAndreas Cornet and Andreas Tschiesner are senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Munich office, where Patrick Schaufuss is a partner; Ruth Heuss is a senior partner in the Berlin office.\nThe authors wish to thank Ondrej Burkacky, Julian Conzade, Johannes Deichmann, Lauritz Fischer, Maximilian Geirhos, Marco Groth, Volker Gr\u00fcntges, Antonia Gutzler, Martin Hattrup-Silberberg, Martin Kellner, Martin Linder, Nicoline L\u00fchrs, Lukas Michor, Jan Paulitschek, and Kirsten Weerda for their contributions to this report.",
    "Summarized_Document": "The European automotive industry is a significant contributor to the region's economy, accounting for nearly 7% of GDP and employing around 14 million people. However, it faces challenges such as the shift to electrified powertrains, software differentiation, and competition from new entrants, particularly from China. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports, with 3.0 million vehicles compared to Germany's 2.6 million. Rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions further complicate the industry's landscape.The industry has historically been a hub of innovation, with 30% of global automotive patents originating from Europe. Investments in R&D have led to advancements in sustainability and safety. The brand value of the top ten European auto companies is estimated at \u20ac200 billion, with five of the ten most valuable car brands being European.Despite these strengths, the industry is undergoing significant disruptions. European OEMs have lost market share to Chinese competitors, particularly in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The transition to EVs is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80% annually since 2020. European OEMs have announced plans to launch over 150 EV models by 2030.The shift to software-defined vehicles is also crucial, with semiconductors and batteries becoming key components. European suppliers need to adapt to this change, as modern vehicles may have up to 150 control units. The industry must also address supply chain challenges, particularly in batteries and semiconductors, to remain competitive.Macroeconomic challenges such as high energy costs, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a productivity crisis further impact the industry. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe are twice those in the U.S. and triple those in China, affecting production costs.To navigate these challenges, a road map with seven pillars is proposed: understanding customer needs, focusing on cost and speed, executing a winning strategy for the Chinese market, creating resilient supply chains, developing competitive battery and semiconductor players, advancing ADAS with policy support, and closing the software skill gap.European OEMs need to localize R&D and production in China, develop products tailored to Chinese consumers, and form strategic partnerships. Resilient supply chains require localization, circularity, and sustainability. The industry needs significant investments in battery and semiconductor manufacturing to meet future demand.Collaboration across the industry and with adjacent sectors is essential. A competitive regulatory environment and substantial investments in EV infrastructure are critical. The industry must also focus on software skills, with only 15-20% of current R&D workers having software expertise compared to 45% at new entrants.In summary, the European automotive industry must act swiftly and collaboratively to maintain its global competitiveness in the face of profound changes and challenges.",

For decades, the industry has been an important contributor to Europe\u2019s economic growth, innovation, and prosperity, accounting for almost 7 percent of the region\u2019s GDP and being directly or indirectly responsible for employing almost 14 million people.1\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, European Commission, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d ACEA, September 1, 2022; 25 actions for a successful restart of the EU\u2019s automotive sector, CLEPA, May 2020. The industry also carries significant symbolic weight; taglines such as \u201cMade in Germany,\u201d \u201cItalian car design,\u201d \u201cEuro NCAP for Saver Cars,\u201d and \u201cBritish racing\u201d have come to stand for European innovation and craftsmanship.\nHowever, the status quo is being challenged and the industry faces massive ongoing transformations, such as the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains and a shift in focus from hardware to differentiation through software. This dynamic has allowed new entrants in Europe and abroad\u2014especially in China, the largest automotive market in the world2\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d China - Country Commercial Guide, International Trade Administration, updated April 7, 2023.\u2014to disrupt the market and win market share. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports for the first time, with exports of about 3.0 million vehicles, in contrast to Germany\u2019s 2.6 million.3\u201cWhat if Germany stopped making cars?,\u201d Economist, July 31, 2023. These transformative forces overlap with a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, including rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. All of these factors have greatly affected the European auto industry and make navigating the sector\u2019s transformation challenging. A prosperous future for the European automotive industry will therefore depend on how well and quickly it responds and how European stakeholders can shape the necessary conditions for future success. The need for action is urgent.\nTo that end, we have sketched a road map that covers seven areas. Executing on this plan will require action from a variety of industry stakeholders. Speedy action from automotive companies will be important, but the regional ecosystem, including the public sector and multiple adjacent sectors, will need to participate in shaping a level playing field and a fertile environment for the future of the European automotive industry.\nA multidecade success story\nThe European automotive industry has been an engine powering prosperity and growth, employment, and innovation and has contributed to Europe\u2019s image and perception on the global stage (Exhibit 1).\nAn economic powerhouse for the region, the automotive industry contributed about 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exports in 2022.425 actions for a successful restart, May 2020; \u201cEuropean Union exports by category,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023. The sector\u2019s more than 17,300 companies form a network of OEMs and suppliers of all tiers.5\u201cImpact of electromobility on the European automotive industry,\u201d HitHorizons, February 21, 2022. Significantly, the industry directly or indirectly employs more than 6 percent of the region\u2019s workforce,6\u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d September 1, 2022. creating positive spillover effects outside the sector.\nThe automotive industry has also been a nexus of innovation. Technical champions and small and medium-size businesses within the ecosystem have continuously innovated, especially in the areas of combustion engine powertrain, chassis, safety systems, and exterior and interior design. Indeed, about 30 percent of global automotive patents originated from European countries, the most of any region.7McKinsey analysis based on data about automotive industry global patents from IPlytics and Innography by Clarivate, accessed June 12, 2023. Significant investments into research and development have helped European automakers introduce new technologies that have contributed to major advances in sustainability and safety by improving fuel economies and reducing emissions, noise, and accidents.\nProgress and investment in the European auto industry over the past several decades have contributed to Europe\u2019s global image. German engineering is widely touted,8Dave Taylor, \u201cWho owns the idea of German engineering among German car brands?,\u201d Taylor Brand Group, April 8, 2013. and our research suggests many European automakers are considered front-runners in sustainability, with some of the most ambitious targets around electric vehicles (EVs), decarbonization, and safety.\nThanks in part to this work, the brand value of the ten largest European auto companies is conservatively estimated at a combined \u20ac200 billion; five of the ten most valuable car brands worldwide are European.9\u201cLargest automakers by market capitalization,\u201d CompaniesMarketcap.com, accessed August 15, 2023; brand value analysis based on 2023 data on European automotive companies from Brand Finance, accessed June 20, 2023; Alex Haigh, \u201c2022 Automotive industry trends: Doubling down on electric and connected cars,\u201d Brand Finance, February 22, 2022. The grand challenge now is to maintain and build on these assets in the face of profound and accelerating change.\nDisruption and transformation\nThe historic strengths and recently reported record margins of European OEMs may create a false sense of safety for the industry. Accelerated disruptions around electrification, software, and new competitive pressures loom.\nSubstantial market disruptions have been observed in other industries, with serious outcomes. For instance, European manufacturers lost more than 90 percent of their share of the smartphone market in just six years.10\u201cGlobal market share held by Nokia smartphones from 1st quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2013,\u201d Statista Research Department, July 25, 2013. McKinsey analysis shows that leading players in the film camera industry lost similar market share over nine years.\nMarket share data suggest that European OEMs\u2019 leadership position is being challenged as new entrants, especially from China, gain traction. Our analysis also suggests that European market conditions for local development and production are becoming less competitive. Analysis from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility shows that since 2019, European incumbents have lost six percentage points of market share in their home market and five percentage points in China. Meanwhile, Chinese OEMs are gaining ground in both China and Europe, reaching 45 percent market share in their home market in 2022 and octupling their market share in Europe between 2020 and 2022.11McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. This dynamic is even more apparent in battery electric vehicles (BEVs): new EV-focused entrants hold 51 percent of the global BEV market (Exhibit 2).12McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. Besides market share, European OEMs also face the challenge of running profitable BEV businesses.\nA more detailed look at different segments offers a more nuanced picture of the industry. In the premium segment\u2014home turf for many European OEMs\u2014European OEMs still hold 71 percent of global sales. But this segment is also becoming more challenging to hold: newcomers claimed 18 percent of the premium market in 2022.13McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023.\nThis shake-up stems from the fast pace of change in the industry. The transition from internal-combustion-engine (ICE) to zero-emissions vehicles is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80 percent per year since 2020. McKinsey analysis suggests that many global mobility markets will reach near-total EV penetration by the mid-2030s. In response, European OEMs have announced ambitious electrification plans to launch more than 150 EV models through 2030, according to McKinsey analysis.\nThe EV transition drives the industry\u2019s emphasis away from hardware toward software and digital. According to our analysis, EV consumers are more than twice as likely to switch brands for better in-vehicle technology, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features and connectivity services. Our research shows that successful automakers are developing cars defined by software, resulting in a tripling of software content per vehicle since 2015.\nWith electrified, software-defined cars becoming the norm, semiconductors and batteries are the new industry control points. In fact, more than a third of the value of a BEV is associated with the battery. Consequently, the European supplier landscape is changing rapidly, and new capabilities are needed in development and manufacturing.\nRecently, software development and hardware development are increasingly decoupling. We\u2019ve observed that European suppliers have become proficient at the interaction between software and hardware in the context of specific control units that oversee specific components of a car, such as the engine or transmission. Modern vehicles may have as many as 150 control units in a distributed software architecture. Hardware and software will increasingly decouple as software becomes more centralized into domains such as the powertrain and in-vehicle connectivity\u2014and, eventually, into computers that oversee zones of the vehicle rather than components.\nAs a result of this shift toward more centralized computing, portions of vehicles may become commoditized, and scale and incremental improvements may become the main drivers of competitiveness. As a result, several component markets increasingly resemble the smartphone industry, in which the core differentiator is software innovation\u2014in addition to economies of scale, industrial excellence, and quality in hardware. McKinsey analysis suggests that the number of build-to-print suppliers (which manufacture products and components to customers\u2019 detailed engineering instructions) in the automotive industry that provide components such as power electronics will increase. We\u2019ve found that about a third of OEMs\u2019 requests for quotes in some powertrain components and systems are already build-to-print requests.\nNew entrants are moving to supply the automotive market with critical future technologies such as batteries, semiconductors, and software. Traditional suppliers find themselves sandwiched between \u201chigh-tech commodity\u201d companies that provide semiconductors and batteries upstream and cost-pressured incumbent OEMs downstream. This dynamic threatens European supply chains. Consider that the current battery value chain is largely controlled by Chinese companies (Exhibit 3).\nTo counteract these developments and form a strong supply network like the one Europe created during the ICE era, major industry participants are announcing strategic partnerships to secure access to resources and manufacturing capacity, especially for batteries and semiconductors. For example, some incumbents plan to strengthen their control over critical portions of the value chain by partnering with mine operators or even acquiring stakes in mines.14\u201cFactbox: Automakers accelerate drive to secure battery raw materials,\u201d Reuters, April 3, 2023; Victoria Waldersee, \u201cVolkswagen to invest in mines in bid to become global battery supplier,\u201d Reuters, March 17, 2023. While these actions are steps in the right direction, the projected supply and capacity are not yet enough to meet the region\u2019s forecast demand by 2030. Accelerated efforts are necessary.\nMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\nIn a perfect storm for the European auto industry, the current macroeconomic climate is turbulent, with multiple ongoing crises. Compared with other regions, Europe is particularly exposed and affected, and the automotive sector is at a disadvantage compared with other important industries. These challenges fall into five major areas:\nEnergy and resources. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe have surged to twice the costs in the United States and triple costs in China.1McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cChina electricity prices,\u201d GlobalPetrolPrices.com, December 2022; \u201cMidwest Information Office: Average energy prices for the United States, regions, census divisions, and selected metropolitan areas,\u201d US Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 17, 2023; and \u201cElectricity price statistics,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. This creates challenges for the auto industry, in which a significant portion of production costs come from energy requirements.\nGeopolitical tensions. The European auto industry generates a significant\u2014and higher compared with other regions\u2014share of its revenues through exports,2McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cInternational trade in cars,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. which means current geopolitical pressures have an outsize impact on European automakers.\nSupply chain challenges. Compared with other industries, the auto industry relies more heavily on timely deliveries of parts and components from international markets. The European auto industry is therefore at considerable risk when finely tuned international supply chains are disrupted.\nInflation. Inflation has hit Europe much more severely than the United States or China, with labor costs for European automakers disproportionately affected compared with other industries.3\u201cConsumer prices up 4.9 percent from April 2022 to April 2023,\u201d\u00a0TED: The Economics Daily, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 15, 2023.\nProductivity crisis. Europe\u2019s productivity and economic growth lag behind those of its peers, particularly in areas such as software engineering in which the auto industry needs significant additional capacity.4\u201cUnited States full year GDP growth,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cPriority reforms key for sustaining growth and achieving China\u2019s long-term goals - World Bank report,\u201d World Bank, June 14, 2023.\nFinally, these transformative forces overlap with a European macroeconomic environment that has a particularly acute impact on the region\u2019s auto industry (see sidebar \u201cMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\u201d).\nRoad map for the European automotive industry\nThe European auto industry is in the midst of the greatest change in its history. In service of helping the industry remain globally competitive we outline a road map of seven pillars for stakeholders to act on (Exhibit 4). The time to act is now: according to our analysis, European automotive OEMs and suppliers earn about three times the revenue of their Chinese counterparts and five times the EBIT, which means the European industry can act from a position of strength.\nA rapid response from OEMs and suppliers in the European auto industry will be important. But other stakeholders\u2014including adjacent industries such as the energy, research, and public sectors\u2014would also need to act collaboratively to provide an environment that enables success for the European automotive industry (and mobility ecosystem) of the future. In short, the ecosystem approach that made Europe strong in the ICE era has to be translated to serve the era of software-defined, electrified cars.\nRevive strengths in customer understanding, product design, and brand\nThe European automotive industry will need to extend its legacy of cutting-edge product design and superior brand value and transfer it into the new context of software-defined electric vehicles.\nOf the 25 global brands with the highest brand value, all but three are European.15\u201cLuxury & premium 2023 ranking,\u201d Brandirectory, Brand Finance, accessed August 15, 2023. Our data show that brand remains among the top five purchase criteria for European, American, and Chinese auto consumers. However, in the age of electrification and software-defined cars, purchase criteria will change and brand rankings might get reshuffled.\nTo maintain superior brand value, European incumbent OEMs would need to analyze and understand customer needs and preferences to build desirable products. Traditional consumer segmentation would need to be adapted for the era of software-defined electric vehicles, with more-detailed consumer profiles and more-granular user profiles. Owning and analyzing consumer data will enable OEMs to offer tailored mobility solutions and seamlessly engage consumers across the life cycle. They can also build their product development organizations to reflect customer journeys and experiences, which would bring operational roles closer to the customer. As consumers\u2019 desires change and technology advances, OEMs would need to continuously update their software remotely to bring the most up-to-date functionality to customers and meet their needs.\nFocus relentlessly on cost and speed\nMcKinsey research from 2022 shows that the vehicle purchase price is the most important buying factor for consumers across markets.16Annual MCFM Consumer Survey 2022, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, global n = 27,869, December 2022. Particularly in EVs, Chinese OEMs can turn their cost advantage into a competitive edge: our analysis shows that their costs are 20 to 30 percent lower than those of European OEMs.\nTo catch up, European OEMs could drive down costs strategically. According to our analysis, European OEMs could close up to 20 percentage points of the cost gap by adopting structural product design, vertically integrating battery production, scaling EV production, and improving productivity. For example, battery insourcing could decrease European OEMs\u2019 costs by three percentage points, and cost-efficient battery cell chemistry alternatives could save five to six percentage points for some vehicles and segments. As for the remaining 5 to 10 percentage-point cost gap, European OEMs could identify differentiating features that consumers would be willing to pay a premium for, such as brand differentiation; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership; and superior safety performance.\nSpeed is another consideration. McKinsey analysis shows that European OEMs have a long development cycle compared with competitors from other regions, with concept-to-pilot phases lasting up to four years. By contrast, we\u2019ve found that the fastest automakers in China need only 21 months to move from concept to pilot, allowing them to respond to market trends much more quickly.\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not necessarily appropriate to make direct comparisons between the Chinese and European automotive sectors or development cycles. However, European OEMs should take on the challenge and redesign their own processes to accelerate innovation, development, and industrialization. For instance, the product design process could be accelerated through iterative styling methods. Subsequent product development could be optimized by decoupling hardware and software development and by applying agile principles to software development. Across all processes, co-locating cross-domain teams and setting up task forces for products that are behind schedule or components with supply bottlenecks can further accelerate development.\nExecute a winning strategy for the Chinese market\nOur research shows China will remain the biggest automotive market in the future, which means winning in China will be important for European OEMs and suppliers that want to play a globally relevant role.\nEuropean incumbents have lost five percentage points of market share in China since 2019, a substantial decrease. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that Chinese automakers are outpacing their competitors and have gained more than ten percentage points of market share in China, driven by their hold on more than 80 percent of the EV market.17McKinsey analysis based on global passenger-car sales data from IHS Markit, 2002\u201322, accessed May 20, 2023.\nHow have they done it? Chinese OEMs offer significantly lower price points, and their products are more appealing and tailored to Chinese consumers\u2019 needs and preferences. They also bring targeted innovations to market rapidly; our research shows that more than 70 percent of new vehicles unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April 2023 came from Chinese OEMs.\nLike their OEM counterparts, European automotive suppliers have a hard time gaining traction with Chinese EV players, especially for EV powertrain components and systems. While Western suppliers have held more than half of China\u2019s ICE powertrain market, they hold less than 5 percent of the EV powertrain market.18McKinsey analysis based on IHS Markit Production Forecast, number of model launches by powertrain for Aion, BMW, BYD, Mercedes-Benz, NIO, Tesla, Volkswagen and Xpeng, data as of 2022, accessed June 10, 2023.\nEuropean OEMs and suppliers would need a fundamental strategic overhaul to regain competitiveness in China and meet the preferences of Chinese customers. This starts with developing products specifically tailored for the Chinese market. According to our research, the average customer in China is 34 years old, compared with 58 in Europe. These consumers have significantly different purchasing criteria. For instance, Chinese consumers place higher value on cutting-edge technology, connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, and on-board multimedia screens than European and American consumers do. Chinese car buyers also favor simplified vehicle choices with preconfigured options.19Thomas Fang, Mingyu Guan, Bill Peng, and Tony Zhou, \u201cMcKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2023,\u201d July 14, 2023.\nTo implement a \u201clocal for local\u201d strategy\u2014in which R&D, production, and distribution are in close proximity to where products will be bought and used\u2014European players would need to adjust their operating models for the Chinese market. For example, OEMs could localize research and development capabilities and transfer decision rights to local management. Entering local partnerships across the portfolio and supply chain will also be essential to develop a strong foothold in China and to benefit from the know-how and reputations of local partners.\nCreate resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains\nTo reduce bottlenecks and dependencies, the industry will need resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains centered on batteries, semiconductors, and green materials. In 2021, the chip crisis led to a loss of ten million vehicles in global production,20\u201cS&P Global Mobility on short- & long-term impact from chip shortage,\u201d Auto Remarketing, July 14, 2023. highlighting a need to increase supply chain resilience.\nTo create resilient supply, localization is vital. We project that the European supply\u2013demand gap for batteries will reach almost 40 percent, or 500 gigawatt-hours (GWh), by 2030. To cover European battery demand locally, an additional 20 gigafactories, a \u20ac35 billion investment, would be needed.21McKinsey Battery Insights analysis assumes a 500-GWh supply\u2013demand gap and average capital expenditures of \u20ac70 million per gigawatt hour in Europe. This leads to a \u20ac35 million investment need, in addition to the already announced \u20ac70 million for planned and existing factories in Europe. The continent would also need 37 new semiconductor fabs to cover local demand, requiring a \u20ac190 billion investment.22Annual report 2020: The automotive industry in facts and figures, Verband der Automobilindustrie, 2020. As a first step, the European Chips Act will provide \u20ac43 billion in subsidies. Next steps could involve expanding the ecosystem along the value chain while safeguarding crucial supplies, with tactics such as increasing safety stock and implementing dual-sourcing strategies.\nAt least in the midterm, improving the circularity of supply chains will further decrease Europe\u2019s dependence on raw materials and components from other regions while increasing sustainability. It could also increase the share of local added value in critical EV components and create additional jobs and economic growth. Our analysis shows that reusing materials from scrapped batteries can also save up to 10 percent of costs and avoid 20 percent of the CO2 required in production. To implement a circular value chain, industry stakeholders would need to commit to the use of recycled content and material efficiency and establish reverse operations at end of life.\nEnd-to-end transparency on ESG criteria such as digital traceability is an important way to make critical supply chains more sustainable. As sustainability standards in key industries begin to develop\u2014consider the launch of the battery passport, which contains ESG data for batteries23\u201cAction partnerships: Battery passport,\u201d Global Battery Alliance, accessed August 15, 2023.\u2014the European auto industry should stay at the forefront of ESG performance to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the future.\nHyperscale competitive European battery and semiconductor players\nWe\u2019ve observed that European players are underrepresented in battery manufacturing and high-end compute and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence. According to our analysis, only one European manufacturer is among the top ten in terms of market capitalization for battery manufacturing, while in semiconductors, Europe needs to close the capability gap for the next wave of computing to deliver functionalities such as ADAS.\nA path to creating an ecosystem of technology champions consists of three elements. First, Europe should consider developing a pan-European regulatory rule book to scale high-growth firms, aligning tax standards, regulations, labor rules, and bureaucratic processes. Second, to stay at the forefront of technology, the region would need to build specialized knowledge and product innovation capabilities. Suppliers could tap into niche specialties, such as more-sustainable battery refining. Finally, the European industry would need a battery and semiconductor network, similar to the one that serves the aerospace industry. European incumbents could form strategic partnerships with emerging entrants and research institutions.\nDesign a way forward for ADAS with policy support\nAdvanced driver assistance systems features are increasingly important. They are becoming a key differentiator for vehicle buyers: According to our research, 51 percent of consumers worldwide would consider switching to some form of ADAS car in the future. Competitive pressures around ADAS are also intensifying. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz was the first automotive player to introduce and certify Level 3 autonomy, the threshold at which drivers can take their hands off the wheel.24Andrew J. Hawkins, \u201cMercedes-Benz is the first to bring Level 3 automated driving to the US,\u201d Verge, January 27, 2023. Other participants in the global industry are catching up using a variety of technology approaches.\nTo remain competitive, the European industry may need to form a cross-industry alliance. Players could collaborate in two main areas. The first area is where differentiation is negligible and where there are opportunities for savings. This would include standardizing sensor communication protocols, which would simplify the integration of new sensors. Standardizing middleware (which sits between front- and back-end technologies) and layers of the operating system are other approaches.\nThe second area of collaboration is where scale and large databases could enable a faster, more robust development process for efforts including the continuous updates of software layers in maps\u2014updates such as creating high-definition map- and location-based services. A shared pool of data could also be used for AI training and validation.\nThe right regulatory environment could be critical to enable this kind of cross-industry collaboration. Public-sector stakeholders could consider adapting existing guidelines to the context of autonomous driving. These updates could encourage collaborative precompetitive research and innovation that advance and accelerate technological progress and drive standardization.\nClose the software skill gap to win the automotive digital transition\nSoftware is essential to the future of the automotive industry. But according to our analysis, only 15 to 20 percent of current R&D workers at European incumbents have software skills, compared with almost 45 percent at new entrants.\nTo shrink the gap, industry stakeholders would need to find holistic solutions. For example, European incumbents could create shared\u2014or at least interoperable\u2014software platforms across OEMs in Europe (and possibly other regions where the industry has strong partnerships) to complement individual participants\u2019 capabilities and to avoid costly solo efforts.\nEarly hiring, reskilling, and foreign talent can also help close the gap. Players can intensify early hiring directly from universities and boost STEM and software talent education through partnerships with universities and schools. Our research shows that reskilling is already in progress: 37 percent of European suppliers have ongoing reskilling efforts, and another 41 percent have plans to implement them. To draw skilled software talent from other regions, European employers would need accelerate processes around work permits and accommodate foreign talent\u2019s requirements on salary, benefits, and working conditions.\nCreating an environment that enables accelerated progress\nAbout the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility\nThese insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobility\u2014from consumer needs to modal mix across urban/rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. Contact us if you are interested in getting full access to our market insights via the McKinsey Mobility Insights Portal.\nEuropean automotive players are moving in the right direction but should consider scaling and accelerating their efforts. To accomplish this, a wide variety of stakeholders in the region would need to create an environment that breeds progress and future wins for the region\u2019s automotive industry. The formula requires a road map, catalysts, and platforms for cooperation.\nA clear road map such as the one we outline is needed to help accelerate the European automotive industry\u2019s progress. Its seven pillars would need to be converted into actionable measures and quantifiable targets for industry stakeholders\u2014suppliers, OEMs, players from adjacent industries, and regulatory bodies. Associations could take on a coordinating role.\nCatalysts play a significant role in implementing the road map. One is a competitive regulatory environment. Clearly defining and communicating common standards and codifying interoperability across all elements of the road map is likely to be critical.\nAnother critical catalyst of the European industry\u2019s transition is EV infrastructure. According to our analysis, the industry will need a cumulative \u20ac300 billion worth of infrastructure investments in electricity generation, the electricity grid, EV chargers, and hydrogen refueling systems through 2030.25European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. European stakeholders have begun to install public chargers at a pace of 2,000 charging points per week.26European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. But to meet demand, decision makers would need to build out charging infrastructure to the tune of 6,000 to 14,000 charging points per week.27European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. We found that the wind and solar assets required to fulfill the corresponding demand for energy with renewable sources would require four times as many workers in Europe by 2030 than are currently available.\nFinally, the industry would need platforms for collaboration. As industry boundaries are redefined, three kinds of partnership will become more important: horizontal partnerships between entities in the same parts of the value chain (such as multiple car companies) for efforts such as software development or to gain a solid footing in the Chinese market; vertical partnerships between entities in different parts of the value chain (such as car companies with tech companies) to secure access to technology and talent; and cross-industry partnerships, such as collaborations between automotive players and utilities to facilitate structural goals such as seamless sector coupling.\nOur road map shows a way forward for a globally competitive European auto industry. The work will require action from an expansive array of regional stakeholders and a supportive administrative environment. Time is of the essence.\nAndreas Cornet and Andreas Tschiesner are senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Munich office, where Patrick Schaufuss is a partner; Ruth Heuss is a senior partner in the Berlin office.\nThe authors wish to thank Ondrej Burkacky, Julian Conzade, Johannes Deichmann, Lauritz Fischer, Maximilian Geirhos, Marco Groth, Volker Gr\u00fcntges, Antonia Gutzler, Martin Hattrup-Silberberg, Martin Kellner, Martin Linder, Nicoline L\u00fchrs, Lukas Michor, Jan Paulitschek, and Kirsten Weerda for their contributions to this report.",
    "Summarized_Document": "The European automotive industry is a significant contributor to the region's economy, accounting for nearly 7% of GDP and employing around 14 million people. However, it faces challenges such as the shift to electrified powertrains, software differentiation, and competition from new entrants, particularly from China. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports, with 3.0 million vehicles compared to Germany's 2.6 million. Rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions further complicate the industry's landscape.The industry has historically been a hub of innovation, with 30% of global automotive patents originating from Europe. Investments in R&D have led to advancements in sustainability and safety. The brand value of the top ten European auto companies is estimated at \u20ac200 billion, with five of the ten most valuable car brands being European.Despite these strengths, the industry is undergoing significant disruptions. European OEMs have lost market share to Chinese competitors, particularly in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The transition to EVs is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80% annually since 2020. European OEMs have announced plans to launch over 150 EV models by 2030.The shift to software-defined vehicles is also crucial, with semiconductors and batteries becoming key components. European suppliers need to adapt to this change, as modern vehicles may have up to 150 control units. The industry must also address supply chain challenges, particularly in batteries and semiconductors, to remain competitive.Macroeconomic challenges such as high energy costs, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a productivity crisis further impact the industry. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe are twice those in the U.S. and triple those in China, affecting production costs.To navigate these challenges, a road map with seven pillars is proposed: understanding customer needs, focusing on cost and speed, executing a winning strategy for the Chinese market, creating resilient supply chains, developing competitive battery and semiconductor players, advancing ADAS with policy support, and closing the software skill gap.European OEMs need to localize R&D and production in China, develop products tailored to Chinese consumers, and form strategic partnerships. Resilient supply chains require localization, circularity, and sustainability. The industry needs significant investments in battery and semiconductor manufacturing to meet future demand.Collaboration across the industry and with adjacent sectors is essential. A competitive regulatory environment and substantial investments in EV infrastructure are critical. The industry must also focus on software skills, with only 15-20% of current R&D workers having software expertise compared to 45% at new entrants.In summary, the European automotive industry must act swiftly and collaboratively to maintain its global competitiveness in the face of profound changes and challenges.",

    "Document": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\nA rendering of the view future travelers will see when they approach the new terminal. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nFlying is essential for work, vacation or visiting loved ones. The industry also is necessary to ship goods overseas quickly. However, it\u2019s not known for being environmentally friendly. One airport is seeking to change that.\nAviation contributes 3.5 percent of effective radiative forcing (which measures energy imbalance), 2.5 percent of carbon emissions and 1.9 percent of all greenhouse gas output. So there\u2019s a strong push to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel, starting at the airport.\nPittsburgh\u2019s Terminal Modernization\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s Terminal Modernization Program is a $1.4 billion project to create a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated former hub facilities, better serves passengers, fuels the region\u2019s future development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh. The new multi-modal complex will feature a new garage that nearly triples the amount of covered parking.\nThe PIT Terminal Modernization Program (TMP) was built upon these five principles that represent fundamental purposes driving the transformation:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Stabilize\u00a0airline costs\n2.\u00a0 Be\u00a0Pittsburgh\u2019s airport\n3.\u00a0 Be environmentally\u00a0sustainable\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Enhance the experience\u00a0for all customers\n5.\u00a0 Provide\u00a0value\u00a0to our\u00a0community\n\u00a0\nCranes install steel beams as part of the terminal modernization program.(triblive.com)\n1. Airport Modernization\nThe new terminal will be between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. The new facility will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh (origin and destination traffic) as opposed to the existing facility which was largely built as a hub facility focused on connecting traffic.\n2. Improved Experience\nThe layout should make navigating the airport quicker and easier. It will slash passengers\u2019 time from curbside to airside in half. Aesthetic improvements will enhance everyone\u2019s experience, and new outdoor terraces (pre- and post-security) will make it easier for travelers to relax before boarding their flight.\n3. Increased Area Value\nAirports raise the value of the area around them by encouraging economic growth and adding convenience for potential new residents. The terminal modernization brings more than 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, and that number will increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023.\n4. Stabilized Airline Costs\nAirport efficiency can impact the costs of airlines. The expansion will allow airlines to better process and load luggage as well as welcome passengers. It also lowers long-term O&M costs.\n5. More Sustainable Terminal\nConstruction practices for the new terminal comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Environmental Program Declaration (EPD) credit for their materials while also working to reduce emissions, water, energy and waste. Officials are targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification for the facility.\nVendors are strongly encouraged to present products and services that comply with verified third-party certification criteria or reporting standards. The airport also urges them to source their products or materials regionally to decrease the impact on the environment and human health compared to similar vendors in other locations.\nAdvantus Engineers is collaborating with other teams and implementing sustainable practices such as water and energy efficiency, using sustainable materials, managing waste, employing electric transportation methods, and promoting healthy indoor environments.\nAdditionally, the airport is recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\nThe 2030 Challenge\nPart of constructing the new terminal is moving the airport closer to achieving the 2030 Challenge, an environmental initiative to go carbon-neutral by that year.\nThe suggested plan by Architecture 2030 is to decrease 90 percent of carbon emissions by 2025 and be 100 percent carbon neutral by 2030. New buildings, renovations and additions throughout the new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards.\nA Timeline for Construction 2021\nApril:\u00a0Officials added safe driving lanes and barricades between concourses C and D. Saw-cutting began on the ramp to remove slabs.\nMay:\u00a0To prepare for the new terminal\u2019s foundation, 300,000 square feet of material were removed.\nJune:\u00a0An impact roller broke up large concrete sections to crush into smaller aggregate for reuse in new roadways.\nJuly:\u00a0Construction teams modified an underground fuel line for future use.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Team members began installation of electrical lines, construction trailers and underground utility work. Geotechnical borings for probe holes and test piles began for terminal foundation work.\nOctober:\u00a0A groundbreaking ceremony began heavy construction.\nNovember and December:\u00a0Foundation support drilling started after test borings. Mass excavation began and utility line work continued. About 85,000 tons of concrete was removed and crushed for new roads.\n2022\nJanuary: Team members\u00a0almost complete the auger cast piles and finish about 25 percent of the structural caissons. Approximately 400 cubic yards of concrete were used for foundation pile caps.\nFebruary:\u00a0Drilling operations continued for more than half of the caissons, and auger piles were nearly completed. More than half the cubic yards of concrete for pile caps were placed, and more than 75 percent of structural steel came onto the fabrication site.\nMarch:\u00a0Installation of the first steel beams and girders. Members positioned and embedded plate girders while work was finished on terminal caissons.\nApril:\u00a0Pile cap and grade beam installation continued. Terminal bridge foundations laid, and road modifications began.\nMay:\u00a0Three-quarters of the pole caps installation was completed. Rebar for underground foundations and the front bridge terminal foundations were installed.\nJune:\u00a0Crews continued to install rebar and lifted steel beams over the train tunnel.\nJuly:\u00a0More than half of the grade beam content and 25 of the 27 embedded plate girders were installed.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Vertical construction began, and crews completed foundation roadwork. Critical construction activities continued, with foundation and concrete work progressing. Workers installed decking, steel and detailing.\nOctober:\u00a0Backfill and excavation continued, and corridor walls were demolished. Bridge piers for elevated highways were installed.\nNovember:\u00a0Completed all structural slabs, and rebar installation continued.\nDecember:\u00a0Team members placed geoform, and tub girders arrived. The first elevated deck slab concrete was installed.\n2023\nAll foundation work was completed on the site of the new terminal at the end of January. There were multiple concrete pours, and more than half of the mechanically stabilized earth walls now are in place.\nEmbracing Pittsburgh\u2019s History\nPittsburgh\u2019s industrial nickname comes from the rise of the steel industry after the Civil War. Increased demand for armament and iron boosted the local economy. Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie introduced the Bessemer steelmaking process, which brought him from obscurity to fame.\nCarnegie began producing steel in 1875. Meanwhile, Henry Clay Frick, the grandson of whiskey distillers, made his riches operating beehive cooking ovens that could turn coal into coke\u2014an essential steelmaking ingredient. Frick later partnered with Carnegie to form Carnegie Steel Co. and, in 1901, they merged multiple companies into the United States Steel Corp.\nBefore they reached their final success, however, a dispute between Carnegie Steel and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers put a dark cloud over the area\u2019s steel production. It led to the Battle of Homestead, an armed conflict that killed 12 people. This event paved the way for modern labor practices and worker-protection laws.\nThrough the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh thrived as America\u2019s eighth-largest city and produced half of the country\u2019s steel. European immigration through Ellis Island led to a population increase of more than 500,000 individuals. The city\u2019s diversity still exists in its various neighborhoods.\nThings changed for Pittsburgh in the 1970s and 1980s when steel production slowed to a stop, and the city had to reinvent itself to survive. It\u2019s now known for technology, energy, medicine, education, research, arts, sports and advanced manufacturing. Its National Football League team, the Steelers, pays tribute to its past in the steel industry. This new terminal aims to do the same. The new terminal at PIT invokes the essence of Pittsburgh through its design focused on Nature, Technology and Community\u2014dubbed NaTeCo by the design team.\nThe terminal modernization progam will pay tribute to the city\u2019s history through art and construction. Steel tree columns are a featured part of the new terminal, creating a nostalgic and stylistic design. Their brownish color is meant to invoke importance of nature in Western Pennsylvania. All of the steel in the new terminal, procured throughout the United States, is being fabricated just 10 miles away from the airport in Ambridge, Pa.\n\n\n(Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nThe Airport Authority also recruited artists Patrick Marold and Adam Kuby to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry through sculptures and other design elements. Other artisans contribute to the terminal through PIT\u2019s Art in the Airport initiative.\nSustainability in the Steel City\nThroughout the years, Pittsburgh made strides to create a healthier, more-sustainable city. From 2015-2020, the Department of City Planning released a yearly \u201cState of Sustainability\u201d report that examined ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize the use of nonrenewable resources.\nNonprofit organization Sustainable Pittsburgh advocates and educates individuals and groups through various initiatives such as recognizing corporations that make efforts toward decarbonization.\nUniversities in the city also are embracing measures to create a greener city. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University and Point Park University each have their own sustainability programs to encourage research and on-campus responsibility.\nThe terminal modernization project is another major step toward creating a Pittsburgh that lives in harmony with its environment.\nTime for an Update\nAllegheny County Airport was the first airport in the region, opening in 1931, and at the time was one of the largest and most advanced terminals of its time. The Greater Pittsburgh Airport opened in 1952, becoming the region\u2019s primary commercial airport. (Allegheny County Airport continues to operate today as a robust general aviation airport with more than 60,000 operations annually.)\nThat terminal existed until 1992, when officials opened the more modern Pittsburgh International Airport, built and designed as a hub for US Airways. US Airways pulled its hub status in 2004, leaving Pittsburgh with a facility built for another time and a different purpose. The airport today offers nonstop service to more than 60 nonstop destinations on 16 airlines, including international service to London Heathrow on British Airways as well service to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\nBoth Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport are operated under the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which has experienced several changes through the years, with the new terminal project being the largest.\nOfficials announced the new terminal in 2017, but construction was put on hold in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project resumed in 2021 and is now making consistent progress. The groundbreaking happened in October 2021, making it the first U.S. terminal built from the ground up after the pandemic.\nTravelers will get the opportunity to enjoy fresh air and greenery while they await their flights. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nManaging Construction\nACAA selected the architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects to lead work on the project. This collaboration ensures international best practices are met without sacrificing local characteristics.\nGensler is headquartered in San Francisco but has multiple Pennsylvania offices and designed the PNC tower downtown. The firm also has airport experience with Incheon Airport. HDR is headquartered in Omaha, Neb., but has an office in Pittsburgh. It replaced the Greenfield Bridge and renovated the Honolulu Airport.\nLuis Vidal completed terminal projects for Heathrow, Madrid-Barajas and other airports.\nBlue Sky News/Pittsburgh International Airport\nTaking in Local Concerns\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project. The terminal modernization has a program advisory group and a best practice group with experts in sustainability, accessibility, passenger experience, technology, health, culture and arts. These members represent constituencies, share their expertise and ensure the authority uses best practices in the new terminal design.\nFeedback was gathered through community and stakeholder meetings, interviews, surveys and the feedback section of the program\u2019s website,\u00a0PITtransformed.com.\nAlthough there are concerns with any project, Pittsburgh\u2019s local \u201cyinzers\u201d are known for being open to sustainable initiatives and creating socioeconomic changes that positively impact the environment, preserving it for future generations. These efforts are known internationally, with the United Nations Foundation recognizing the city as an example of America\u2019s growing sustainability movement.\nManaging the TPM Budget\nWith a high cost comes the need for strict budget management, and the program management team keeps spending under control. No local tax dollars are involved, and most of the construction is funded through long-term bonds, essentially borrowing money and then paying off that debt as part of its yearly operating budget. Paying for the project comes from airport revenues, including airline fees, parking and rental fees, passenger facility charges, terminal concessions revenues, and natural gas revenue.\nNatural Construction and Energy\nLarge windows will produce abundant natural light in the new terminal, minimizing the need for external lighting sources. Outside these windows are expansive outdoor terraces featuring local flora. Using local plants reduces the need for excess water and electricity.\nPlanting local trees, flowers and bushes enables visitors to learn and appreciate native plants, especially when the airport might be the only part of Pennsylvania some travelers see. They also cut carbon emissions by eliminating the need to transport outside flora.\nThe terrace will have chairs for passengers to relax as well as open spaces for kids and pets to run around before getting on their flights.\nOne of the largest changes to the terminal is the private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. These energy sources will power the new terminal, cutting the airport\u2019s carbon footprint and creating a more-sustainable environment. The microgrid is already up and running, powering the existing facility since June 2021. This is significant for the 2030 goal, as construction and demolition projects generate approximately 569 million tons of waste annually.\nThis is advantageous for passengers and airlines, providing a power source when electricity goes out as well as decreasing flight delays. In addition to being more resilient, the microgrid saves PIT more than $1 million annually in utility costs and saves more than 6 million pounds of carbon emissions annually.\nLeading the Way for Sustainability\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s terminal modernization project is the first post-pandemic terminal built from the ground up and holds great promise. Sustainability has always been top of mind, but the ability to continue working toward the 2030 goal after a significant delay shows a commitment to creating a more eco-friendly airport. During the construction delay, PIT designers took that time to incorporate additional public health measures into the project.\nOfficials hope projects can look toward PIT as an example that sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction and local pride can exist in the same place.\u00a0\nAbout Rose Morrison\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies; email: [email\u00a0protected].\nSubscribe\nSubscribe now to receive our FREE print publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject of the Week\n\nFort McHenry Tunnel\nClick here for details and to submit your project!\nCurrent Issue\n\n4th Annual Sustainable Engineering Issue 2024\nPopular Tags\nTwitter Feed\nLocation\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\nRequest More Information From Sponsor\n\n\u0394\n",
    "Summarized_Document": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\n\nFlying is essential for work, vacation, or visiting loved ones, but the aviation industry is not known for being environmentally friendly. Pittsburgh International Airport is seeking to change that with its Terminal Modernization Program (TMP), a $1.4 billion project aimed at creating a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated facilities, better serves passengers, fuels regional development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines, and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe TMP is built on five principles: stabilizing airline costs, being Pittsburgh\u2019s airport, being environmentally sustainable, enhancing the customer experience, and providing value to the community. The new terminal will be located between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. It will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh, making navigation quicker and easier, and reducing the time from curbside to airside by half.\n\nThe modernization project is expected to bring over 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, with that number expected to increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023. The construction practices comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards, targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification. The airport is also recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\n\nThe 2030 Challenge aims for the airport to be carbon-neutral by 2030, with a 90% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025. The new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards. The construction timeline includes significant milestones from 2021 to 2023, with foundation work completed by January 2023.\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s history as a steel city is honored in the new terminal\u2019s design, featuring steel tree columns and other elements that evoke the city\u2019s industrial past. The steel used in the terminal is fabricated locally in Ambridge, PA. The airport also recruited artists to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry.\n\nPittsburgh has made strides in sustainability, with various initiatives and programs from the Department of City Planning, Sustainable Pittsburgh, and local universities. The terminal modernization project is another step toward a more sustainable city.\n\nThe new terminal will feature large windows for natural light, outdoor terraces with local flora, and a private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. This microgrid, operational since June 2021, powers the existing facility and will power the new terminal, saving over $1 million annually in utility costs and reducing carbon emissions by over 6 million pounds annually.\n\nThe project is funded through long-term bonds, airport revenues, and other sources, with no local tax dollars involved. The architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects are leading the project, ensuring international best practices while maintaining local characteristics.\n\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project, incorporating feedback from various stakeholders. The project aims to be an example of how sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction, and local pride can coexist.\n\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies.",

Solar and wind account for more of our nation\u2019s energy mix than ever before.\nTo study America\u2019s growing renewable electricity capacity and generation, Climate Central analyzed historical data on solar and wind energy over a 10-year period (2014 to 2023).\nThe analysis shows that the amount of electricity produced from solar and wind power increased across the U.S. Our nation generated 238,121 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023 \u2014 more than eight times the amount generated a decade earlier in 2014. Wind power has more than doubled this decade, with 425,325 GWh coming from wind installations across the country in 2023. Together, these two renewable energy sources generated enough electricity in 2023 to power the equivalent of more than 61 million average American homes.\nThe most solar power generation came from California (68,816 GWh) and Texas (31,739 GWh) in 2023. Texas also led the country in power generated from wind (119,836 GWh).\nThese data \u2014 combined with federal capacity forecasts \u2014 show how renewable energy growth is driving America\u2019s progress toward net-zero carbon emissions targets in the U.S.\nThis report and supplementary data show:\nHow much solar and wind power increased from 2022 to 2023\nGrowth trends in solar and wind power over the past decade (2014-2023)\nWhich states are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy\nDownload the dataSee the full report\nRelated Climate Matters briefs including state-level graphics:\nA Decade of Solar Growth\nIndex\nIntroductionSolarSolar-powered States in 2023A Decade of Solar Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023WindWind-powered States in 2023A Decade of Wind Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023Clean Energy Growth Relative to U.S. Climate TargetsMethodology\nIntroduction #\nRenewable energy from solar panels and wind turbines is increasingly important in the United States, as costs for these technologies continue to rapidly decline. As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation\u2019s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind \u2013 shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower \u2014 a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\nThe key terms in this report \u2014 capacity and generation \u2014 gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.See Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\nCapacity: measure of the maximum rate at which electricity can be generated by equipment on the ground, reported here in megawatts (MW) for state totals and gigawatts (GW) (equal to 1,000 MW) for national totals.\nGeneration: the amount of electricity produced over a period of time, reported here in gigawatt-hours (GWh) (equal to 1,000 megawatt-hours). For reference, the average American household consumed 10.8 MWh of electricity in 2022.\nSmall-scale installations: power operations with less than 1 MW of capacity, usually located onsite or near where the electricity is used (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels or community solar projects). Note: The only small-scale installations discussed in this report are for solar power.\nUtility-scale installations: power plants with at least 1 MW of capacity.\nLearn more about U.S. electricity capacity and generation from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n01 / 01\nSOLAR #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations \u2014 an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\nUtility-scale solar accounts for around 8% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables, nuclear, [1] and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas). In 2023, nearly4% of electricity in the U.S. was produced by utility-scale solar. A decade earlier in 2014, it accounted for less than 0.5% of the total electricity generated.\nCalifornia and Nevada are among the states for which utility-scale solar comprises a significant portion of the current electricity mix. In 2023, utility-scale solar contributed 19% (40,714 GWh) of electricity in California and 23% (9,733 GWh) of the electricity in Nevada.\nNevada\u2019s capacity for solar power is projected to increase during 2024, as the Gemini solar facility is scheduled to come online. The facility will add a planned 690 MW of solar capacity and 380 MW of battery storage \u2013 which is one way solar power facilities can capture and store some energy to meet evening electricity demand. It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada.

In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\n01 / 03\nSolar-powered States in 2023 #\nThe states with the most solar capacity in 2023 (combined utility- and small-scale) were California, with 36,461 MW, Texas (18,476 MW), Florida (10,352 MW), North Carolina (7,150 MW), and Arizona (5,848 MW).\nThese same five states also generated the most electricity from solar power (utility- and small-scale combined) in 2023 (Figure 1): California (68,816 GWh); Texas (31,739 GWh); Florida (17,809 GWh); North Carolina (12,085 GWh); and Arizona (11,778 GWh).\nTexas led the nation in growth from 2022 to 2023 for both solar capacity and generation (Table 1). Texas added 4,996 MW of capacity (37% annual increase) and generated 6,302 GWh more than the previous year (25% annual increase).\nCalifornia followed with an addition of 4,714 MW of solar capacity \u2014 a 15% increase from 2022. The state produced 5,906 GWh more (9% increase) than the year before.\nState\nSolar Capacity (MW) 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2022 to 2023\nSolar Generation (GWh) 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2022 to 2023\nCalifornia\n36,461\n15%\n68,816\n9%\nTexas\n18,476\n37%\n31,739\n25%\nFlorida\n10,352\n33%\n17,809\n28%\nNorth Carolina\n7,150\n11%\n12,085\n2%\nArizona\n5,848\n14%\n11,778\n6%\nUnited States total\n139,012\n23%\n238,121\n16%\nA Decade of Solar Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\nThe U.S. added more than 121 GW of utility- and small-scale solar capacity in total during the last decade \u2014 an increase of around 688% (Figure 2). This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2). Present-day data on solar capacity and generation reflect these strong historical growth trends, as these states were among the highest solar-generating states in 2023.\nState\nSolar Capacity Growth (MW)\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Generation Growth (GWh)\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2014 to 2023\nCalifornia\n27,864\n324%\n54,210\n371%\nTexas\n18,179\n6,124%\n31,293\n7,016%\nFlorida\n10,203\n6,858%\n17,448\n4,833%\nNorth Carolina\n6,416\n874%\n11,282\n1,405%\nNevada\n4,313\n647%\n10,305\n922%\nUnited States total\n121,363\n688%\n209,197\n723%\nSolar and wind installations produce energy daily, year-round. Seasonal weather plays an important role. The amount of electricity generated is influenced, in part, by when the sun shines or the wind blows.\nSolar generation in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when days are long and the sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly. In 2023, solar electricity produced from utility- and small-scale installations (combined) peaked (Figure 3) in July (26,626 GWh) and August (25,372 GWh).\nWind energy generation is typically highest during the spring. In 2023, the most wind energy was produced across the U.S. in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh) (Figure 4).\n01 / 01\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023. During 2023, U.S. solar electricity generation peaked in July (26,626 GWh).\nClimate Central\u2019s WeatherPower\u2122 tool produces daily estimates and forecasts of local solar and wind generation across the continental U.S. Daily forecasts from WeatherPower reflect the influence of weather on local solar and wind generation. WeatherPower data provide a snapshot of solar and wind energy across the U.S., at local scales, on any given day. It can be used to generate figures relevant to any state, media market, county, or congressional district in the continental U.S.\nThis WeatherPower graphic shows estimates and forecasts for solar generation in North Carolina in March 2024.\nWIND #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from utility-scale onshore and offshore wind installations \u2014 an increase of 6 GW or 4% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 425,235 GWh of electricity from utility-scale wind installations. This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country. However coastal states can take advantage of offshore winds to generate electricity. Offshore wind currently makes up a small portion of the national electricity mix, but it has the potential to grow substantially in the coming decades.\nIn 2023, only two states (Rhode Island and Virginia) had operational offshore wind facilities, which contributed 42 MW to the total national wind capacity (148 GW). Offshore wind capacity has already grown early in 2024. Vineyard Wind, a wind installation off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, began operating in February 2024 with 68 MW of capacity. This facility will have 800 MW of capacity when fully operational, which could happen as soon as late 2024. In March 2024, South Fork Wind Farm off the coasts of New York and Rhode Island began operating with around 130 MW of capacity \u2014 making it the country\u2019s largest operational offshore wind installation.\nRising costs have challenged the economic viability of offshore wind installations, delaying some projects. Financial incentives such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act could ease some of the economic burden. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, state policies are poised to support development of nearly 43 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040. Offshore wind projects across more than a dozen coastal states are in various stages of approval or construction.\nLearn more about offshore wind in the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Offshore Wind Market Report: 2023 Edition\nWind accounts for around 12% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas).\nIn 2023, around 10%of electricity in the U.S. was produced by wind. A decade earlier in 2014, wind accounted for 4% of the total electricity generated.\nThe EIA forecasts that electricity generation from wind will grow by 6% in 2024, while coal and natural gas will continue to decline.\nFor Iowa and South Dakota, wind comprises more than half of the current electricity mix. In 2023, wind generated almost 60% (41,869 GWh) of electricity in Iowa and about 55% (9,389 GWh) in South Dakota.\nAlthough Texas leads the way in wind power \u2014 generating almost three times more than the next biggest wind energy-producing state \u2014 electricity generated from wind made up a more modest 22% of the Texas\u2019 electricity mix in 2023.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country.

As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).Solar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\nMethodology #\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA\u2019s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA\u2019s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA\u2019s electricity data browser.\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people\u2019s lives.\nClimate Central is a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nNewsletter signup\nLooking for Climate Matters?

The report 'A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power: Trends Across the U.S.' shows that America's capacity to generate carbon-free electricity grew during 2023, with solar and wind accounting for more of the energy mix than ever before. In 2023, the U.S. generated 238,121 GWh of electricity from solar, more than eight times the amount in 2014. Wind power more than doubled, with 425,325 GWh generated in 2023. California and Texas were the top producers of solar power, with 68,816 GWh and 31,739 GWh respectively. Texas also led in wind power with 119,836 GWh. The report includes data on solar and wind power increases from 2022 to 2023, growth trends over the past decade, and the biggest producers of solar and wind energy. By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 GW from solar installations, a 23% increase from 2022. Small-scale solar installations accounted for 48 GW of this capacity. California generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023. Utility-scale solar contributed 19% of California's electricity in 2023. The Gemini solar facility in Nevada is expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational. Wind energy generation in the U.S. peaked in March 2023 with 44,580 GWh. By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from wind installations. Offshore wind capacity grew early in 2024 with the Vineyard Wind and South Fork Wind Farm projects. Wind accounted for around 12% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources in 2023. Texas led in wind capacity and generation growth from 2022 to 2023. The U.S. added more than 83 GW of wind capacity during the last decade, an increase of around 130%. The U.S. aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. Recent laws like the Inflation Reduction Act are fostering renewable energy growth. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states.",

Solar and wind account for more of our nation\u2019s energy mix than ever before.\nTo study America\u2019s growing renewable electricity capacity and generation, Climate Central analyzed historical data on solar and wind energy over a 10-year period (2014 to 2023).\nThe analysis shows that the amount of electricity produced from solar and wind power increased across the U.S. Our nation generated 238,121 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023 \u2014 more than eight times the amount generated a decade earlier in 2014. Wind power has more than doubled this decade, with 425,325 GWh coming from wind installations across the country in 2023. Together, these two renewable energy sources generated enough electricity in 2023 to power the equivalent of more than 61 million average American homes.\nThe most solar power generation came from California (68,816 GWh) and Texas (31,739 GWh) in 2023. Texas also led the country in power generated from wind (119,836 GWh).\nThese data \u2014 combined with federal capacity forecasts \u2014 show how renewable energy growth is driving America\u2019s progress toward net-zero carbon emissions targets in the U.S.\nThis report and supplementary data show:\nHow much solar and wind power increased from 2022 to 2023\nGrowth trends in solar and wind power over the past decade (2014-2023)\nWhich states are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy\nDownload the dataSee the full report\nRelated Climate Matters briefs including state-level graphics:\nA Decade of Solar Growth\nIndex\nIntroductionSolarSolar-powered States in 2023A Decade of Solar Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023WindWind-powered States in 2023A Decade of Wind Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023Clean Energy Growth Relative to U.S. Climate TargetsMethodology\nIntroduction #\nRenewable energy from solar panels and wind turbines is increasingly important in the United States, as costs for these technologies continue to rapidly decline. As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation\u2019s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind \u2013 shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower \u2014 a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\nThe key terms in this report \u2014 capacity and generation \u2014 gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.See Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\nCapacity: measure of the maximum rate at which electricity can be generated by equipment on the ground, reported here in megawatts (MW) for state totals and gigawatts (GW) (equal to 1,000 MW) for national totals.\nGeneration: the amount of electricity produced over a period of time, reported here in gigawatt-hours (GWh) (equal to 1,000 megawatt-hours). For reference, the average American household consumed 10.8 MWh of electricity in 2022.\nSmall-scale installations: power operations with less than 1 MW of capacity, usually located onsite or near where the electricity is used (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels or community solar projects). Note: The only small-scale installations discussed in this report are for solar power.\nUtility-scale installations: power plants with at least 1 MW of capacity.\nLearn more about U.S. electricity capacity and generation from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n01 / 01\nSOLAR #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations \u2014 an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\nUtility-scale solar accounts for around 8% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables, nuclear, [1] and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas). In 2023, nearly4% of electricity in the U.S. was produced by utility-scale solar. A decade earlier in 2014, it accounted for less than 0.5% of the total electricity generated.\nCalifornia and Nevada are among the states for which utility-scale solar comprises a significant portion of the current electricity mix. In 2023, utility-scale solar contributed 19% (40,714 GWh) of electricity in California and 23% (9,733 GWh) of the electricity in Nevada.\nNevada\u2019s capacity for solar power is projected to increase during 2024, as the Gemini solar facility is scheduled to come online. The facility will add a planned 690 MW of solar capacity and 380 MW of battery storage \u2013 which is one way solar power facilities can capture and store some energy to meet evening electricity demand. It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada. Climate Central's Partnership Journalism program collaborated with the Mountain West News Bureau to investigate how Nevada is leading the way for renewable energy workforce development.\nRead the full story.\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity.

Texas added 4,996 MW of capacity (37% annual increase) and generated 6,302 GWh more than the previous year (25% annual increase).\nCalifornia followed with an addition of 4,714 MW of solar capacity \u2014 a 15% increase from 2022. The state produced 5,906 GWh more (9% increase) than the year before.\nState\nSolar Capacity (MW) 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2022 to 2023\nSolar Generation (GWh) 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2022 to 2023\nCalifornia\n36,461\n15%\n68,816\n9%\nTexas\n18,476\n37%\n31,739\n25%\nFlorida\n10,352\n33%\n17,809\n28%\nNorth Carolina\n7,150\n11%\n12,085\n2%\nArizona\n5,848\n14%\n11,778\n6%\nUnited States total\n139,012\n23%\n238,121\n16%\nA Decade of Solar Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\nThe U.S. added more than 121 GW of utility- and small-scale solar capacity in total during the last decade \u2014 an increase of around 688% (Figure 2). This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2).

Seasonal weather plays an important role. The amount of electricity generated is influenced, in part, by when the sun shines or the wind blows.\nSolar generation in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when days are long and the sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly. In 2023, solar electricity produced from utility- and small-scale installations (combined) peaked (Figure 3) in July (26,626 GWh) and August (25,372 GWh).\nWind energy generation is typically highest during the spring. In 2023, the most wind energy was produced across the U.S. in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh) (Figure 4).\n01 / 01\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023.

It can be used to generate figures relevant to any state, media market, county, or congressional district in the continental U.S.\nThis WeatherPower graphic shows estimates and forecasts for solar generation in North Carolina in March 2024.\nWIND #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from utility-scale onshore and offshore wind installations \u2014 an increase of 6 GW or 4% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 425,235 GWh of electricity from utility-scale wind installations. This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country. However coastal states can take advantage of offshore winds to generate electricity. Offshore wind currently makes up a small portion of the national electricity mix, but it has the potential to grow substantially in the coming decades.\nIn 2023, only two states (Rhode Island and Virginia) had operational offshore wind facilities, which contributed 42 MW to the total national wind capacity (148 GW). Offshore wind capacity has already grown early in 2024. Vineyard Wind, a wind installation off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, began operating in February 2024 with 68 MW of capacity. This facility will have 800 MW of capacity when fully operational, which could happen as soon as late 2024. In March 2024, South Fork Wind Farm off the coasts of New York and Rhode Island began operating with around 130 MW of capacity \u2014 making it the country\u2019s largest operational offshore wind installation.\nRising costs have challenged the economic viability of offshore wind installations, delaying some projects. Financial incentives such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act could ease some of the economic burden. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, state policies are poised to support development of nearly 43 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040.

As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).Solar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\nMethodology #\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA\u2019s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA\u2019s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA\u2019s electricity data browser.\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people\u2019s lives.\nClimate Central is a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nNewsletter signup\nLooking for Climate Matters?

Climate Matters helps meteorologists and journalists report on climate impacts and solutions. The Partnership Journalism program collaborates with local newsrooms nationwide. A report from April 3, 2024, titled 'A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power: Trends Across the U.S.' shows that America's capacity to generate carbon-free electricity grew during 2023. Solar and wind energy have seen significant growth over the past decade. In 2023, the U.S. generated 238,121 GWh from solar and 425,325 GWh from wind. Texas led the country in wind power generation with 119,836 GWh in 2023. The report also highlights the increase in solar and wind power from 2022 to 2023, growth trends over the past decade, and the states that are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy. The U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 GW from solar and 148 GW from wind by the end of 2023. Solar generation peaked in July and August 2023, while wind generation was highest in March and April 2023. Texas generated 119,836 GWh of wind energy in 2023, with the most wind energy produced in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh). The EIA forecasts that electricity generation from wind will grow by 6% in 2024. Offshore wind capacity is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades. The U.S. aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, and achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.

As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation\u2019s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind \u2013 shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower \u2014 a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\nThe key terms in this report \u2014 capacity and generation \u2014 gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.See Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\nCapacity: measure of the maximum rate at which electricity can be generated by equipment on the ground, reported here in megawatts (MW) for state totals and gigawatts (GW) (equal to 1,000 MW) for national totals.\nGeneration: the amount of electricity produced over a period of time, reported here in gigawatt-hours (GWh) (equal to 1,000 megawatt-hours). For reference, the average American household consumed 10.8 MWh of electricity in 2022.\nSmall-scale installations: power operations with less than 1 MW of capacity, usually located onsite or near where the electricity is used (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels or community solar projects). Note: The only small-scale installations discussed in this report are for solar power.\nUtility-scale installations: power plants with at least 1 MW of capacity.\nLearn more about U.S. electricity capacity and generation from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n01 / 01\nSOLAR #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations \u2014 an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\nUtility-scale solar accounts for around 8% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables, nuclear, [1] and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas). In 2023, nearly4% of electricity in the U.S. was produced by utility-scale solar. A decade earlier in 2014, it accounted for less than 0.5% of the total electricity generated.\nCalifornia and Nevada are among the states for which utility-scale solar comprises a significant portion of the current electricity mix. In 2023, utility-scale solar contributed 19% (40,714 GWh) of electricity in California and 23% (9,733 GWh) of the electricity in Nevada.\nNevada\u2019s capacity for solar power is projected to increase during 2024, as the Gemini solar facility is scheduled to come online. The facility will add a planned 690 MW of solar capacity and 380 MW of battery storage \u2013 which is one way solar power facilities can capture and store some energy to meet evening electricity demand. It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada. Climate Central's Partnership Journalism program collaborated with the Mountain West News Bureau to investigate how Nevada is leading the way for renewable energy workforce development.\nRead the full story.\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity.

It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada. Climate Central's Partnership Journalism program collaborated with the Mountain West News Bureau to investigate how Nevada is leading the way for renewable energy workforce development.\nRead the full story.\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\n01 / 03\nSolar-powered States in 2023 #\nThe states with the most solar capacity in 2023 (combined utility- and small-scale) were California, with 36,461 MW, Texas (18,476 MW), Florida (10,352 MW), North Carolina (7,150 MW), and Arizona (5,848 MW).\nThese same five states also generated the most electricity from solar power (utility- and small-scale combined) in 2023 (Figure 1): California (68,816 GWh); Texas (31,739 GWh); Florida (17,809 GWh); North Carolina (12,085 GWh); and Arizona (11,778 GWh).\nTexas led the nation in growth from 2022 to 2023 for both solar capacity and generation (Table 1). Texas added 4,996 MW of capacity (37% annual increase) and generated 6,302 GWh more than the previous year (25% annual increase).\nCalifornia followed with an addition of 4,714 MW of solar capacity \u2014 a 15% increase from 2022. The state produced 5,906 GWh more (9% increase) than the year before.\nState\nSolar Capacity (MW) 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2022 to 2023\nSolar Generation (GWh) 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2022 to 2023\nCalifornia\n36,461\n15%\n68,816\n9%\nTexas\n18,476\n37%\n31,739\n25%\nFlorida\n10,352\n33%\n17,809\n28%\nNorth Carolina\n7,150\n11%\n12,085\n2%\nArizona\n5,848\n14%\n11,778\n6%\nUnited States total\n139,012\n23%\n238,121\n16%\nA Decade of Solar Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\nThe U.S. added more than 121 GW of utility- and small-scale solar capacity in total during the last decade \u2014 an increase of around 688% (Figure 2). This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2). Present-day data on solar capacity and generation reflect these strong historical growth trends, as these states were among the highest solar-generating states in 2023.\nState\nSolar Capacity Growth (MW)\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Generation Growth (GWh)\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2014 to 2023\nCalifornia\n27,864\n324%\n54,210\n371%\nTexas\n18,179\n6,124%\n31,293\n7,016%\nFlorida\n10,203\n6,858%\n17,448\n4,833%\nNorth Carolina\n6,416\n874%\n11,282\n1,405%\nNevada\n4,313\n647%\n10,305\n922%\nUnited States total\n121,363\n688%\n209,197\n723%\nSolar and wind installations produce energy daily, year-round. Seasonal weather plays an important role. The amount of electricity generated is influenced, in part, by when the sun shines or the wind blows.\nSolar generation in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when days are long and the sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly. In 2023, solar electricity produced from utility- and small-scale installations (combined) peaked (Figure 3) in July (26,626 GWh) and August (25,372 GWh).\nWind energy generation is typically highest during the spring. In 2023, the most wind energy was produced across the U.S. in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh) (Figure 4).\n01 / 01\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023. During 2023, U.S. solar electricity generation peaked in July (26,626 GWh).\nClimate Central\u2019s WeatherPower\u2122 tool produces daily estimates and forecasts of local solar and wind generation across the continental U.S. Daily forecasts from WeatherPower reflect the influence of weather on local solar and wind generation. WeatherPower data provide a snapshot of solar and wind energy across the U.S., at local scales, on any given day. It can be used to generate figures relevant to any state, media market, county, or congressional district in the continental U.S.\nThis WeatherPower graphic shows estimates and forecasts for solar generation in North Carolina in March 2024.\nWIND #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from utility-scale onshore and offshore wind installations \u2014 an increase of 6 GW or 4% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 425,235 GWh of electricity from utility-scale wind installations. This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country. However coastal states can take advantage of offshore winds to generate electricity. Offshore wind currently makes up a small portion of the national electricity mix, but it has the potential to grow substantially in the coming decades.\nIn 2023, only two states (Rhode Island and Virginia) had operational offshore wind facilities, which contributed 42 MW to the total national wind capacity (148 GW). Offshore wind capacity has already grown early in 2024. Vineyard Wind, a wind installation off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, began operating in February 2024 with 68 MW of capacity. This facility will have 800 MW of capacity when fully operational, which could happen as soon as late 2024. In March 2024, South Fork Wind Farm off the coasts of New York and Rhode Island began operating with around 130 MW of capacity \u2014 making it the country\u2019s largest operational offshore wind installation.\nRising costs have challenged the economic viability of offshore wind installations, delaying some projects. Financial incentives such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act could ease some of the economic burden. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, state policies are poised to support development of nearly 43 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040. Offshore wind projects across more than a dozen coastal states are in various stages of approval or construction.\nLearn more about offshore wind in the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Offshore Wind Market Report: 2023 Edition\nWind accounts for around 12% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas).\nIn 2023, around 10%of electricity in the U.S. was produced by wind. A decade earlier in 2014, wind accounted for 4% of the total electricity generated.\nThe EIA forecasts that electricity generation from wind will grow by 6% in 2024, while coal and natural gas will continue to decline.\nFor Iowa and South Dakota, wind comprises more than half of the current electricity mix.

As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).Solar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\nMethodology #\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA\u2019s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA\u2019s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA\u2019s electricity data browser.\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people\u2019s lives.\nClimate Central is a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nNewsletter signup\nLooking for Climate Matters?

Climate Matters helps meteorologists and journalists report on climate impacts and solutions. The Partnership Journalism program collaborates with local newsrooms nationwide. A report from April 3, 2024, titled 'A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power: Trends Across the U.S.' shows that America's capacity to generate carbon-free electricity grew during 2023. Solar and wind energy have seen significant growth over the past decade. In 2023, the U.S. generated 238,121 GWh from solar and 425,325 GWh from wind. Texas led the country in wind power generation with 119,836 GWh in 2023. The report also highlights the increase in solar and wind power from 2022 to 2023, growth trends over the past decade, and the states that are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy. The U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 GW from solar and 148 GW from wind by the end of 2023. Solar generation peaked in July and August 2023, while wind generation was highest in March and April 2023. Texas generated 119,836 GWh of wind energy in 2023, with the most wind energy produced in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh). The EIA forecasts that electricity generation from wind will grow by 6% in 2024. Offshore wind capacity is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades. The U.S. aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, and achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, Amazon Studios, and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by Amazon.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, Amazon Studios, and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by Amazon.

Today, we will delve deep into eBay revenue throughout the years, eBay sales statistics by category, and much more.\nOn this page\nWhen Was eBay Established?\nEstablished in 1995 as a platform for auction-style sales, eBay swiftly expanded its horizons, becoming a global marketplace for both new and second-hand items. Today, its influence stretches across continents, reaching millions of buyers and sellers alike. The statistics provided in this article are intended to give eBay sellers with insight into potential eBay selling opportunities.\nMake Money Selling on eBay!\neBay Statistic Overview\nOnline marketplaces have revolutionized the way we shop, offering a wide array of products at our fingertips. A recent study by Statista sheds light on the dominance and reach of these platforms in the U.S. market as of April 2023.\nAmazon is at the top of the list, with a whopping 58.03% share of online visits. Trailing behind, but still maintaining a strong presence, is eBay with a 13.11% share. The results demonstrate eBay\u2019s enduring relevance, even in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.\nWalmart also maintains its lead in the online market with a 6.53% share, demonstrating its successful transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a significant online player. Etsy, known for unique and handmade items, accounted for 5.02% of visits.\nLastly, Target, another retail giant, holds a 2.64% share, underscoring its efforts to boost its online footprint. These eBay stats emphasize the competitive nature of online retail and highlight the importance of innovation and customer engagement in retaining and growing market share.\nMORE: How to increase sales on eBay\nWhat Does This Mean for eBay Sellers?\nFirst and foremost, despite the towering presence of Amazon, eBay still commands a respectable 13.11% share of online visits as of April 2023. This indicates that eBay remains a formidable platform with a vast and engaged customer base. Sellers can leverage this large audience to diversify their online presence and reach a different segment of buyers.\nHowever, the competition is fierce. With Amazon dominating the market, eCommerce sellers must bring their A-game when listing on eBay. This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\nMORE: How to sell on eBay and make money\neBay Seller Statistics\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\neCommerce\u2019s Share of Total Retail Sales in the US\nMORE: eBay vacation mode\neBay Advertising Statistics\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\nMORE: How to set up an eBay store\neBay Buyer Statistics\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\nMORE: How to issue partial refund on eBay\nHow Many People Use eBay\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\nNumber of eBay total active buyers from 1st Quarter 2010 to 2nd Quarter 2023 (in millions)\nA Shift After 2018\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\nMORE: eBay seller help\nMORE: eBay refurbished\neBay Website Traffic Share\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States.

An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\nMORE: eBay selling tips\nMORE: eBay selling limits\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023.

Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend.

Today, we will delve deep into eBay revenue throughout the years, eBay sales statistics by category, and much more.\nOn this page\nWhen Was eBay Established?\nEstablished in 1995 as a platform for auction-style sales, eBay swiftly expanded its horizons, becoming a global marketplace for both new and second-hand items. Today, its influence stretches across continents, reaching millions of buyers and sellers alike. The statistics provided in this article are intended to give eBay sellers with insight into potential eBay selling opportunities.\nMake Money Selling on eBay!\neBay Statistic Overview\nOnline marketplaces have revolutionized the way we shop, offering a wide array of products at our fingertips. A recent study by Statista sheds light on the dominance and reach of these platforms in the U.S. market as of April 2023.\nAmazon is at the top of the list, with a whopping 58.03% share of online visits. Trailing behind, but still maintaining a strong presence, is eBay with a 13.11% share. The results demonstrate eBay\u2019s enduring relevance, even in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.\nWalmart also maintains its lead in the online market with a 6.53% share, demonstrating its successful transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a significant online player. Etsy, known for unique and handmade items, accounted for 5.02% of visits.\nLastly, Target, another retail giant, holds a 2.64% share, underscoring its efforts to boost its online footprint. These eBay stats emphasize the competitive nature of online retail and highlight the importance of innovation and customer engagement in retaining and growing market share.\nMORE: How to increase sales on eBay\nWhat Does This Mean for eBay Sellers?\nFirst and foremost, despite the towering presence of Amazon, eBay still commands a respectable 13.11% share of online visits as of April 2023. This indicates that eBay remains a formidable platform with a vast and engaged customer base. Sellers can leverage this large audience to diversify their online presence and reach a different segment of buyers.\nHowever, the competition is fierce. With Amazon dominating the market, eCommerce sellers must bring their A-game when listing on eBay. This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\nMORE: How to sell on eBay and make money\neBay Seller Statistics\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\neCommerce\u2019s Share of Total Retail Sales in the US\nMORE: eBay vacation mode\neBay Advertising Statistics\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\nMORE: How to set up an eBay store\neBay Buyer Statistics\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\nMORE: How to issue partial refund on eBay\nHow Many People Use eBay\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\nNumber of eBay total active buyers from 1st Quarter 2010 to 2nd Quarter 2023 (in millions)\nA Shift After 2018\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\nMORE: eBay seller help\nMORE: eBay refurbished\neBay Website Traffic Share\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States.

An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\nMORE: eBay selling tips\nMORE: eBay selling limits\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023.

Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend.

Today, we will delve deep into eBay revenue throughout the years, eBay sales statistics by category, and much more.\nOn this page\nWhen Was eBay Established?\nEstablished in 1995 as a platform for auction-style sales, eBay swiftly expanded its horizons, becoming a global marketplace for both new and second-hand items. Today, its influence stretches across continents, reaching millions of buyers and sellers alike. The statistics provided in this article are intended to give eBay sellers with insight into potential eBay selling opportunities.\nMake Money Selling on eBay!\neBay Statistic Overview\nOnline marketplaces have revolutionized the way we shop, offering a wide array of products at our fingertips. A recent study by Statista sheds light on the dominance and reach of these platforms in the U.S. market as of April 2023.\nAmazon is at the top of the list, with a whopping 58.03% share of online visits. Trailing behind, but still maintaining a strong presence, is eBay with a 13.11% share. The results demonstrate eBay\u2019s enduring relevance, even in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.\nWalmart also maintains its lead in the online market with a 6.53% share, demonstrating its successful transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a significant online player. Etsy, known for unique and handmade items, accounted for 5.02% of visits.\nLastly, Target, another retail giant, holds a 2.64% share, underscoring its efforts to boost its online footprint. These eBay stats emphasize the competitive nature of online retail and highlight the importance of innovation and customer engagement in retaining and growing market share.\nMORE: How to increase sales on eBay\nWhat Does This Mean for eBay Sellers?\nFirst and foremost, despite the towering presence of Amazon, eBay still commands a respectable 13.11% share of online visits as of April 2023. This indicates that eBay remains a formidable platform with a vast and engaged customer base. Sellers can leverage this large audience to diversify their online presence and reach a different segment of buyers.\nHowever, the competition is fierce. With Amazon dominating the market, eCommerce sellers must bring their A-game when listing on eBay. This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\nMORE: How to sell on eBay and make money\neBay Seller Statistics\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\neCommerce\u2019s Share of Total Retail Sales in the US\nMORE: eBay vacation mode\neBay Advertising Statistics\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\nMORE: How to set up an eBay store\neBay Buyer Statistics\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\nMORE: How to issue partial refund on eBay\nHow Many People Use eBay\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\nNumber of eBay total active buyers from 1st Quarter 2010 to 2nd Quarter 2023 (in millions)\nA Shift After 2018\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\nMORE: eBay seller help\nMORE: eBay refurbished\neBay Website Traffic Share\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States.

An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\nMORE: eBay selling tips\nMORE: eBay selling limits\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023.

Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend. Thus, sellers need a strategic, adaptive, and diversified approach to maximize their reach and sales in this ever-evolving market.\nMORE: Discover Amazon Statistics.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nHow popular is eBay now?\nWhat age group uses eBay the most?\nIs eBay getting less popular?\nWho is eBay's target audience?\nWho is the #1 seller on eBay?\nAuthor\nDominika Kaminska\nAmazing content you need, amazing content we deliver.

However, in other examined countries, most users showed a preference for mobile browsing.\n\neBay\u2019s Second-Hand Purchase Trend\n\nAnother important buyer statistic is the share of eBay buyers purchasing second-hand goods in order to save money in 2022.\n\nThe appeal of online marketplaces like eBay is frequently based on the diverse range of products they offer, which varies from brand-new items to second-hand or used goods. An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\n\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\n\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\n\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\n\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\n\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023. During the observed time frame, the highest monthly downloads worldwide occurred in January 2021, reaching 3.4 million for that month.\n\neBay Sales Statistics by Category\n\nIn February 2021, nearly a year after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable face masks dominated eBay sales, averaging over 293 items sold for each listing every week. Mobile phones and smartphones also ranked high in sales, with listings selling an average of 76 units weekly.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIn the rapidly shifting eCommerce landscape, sellers must remain agile and informed. Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\n\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend. Thus, sellers need a strategic, adaptive, and diversified approach to maximize their reach and sales in this ever-evolving market.",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\u00a0\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates. The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\u00a0\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\u00a0\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\r\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\r\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\n\nShopify Inc.\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\nShopify Inc.\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\nShopify Inc.\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\n\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\n\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates. The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

    "Document": "Alibaba Group\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue grew 7% year-over-year to RMB221.87 billion ($30.73 billion), edging ahead of forecasts as it notched wins across its core e-commerce and cloud businesses.\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31 outpaced Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimate of approximately RMB219.80 billion, while revenue for the 2024 fiscal year rose 8% year-over-year to RMB941.17 billion.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen early results from increased investment in our strategic business priorities and are confident in our business outlook,\u201d said Toby Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group.\nAlibaba\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) for the quarter decreased 5% year-over-year to RMB23.97 billion, primarily due to increased investment in its e-commerce businesses and one-time retention incentives for employees of logistics arm Cainiao. Quarterly non-GAAP net income declined 11% year-over-year to RMB24.42 billion.\nAlibaba increased its capital expenditure on Alibaba Cloud infrastructure and its Chinese and cross-border e-commerce businesses, leading to double-digit growth across key metrics including gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that our strategies are working and we are returning to growth,\u201d said Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.\nThe company also announced a $4.0 billion dividend distribution to continuously enhance shareholder return.\nAlibaba\u2019s e-commerce businesses recorded an uptick in purchasing frequency and customer retention over the quarter, even as retail growth slowed in China.\nAcross the country, total retail sales of consumer goods in March grew 3.1% year-over-year, trailing the 5.5% and 7.4% growth recorded in the January-February and December periods, respectively, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.\nDespite the broader slowdown, revenue during the latest quarter grew 4% year-on-year to RMB93.22 billion at Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG).\nTTG\u2019s adjusted EBITA shrank slightly to RMB38.5 billion compared to RMB39.04 billion in the same quarter of 2023, as the business increased strategic investment in areas including customer service, membership program benefits and technology.\n\u201cOur China and international commerce businesses realized double-digit year-over-year GMV growth through our focus on the customer experience,\u201d said Wu, who stepped into the role of Taobao and Tmall Group CEO last year.\nHe has emphasized that 2024 would be a year of strategic upgrades and significant investment into the core businesses, and it has started to bear fruit.\nOnline gross merchandise value \u2013 excluding unpaid orders \u2013 and order growth expanded by double-digits year-over-year, fueling a 5% increase in customer management revenue.\nMembership in TTG\u2019s 88VIP loyalty program increased by double digits year-over-year in the quarter to top 35 million members, as consumers were enticed by improving service and more benefits.\nTaobao has introduced more user-friendly measures including a simplified 6.18 sales structure and a website update. Likewise, Tmall announced plans to triple the scale of resources dedicated to new products.\nBetween January and March, the number of new merchants on Tmall rose 60% year-over-year, while the total transaction volume of new merchants over this time increased by 150% compared with last year.\nQuarterly revenue from the company\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group rose 3% to RMB25.60 billion, driven by the double-digit growth of its public cloud business.\nAlibaba Cloud\u2019s public cloud offerings are available online for organizations and individuals alike, and include elastic compute, database and AI products and services. The company saw triple-digit growth in AI-related revenue in the fourth quarter.\nTo attract start-ups and small businesses that will support long-term growth, Alibaba recently slashed the price of over 100 core public cloud products in the Chinese market.\nIn April, the company also extended these cost reductions to international customers, with an average price reduction of 23%.\n\u201cWe are excited by the accelerated growth of customers and cloud computing revenues related to our AI products. We will remain focused on our strategic priorities and capture future growth opportunities,\u201d said Wu.\nOver 90,000 enterprises have adopted Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen large language model (LLM) since it debuted a year ago, on top of more than 7 million downloads on open-source platforms like Github.\nAlibaba Cloud recently launched a service to help companies customize and scale generative AI models, from consolidating multiple models to optimizing underlying infrastructure resources.\nIn addition, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI-driven sustainability platform Energy Expert rolled out an open API service enabling developers to build customized sustainability applications.\nIts AI computing platform for high-performance computing tasks, PAI-Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service, became available in Singapore for the first time this year.\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) marketplaces notched a 20% increase in combined orders for the latest quarter as revenue grew 45% year-over-year to RMB27.45 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nCross-border retail platform AliExpress provides price-competitive products and efficient fulfillment under its Choice service, which accounted for around 70% of AliExpress\u2019s total orders in April 2024.\nIncreased synergies between AliExpress and Cainiao led five to ten-day delivery completion rates to double year-over-year for Choice orders over the quarter.\nCainiao, which withdrew its plan to make an initial public offering on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange in March partly to focus on supporting cross-border fulfillment services within AIDC, has also gone from strength to strength.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue from Cainiao grew 30% year-over-year to RMB24.56 billion. Cainiao\u2019s five to ten-day delivery service extended into four additional countries during the quarter, bringing the number of countries covered by the premium service to 14.\nInvestment in cross-border initiatives ramped up across the board in the fourth quarter.\nTurkish online retailer Trendyol expanded into the Gulf region and has become one of the region\u2019s most downloaded e-commerce apps. At the same time, AliExpress earmarked millions of euros for discounts and deals as part of an exclusive global sponsorship of the upcoming UEFA European Football Championship set for this summer.\nAs a result of increased investment in key markets to enhance customer experience and expand consumer base, AIDC posted a loss of RMB4.09 billion in the quarter for adjusted EBITA.\nAs part of management\u2019s commitment to delivering value to shareholders, Alibaba has announced a two-part dividend worth an aggregate $4.0 billion.\nThe Alibaba board approved an annual regular cash dividend for the most recent fiscal year and an extraordinary cash dividend comprised of proceeds from the disposition of certain financial investments.\nThe one-time extraordinary dividend will come to $0.0825 per ordinary share or $0.66 per ADS and will be paid in U.S. dollars to holders of ordinary shares and ADSs as of the close of business on June 13, 2024, Hong Kong Time and New York Time, respectively.\n\u201cWe are committed to continuing to return value to our shareholders,\u201d said Alibaba\u2019s Xu.\nEarlier this year, the group said it would begin voluntary updates on its share repurchase program to increase transparency for investors.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Alibaba repurchased 1.25 billion ordinary shares for a total of $12.5 billion, including 524 million ordinary shares repurchased in its fourth fiscal quarter.\nAlibaba\u2019s total shareholder yield, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, led its large-cap peers by reaching 6.5% during the 2023 calendar year.\nThe holding company, which made its 2014 stock market debut in New York and completed a secondary listing in Hong Kong in 2019, is also in the midst of preparations for a dual-primary listing on the two bourses slated for the end of August 2024.",

    "Document": "Alibaba Group\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue grew 7% year-over-year to RMB221.87 billion ($30.73 billion), edging ahead of forecasts as it notched wins across its core e-commerce and cloud businesses.\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31 outpaced Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimate of approximately RMB219.80 billion, while revenue for the 2024 fiscal year rose 8% year-over-year to RMB941.17 billion.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen early results from increased investment in our strategic business priorities and are confident in our business outlook,\u201d said Toby Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group.\nAlibaba\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) for the quarter decreased 5% year-over-year to RMB23.97 billion, primarily due to increased investment in its e-commerce businesses and one-time retention incentives for employees of logistics arm Cainiao. Quarterly non-GAAP net income declined 11% year-over-year to RMB24.42 billion.\nAlibaba increased its capital expenditure on Alibaba Cloud infrastructure and its Chinese and cross-border e-commerce businesses, leading to double-digit growth across key metrics including gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that our strategies are working and we are returning to growth,\u201d said Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.\nThe company also announced a $4.0 billion dividend distribution to continuously enhance shareholder return.\nAlibaba\u2019s e-commerce businesses recorded an uptick in purchasing frequency and customer retention over the quarter, even as retail growth slowed in China.\nAcross the country, total retail sales of consumer goods in March grew 3.1% year-over-year, trailing the 5.5% and 7.4% growth recorded in the January-February and December periods, respectively, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.\nDespite the broader slowdown, revenue during the latest quarter grew 4% year-on-year to RMB93.22 billion at Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG).\nTTG\u2019s adjusted EBITA shrank slightly to RMB38.5 billion compared to RMB39.04 billion in the same quarter of 2023, as the business increased strategic investment in areas including customer service, membership program benefits and technology.\n\u201cOur China and international commerce businesses realized double-digit year-over-year GMV growth through our focus on the customer experience,\u201d said Wu, who stepped into the role of Taobao and Tmall Group CEO last year.\nHe has emphasized that 2024 would be a year of strategic upgrades and significant investment into the core businesses, and it has started to bear fruit.\nOnline gross merchandise value \u2013 excluding unpaid orders \u2013 and order growth expanded by double-digits year-over-year, fueling a 5% increase in customer management revenue.\nMembership in TTG\u2019s 88VIP loyalty program increased by double digits year-over-year in the quarter to top 35 million members, as consumers were enticed by improving service and more benefits.\nTaobao has introduced more user-friendly measures including a simplified 6.18 sales structure and a website update. Likewise, Tmall announced plans to triple the scale of resources dedicated to new products.\nBetween January and March, the number of new merchants on Tmall rose 60% year-over-year, while the total transaction volume of new merchants over this time increased by 150% compared with last year.\nQuarterly revenue from the company\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group rose 3% to RMB25.60 billion, driven by the double-digit growth of its public cloud business.\nAlibaba Cloud\u2019s public cloud offerings are available online for organizations and individuals alike, and include elastic compute, database and AI products and services. The company saw triple-digit growth in AI-related revenue in the fourth quarter.\nTo attract start-ups and small businesses that will support long-term growth, Alibaba recently slashed the price of over 100 core public cloud products in the Chinese market.\nIn April, the company also extended these cost reductions to international customers, with an average price reduction of 23%.\n\u201cWe are excited by the accelerated growth of customers and cloud computing revenues related to our AI products. We will remain focused on our strategic priorities and capture future growth opportunities,\u201d said Wu.\nOver 90,000 enterprises have adopted Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen large language model (LLM) since it debuted a year ago, on top of more than 7 million downloads on open-source platforms like Github.\nAlibaba Cloud recently launched a service to help companies customize and scale generative AI models, from consolidating multiple models to optimizing underlying infrastructure resources.\nIn addition, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI-driven sustainability platform Energy Expert rolled out an open API service enabling developers to build customized sustainability applications.\nIts AI computing platform for high-performance computing tasks, PAI-Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service, became available in Singapore for the first time this year.\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) marketplaces notched a 20% increase in combined orders for the latest quarter as revenue grew 45% year-over-year to RMB27.45 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nCross-border retail platform AliExpress provides price-competitive products and efficient fulfillment under its Choice service, which accounted for around 70% of AliExpress\u2019s total orders in April 2024.\nIncreased synergies between AliExpress and Cainiao led five to ten-day delivery completion rates to double year-over-year for Choice orders over the quarter.\nCainiao, which withdrew its plan to make an initial public offering on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange in March partly to focus on supporting cross-border fulfillment services within AIDC, has also gone from strength to strength.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue from Cainiao grew 30% year-over-year to RMB24.56 billion. Cainiao\u2019s five to ten-day delivery service extended into four additional countries during the quarter, bringing the number of countries covered by the premium service to 14.\nInvestment in cross-border initiatives ramped up across the board in the fourth quarter.\nTurkish online retailer Trendyol expanded into the Gulf region and has become one of the region\u2019s most downloaded e-commerce apps. At the same time, AliExpress earmarked millions of euros for discounts and deals as part of an exclusive global sponsorship of the upcoming UEFA European Football Championship set for this summer.\nAs a result of increased investment in key markets to enhance customer experience and expand consumer base, AIDC posted a loss of RMB4.09 billion in the quarter for adjusted EBITA.\nAs part of management\u2019s commitment to delivering value to shareholders, Alibaba has announced a two-part dividend worth an aggregate $4.0 billion.\nThe Alibaba board approved an annual regular cash dividend for the most recent fiscal year and an extraordinary cash dividend comprised of proceeds from the disposition of certain financial investments.\nThe one-time extraordinary dividend will come to $0.0825 per ordinary share or $0.66 per ADS and will be paid in U.S. dollars to holders of ordinary shares and ADSs as of the close of business on June 13, 2024, Hong Kong Time and New York Time, respectively.\n\u201cWe are committed to continuing to return value to our shareholders,\u201d said Alibaba\u2019s Xu.\nEarlier this year, the group said it would begin voluntary updates on its share repurchase program to increase transparency for investors.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Alibaba repurchased 1.25 billion ordinary shares for a total of $12.5 billion, including 524 million ordinary shares repurchased in its fourth fiscal quarter.\nAlibaba\u2019s total shareholder yield, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, led its large-cap peers by reaching 6.5% during the 2023 calendar year.\nThe holding company, which made its 2014 stock market debut in New York and completed a secondary listing in Hong Kong in 2019, is also in the midst of preparations for a dual-primary listing on the two bourses slated for the end of August 2024.",

While this is a challenging environment for our type of goods, we are focused on reigniting Etsy marketplace growth and gaining market share.\"\nSecond quarter 2024 performance highlights include:\n\"We are investing in strategic growth areas including Gifting, highlighting the best of Etsy through Quality initiatives, launching a new Loyalty Program, expanding our App, and more, while also carefully managing expenses to deliver very healthy profit,\" said Rachel Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. \"In fact, second quarter adjusted EBITDA was about 28%, ahead of our guidance and up 130 bps from last year, as we gained leverage year-over-year on employee costs and cost of revenue, which was partially offset by higher level of performance marketing investments to help fuel buyer growth and frequency. The Etsy marketplace's record level of active buyers has held up quite well, and we added approximately 12 million new and reactivated buyers during the quarter.\"\n______________________________________\n1\u00a0Etsy Gifting GMS: Estimate based upon word 'gift' in the listing title, shipped with a gift message, or other signal the item was purchased as a gift.\n2\u00a0Source: Consumer Edge spend data from sampling of credit card transactions from online 'gifting' peers Zola, Zazzle, Minted, Uncommon Goods, Hallmark, and Mark and Graham.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Summary(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThe financial results of Elo7 have been included in our consolidated financial results for the prior year periods, as Elo7 was sold on August 10, 2023.

In 2024, we are focused on building buyer consideration by making it easier to 'find the best stuff' on Etsy, driving association that Etsy sellers offer great value, and making shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable. The below highlights some of our key initiatives:\nProduct Highlights:\nIn order to drive\u00a0buyer Consideration, we are making progress in our efforts to position Etsy as an indispensable partner for Gifting, with broad based investments positively impacting our performance:\nWe launched a \"Made for You\" microsite to increase consideration and help buyers get the most out of shopping on Etsy. It features our latest product improvements, including Gift Mode, the Deals Tab, the Etsy's Picks badge, and Etsy Purchase Protection.\u00a0The microsite was launched globally in June, is available in 11 languages, and has already attracted hundreds of thousands of users.\nTo help buyers 'find the best stuff on Etsy,' we invested in the following Quality initiatives:\nAligned with our efforts to make shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable, and also to drive international growth, we recently secured a new preferred shipping partnership with a third party to simplify cross-border logistics for Turkish sellers. We continued to expand Etsy Payments globally, with about 98% of our GMS now processed through our platform.\nWe worked to continue to build trust in our marketplace with a roll out of our new seller set-up fee in additional regions. This fee, meant to strengthen our new shop onboarding process, and in combination with added trust and safety enforcement - resulted in a significant decline in fraudulent onboarding, while continuing to provide ample access for creative entrepreneurs to start businesses on Etsy.\nMarketing Highlights:\nWe further developed plans to launch our new Etsy Insider Loyalty program, currently scheduled to be introduced in invitation-only beta form to targeted occasional Etsy U.S. buyers in mid-September. Etsy Insider will be buyer-fee based, offering free U.S. domestic shipping on millions of items, item discounts, first access merchandise and other benefits, with a goal to drive frequency and loyalty over time.\nWe now manage all of Etsy's paid search campaigns in-house, enabling us to reallocate the significant external costs of managing these campaigns directly into the campaigns themselves.\nTo support our U.S. sellers, we launched a targeted marketing campaign to promote the availability of a seller financing program offered via a third party partner. We've observed strong initial engagement from the campaign signaling interest and need for additional capital among our seller community.\nEtsy's Creator Collective program, which incentivizes creators and influencers to drive purchases, social conversation, and unique content for Etsy by providing affiliate links to any page on Etsy.com and boosting top posts, has reached over 260,000 participants.\nReverb\nDepop\nConsolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance\u00a0\nQ3 24 Guidance\nGMS \nWe currently estimate that Consolidated GMS will decline in the low single digit range on a year-over-year basis. \nTake Rate\nSimilar to Q2 24\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n~27%\nRegarding our full-year 2024 outlook, we reiterate that consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin should come in at least the same as the 2023 result.\nPlease note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.\nWith respect to our expectations under \"Consolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance \" and outlook for the remainder of 2024 above, reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; in particular, stock-based compensation expense, foreign exchange (gain) loss, interest and other non-operating income, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses, and other non-recurring expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\u00a0\nEtsy will host a video webcast conference call to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will be live-streamed via our Investor Relations website (investors.etsy.com) under the Events section. A copy of the earnings call presentation will also be posted to our website.\nA replay of the video webcast will be available through the same link following the conference call starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, for at least three months thereafter.\nAbout Etsy\nEtsy, Inc. operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world.

provision (benefit) for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign exchange (gain) loss; acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses; asset impairment charges;\u00a0restructuring and other exit (income) costs; and retroactive non-income tax expense. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure that presents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation, and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platforms.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income, revenue, and our other GAAP results.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and the Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 53,005\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 61,915\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 116,009\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 136,452\nExcluding:\nInterest and other non-operating income, net \n(3,947)\n(5,934)\n(9,257)\n(11,623)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n25,972\n(56,501)\n42,623\n(49,767)\nDepreciation and amortization\n27,087\n22,946\n53,933\n46,118\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n74,717\n77,281\n145,400\n145,964\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n(4,861)\n(1,852)\n(11,116)\n765\nAcquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses \n234\n289\n2,132\n578\nAsset impairment charges\n\u2014\n68,091\n\u2014\n68,091\nRestructuring and other exit (income) costs \n(76)\n\u2014\n342\n\u2014\nRetroactive non-income tax expense\u00a0 (2)\n7,244\n\u2014\n7,244\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 179,375\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 166,235\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 347,310\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 336,578\nDivided by:\nRevenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 647,806\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 628,876\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,293,760\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,269,753\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n27.7\u00a0%\n26.4\u00a0%\n26.8\u00a0%\n26.5\u00a0%\n(1)\nStock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented below is as follows:\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCost of revenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,787\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,171\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,491\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15,417\nMarketing\n5,882\n6,107\n12,319\n11,369\nProduct development\n38,441\n38,220\n72,505\n74,929\nGeneral and administrative\n21,607\n24,783\n44,085\n44,249\nStock-based compensation expense \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74,717\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 77,281\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,400\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,964\n(2)\nRetroactive non-income tax expense related to the digital services tax legislation in Canada, which was enacted on June 28, 2024 retroactive to January 1, 2022.\n\u00a0\n View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/etsy-inc-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211378.html\nSOURCE  Etsy, Inc.\n\nEmail Alerts\n\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results\n\nConsolidated results came in at the high end or ahead of guidance for key performance metrics\nBROOKLYN, N.Y., July 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, today announced results for its second quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024.\n\"We are pleased that second quarter consolidated results included sequential acceleration of Etsy marketplace year-over-year GMS, higher consolidated revenue both year-over-year and sequentially, and strong adjusted EBITDA profitability,\" said Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. Chief Executive Officer. \"Gifting is proving to be a winning theme - driving growth as a key source of differentiation for Etsy. We are making excellent progress with other bold moves and investments meant to raise consideration among buyers - to help us stand apart more than ever. While this is a challenging environment for our type of goods, we are focused on reigniting Etsy marketplace growth and gaining market share.\"\nSecond quarter 2024 performance highlights include:\n\"We are investing in strategic growth areas including Gifting, highlighting the best of Etsy through Quality initiatives, launching a new Loyalty Program, expanding our App, and more, while also carefully managing expenses to deliver very healthy profit,\" said Rachel Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. \"In fact, second quarter adjusted EBITDA was about 28%, ahead of our guidance and up 130 bps from last year, as we gained leverage year-over-year on employee costs and cost of revenue, which was partially offset by higher level of performance marketing investments to help fuel buyer growth and frequency. The Etsy marketplace's record level of active buyers has held up quite well, and we added approximately 12 million new and reactivated buyers during the quarter.\"\n______________________________________\n1\u00a0Etsy Gifting GMS: Estimate based upon word 'gift' in the listing title, shipped with a gift message, or other signal the item was purchased as a gift.\n2\u00a0Source: Consumer Edge spend data from sampling of credit card transactions from online 'gifting' peers Zola, Zazzle, Minted, Uncommon Goods, Hallmark, and Mark and Graham.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Summary(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThe financial results of Elo7 have been included in our consolidated financial results for the prior year periods, as Elo7 was sold on August 10, 2023.

In 2024, we are focused on building buyer consideration by making it easier to 'find the best stuff' on Etsy, driving association that Etsy sellers offer great value, and making shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable. The below highlights some of our key initiatives:\nProduct Highlights:\nIn order to drive\u00a0buyer Consideration, we are making progress in our efforts to position Etsy as an indispensable partner for Gifting, with broad based investments positively impacting our performance:\nWe launched a \"Made for You\" microsite to increase consideration and help buyers get the most out of shopping on Etsy. It features our latest product improvements, including Gift Mode, the Deals Tab, the Etsy's Picks badge, and Etsy Purchase Protection.\u00a0The microsite was launched globally in June, is available in 11 languages, and has already attracted hundreds of thousands of users.\nTo help buyers 'find the best stuff on Etsy,' we invested in the following Quality initiatives:\nAligned with our efforts to make shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable, and also to drive international growth, we recently secured a new preferred shipping partnership with a third party to simplify cross-border logistics for Turkish sellers. We continued to expand Etsy Payments globally, with about 98% of our GMS now processed through our platform.\nWe worked to continue to build trust in our marketplace with a roll out of our new seller set-up fee in additional regions. This fee, meant to strengthen our new shop onboarding process, and in combination with added trust and safety enforcement - resulted in a significant decline in fraudulent onboarding, while continuing to provide ample access for creative entrepreneurs to start businesses on Etsy.\nMarketing Highlights:\nWe further developed plans to launch our new Etsy Insider Loyalty program, currently scheduled to be introduced in invitation-only beta form to targeted occasional Etsy U.S. buyers in mid-September. Etsy Insider will be buyer-fee based, offering free U.S. domestic shipping on millions of items, item discounts, first access merchandise and other benefits, with a goal to drive frequency and loyalty over time.\nWe now manage all of Etsy's paid search campaigns in-house, enabling us to reallocate the significant external costs of managing these campaigns directly into the campaigns themselves.\nTo support our U.S. sellers, we launched a targeted marketing campaign to promote the availability of a seller financing program offered via a third party partner. We've observed strong initial engagement from the campaign signaling interest and need for additional capital among our seller community.\nEtsy's Creator Collective program, which incentivizes creators and influencers to drive purchases, social conversation, and unique content for Etsy by providing affiliate links to any page on Etsy.com and boosting top posts, has reached over 260,000 participants.\nReverb\nDepop\nConsolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance\u00a0\nQ3 24 Guidance\nGMS \nWe currently estimate that Consolidated GMS will decline in the low single digit range on a year-over-year basis. \nTake Rate\nSimilar to Q2 24\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n~27%\nRegarding our full-year 2024 outlook, we reiterate that consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin should come in at least the same as the 2023 result.\nPlease note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.\nWith respect to our expectations under \"Consolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance \" and outlook for the remainder of 2024 above, reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; in particular, stock-based compensation expense, foreign exchange (gain) loss, interest and other non-operating income, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses, and other non-recurring expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\u00a0\nEtsy will host a video webcast conference call to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will be live-streamed via our Investor Relations website (investors.etsy.com) under the Events section. A copy of the earnings call presentation will also be posted to our website.\nA replay of the video webcast will be available through the same link following the conference call starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, for at least three months thereafter.\nAbout Etsy\nEtsy, Inc. operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world.

These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the level of demand for our services or products sold in our marketplaces; (2) the importance to our success of the trustworthiness of our marketplaces and our ability to attract and retain active and engaged communities of buyers and sellers; (3) the fluctuation of our quarterly operating results; (4) our failure to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations; (5) any real or perceived inaccuracies in our operational metrics; (6) if we or our third-party providers are unable to protect against technology vulnerabilities, service interruptions, security breaches, or other cyber-related events; (7) our dependence on continued and unimpeded access to third-party services, platforms, and infrastructure; (8) macroeconomic events that are outside of our control; (9) operational and compliance risks related to our payments systems; (10) our ability to recruit and retain employees; (11) our ability to compete effectively; (12) enforcement of our marketplace policies; (13) our ability to enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of sellers and buyers; (14) risks related to our environmental, social, and governance activities and disclosures; (15) our efforts to expand our operations outside of the United States; (16) acquisitions that may prove unsuccessful or divert management attention; (17) failure to deal effectively with fraud; (18) compliance with evolving regulations, including in the area of privacy and data protection; and (19) litigation and regulatory matters, including intellectual property claims. These and other risks and uncertainties are more fully described in our filings with the\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the section entitled\u00a0\"Risk Factors\"\u00a0in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and subsequent reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make.

provision (benefit) for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign exchange (gain) loss; acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses; asset impairment charges;\u00a0restructuring and other exit (income) costs; and retroactive non-income tax expense. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure that presents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation, and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platforms.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income, revenue, and our other GAAP results.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and the Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 53,005\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 61,915\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 116,009\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 136,452\nExcluding:\nInterest and other non-operating income, net \n(3,947)\n(5,934)\n(9,257)\n(11,623)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n25,972\n(56,501)\n42,623\n(49,767)\nDepreciation and amortization\n27,087\n22,946\n53,933\n46,118\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n74,717\n77,281\n145,400\n145,964\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n(4,861)\n(1,852)\n(11,116)\n765\nAcquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses \n234\n289\n2,132\n578\nAsset impairment charges\n\u2014\n68,091\n\u2014\n68,091\nRestructuring and other exit (income) costs \n(76)\n\u2014\n342\n\u2014\nRetroactive non-income tax expense\u00a0 (2)\n7,244\n\u2014\n7,244\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 179,375\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 166,235\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 347,310\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 336,578\nDivided by:\nRevenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 647,806\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 628,876\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,293,760\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,269,753\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n27.7\u00a0%\n26.4\u00a0%\n26.8\u00a0%\n26.5\u00a0%\n(1)\nStock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented below is as follows:\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCost of revenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,787\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,171\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,491\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15,417\nMarketing\n5,882\n6,107\n12,319\n11,369\nProduct development\n38,441\n38,220\n72,505\n74,929\nGeneral and administrative\n21,607\n24,783\n44,085\n44,249\nStock-based compensation expense \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74,717\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 77,281\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,400\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,964\n(2)\nRetroactive non-income tax expense related to the digital services tax legislation in Canada, which was enacted on June 28, 2024 retroactive to January 1, 2022.\n\u00a0\n View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/etsy-inc-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211378.html\nSOURCE  Etsy, Inc.\n\nEmail Alerts\n\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results\n\nConsolidated results came in at the high end or ahead of guidance for key performance metrics\nBROOKLYN, N.Y., July 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, today announced results for its second quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024.\n\"We are pleased that second quarter consolidated results included sequential acceleration of Etsy marketplace year-over-year GMS, higher consolidated revenue both year-over-year and sequentially, and strong adjusted EBITDA profitability,\" said Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. Chief Executive Officer. \"Gifting is proving to be a winning theme - driving growth as a key source of differentiation for Etsy. We are making excellent progress with other bold moves and investments meant to raise consideration among buyers - to help us stand apart more than ever. While this is a challenging environment for our type of goods, we are focused on reigniting Etsy marketplace growth and gaining market share.\"\nSecond quarter 2024 performance highlights include:\n\"We are investing in strategic growth areas including Gifting, highlighting the best of Etsy through Quality initiatives, launching a new Loyalty Program, expanding our App, and more, while also carefully managing expenses to deliver very healthy profit,\" said Rachel Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. \"In fact, second quarter adjusted EBITDA was about 28%, ahead of our guidance and up 130 bps from last year, as we gained leverage year-over-year on employee costs and cost of revenue, which was partially offset by higher level of performance marketing investments to help fuel buyer growth and frequency. The Etsy marketplace's record level of active buyers has held up quite well, and we added approximately 12 million new and reactivated buyers during the quarter.\"\n______________________________________\n1\u00a0Etsy Gifting GMS: Estimate based upon word 'gift' in the listing title, shipped with a gift message, or other signal the item was purchased as a gift.\n2\u00a0Source: Consumer Edge spend data from sampling of credit card transactions from online 'gifting' peers Zola, Zazzle, Minted, Uncommon Goods, Hallmark, and Mark and Graham.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Summary(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThe financial results of Elo7 have been included in our consolidated financial results for the prior year periods, as Elo7 was sold on August 10, 2023.

In 2024, we are focused on building buyer consideration by making it easier to 'find the best stuff' on Etsy, driving association that Etsy sellers offer great value, and making shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable. The below highlights some of our key initiatives:\nProduct Highlights:\nIn order to drive\u00a0buyer Consideration, we are making progress in our efforts to position Etsy as an indispensable partner for Gifting, with broad based investments positively impacting our performance:\nWe launched a \"Made for You\" microsite to increase consideration and help buyers get the most out of shopping on Etsy. It features our latest product improvements, including Gift Mode, the Deals Tab, the Etsy's Picks badge, and Etsy Purchase Protection.\u00a0The microsite was launched globally in June, is available in 11 languages, and has already attracted hundreds of thousands of users.\nTo help buyers 'find the best stuff on Etsy,' we invested in the following Quality initiatives:\nAligned with our efforts to make shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable, and also to drive international growth, we recently secured a new preferred shipping partnership with a third party to simplify cross-border logistics for Turkish sellers. We continued to expand Etsy Payments globally, with about 98% of our GMS now processed through our platform.\nWe worked to continue to build trust in our marketplace with a roll out of our new seller set-up fee in additional regions. This fee, meant to strengthen our new shop onboarding process, and in combination with added trust and safety enforcement - resulted in a significant decline in fraudulent onboarding, while continuing to provide ample access for creative entrepreneurs to start businesses on Etsy.\nMarketing Highlights:\nWe further developed plans to launch our new Etsy Insider Loyalty program, currently scheduled to be introduced in invitation-only beta form to targeted occasional Etsy U.S. buyers in mid-September. Etsy Insider will be buyer-fee based, offering free U.S. domestic shipping on millions of items, item discounts, first access merchandise and other benefits, with a goal to drive frequency and loyalty over time.\nWe now manage all of Etsy's paid search campaigns in-house, enabling us to reallocate the significant external costs of managing these campaigns directly into the campaigns themselves.\nTo support our U.S. sellers, we launched a targeted marketing campaign to promote the availability of a seller financing program offered via a third party partner. We've observed strong initial engagement from the campaign signaling interest and need for additional capital among our seller community.\nEtsy's Creator Collective program, which incentivizes creators and influencers to drive purchases, social conversation, and unique content for Etsy by providing affiliate links to any page on Etsy.com and boosting top posts, has reached over 260,000 participants.\nReverb\nDepop\nConsolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance\u00a0\nQ3 24 Guidance\nGMS \nWe currently estimate that Consolidated GMS will decline in the low single digit range on a year-over-year basis. \nTake Rate\nSimilar to Q2 24\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n~27%\nRegarding our full-year 2024 outlook, we reiterate that consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin should come in at least the same as the 2023 result.\nPlease note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.\nWith respect to our expectations under \"Consolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance \" and outlook for the remainder of 2024 above, reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; in particular, stock-based compensation expense, foreign exchange (gain) loss, interest and other non-operating income, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses, and other non-recurring expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\u00a0\nEtsy will host a video webcast conference call to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will be live-streamed via our Investor Relations website (investors.etsy.com) under the Events section. A copy of the earnings call presentation will also be posted to our website.\nA replay of the video webcast will be available through the same link following the conference call starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, for at least three months thereafter.\nAbout Etsy\nEtsy, Inc. operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world.

provision (benefit) for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign exchange (gain) loss; acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses; asset impairment charges;\u00a0restructuring and other exit (income) costs; and retroactive non-income tax expense. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure that presents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation, and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platforms.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income, revenue, and our other GAAP results.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and the Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 53,005\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 61,915\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 116,009\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 136,452\nExcluding:\nInterest and other non-operating income, net \n(3,947)\n(5,934)\n(9,257)\n(11,623)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n25,972\n(56,501)\n42,623\n(49,767)\nDepreciation and amortization\n27,087\n22,946\n53,933\n46,118\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n74,717\n77,281\n145,400\n145,964\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n(4,861)\n(1,852)\n(11,116)\n765\nAcquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses \n234\n289\n2,132\n578\nAsset impairment charges\n\u2014\n68,091\n\u2014\n68,091\nRestructuring and other exit (income) costs \n(76)\n\u2014\n342\n\u2014\nRetroactive non-income tax expense\u00a0 (2)\n7,244\n\u2014\n7,244\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 179,375\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 166,235\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 347,310\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 336,578\nDivided by:\nRevenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 647,806\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 628,876\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,293,760\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,269,753\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n27.7\u00a0%\n26.4\u00a0%\n26.8\u00a0%\n26.5\u00a0%\n(1)\nStock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented below is as follows:\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCost of revenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,787\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,171\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,491\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15,417\nMarketing\n5,882\n6,107\n12,319\n11,369\nProduct development\n38,441\n38,220\n72,505\n74,929\nGeneral and administrative\n21,607\n24,783\n44,085\n44,249\nStock-based compensation expense \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74,717\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 77,281\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,400\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,964\n(2)\nRetroactive non-income tax expense related to the digital services tax legislation in Canada, which was enacted on June 28, 2024 retroactive to January 1, 2022.\n\u00a0\n View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/etsy-inc-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211378.html\nSOURCE  Etsy, Inc.\n\nEmail Alerts\n\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

But as most small business owners know, there are times where you need to stop and make sure that your business is bringing in the revenue it should be.\nOur research indicates that figuring out the best trucking rates per mile is the key to making sure that your business remains profitable, but it can also be a complex process as rates are constantly changing.\nBefore getting into the details on trucking rates per mile 2024, it\u2019s important to understand what goes into determining freight truck rates.\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll find out what current trucking rates per mile are and get a refresher on the industry terms to remember as you navigate truck rates.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nHow to calculate trucking  freight rates\nThe trucking rates can be calculated by multiplying your trucking rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points.\nTotal trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles)\nLike other trades jobs, there is a lot that goes into determining the best trucking rate per mile for your business.\nOur findings show that not only do you have to constantly monitor your fuel spend as well as supply and demand, but you also have to take into account your fixed costs.\nBut let\u2019s start with the basics for truck rates per mile.\nA truck freight rate is a price a shipper or broker will pay you, the carrier, to haul a load. The concept is simple, but our research indicates that trucking rates per mile can vary significantly depending on the time of year and current fuel prices.\nWhich can make knowing the national average trucking cost per mile feel like a black box.\nTrucking freight rates are calculated on a per mile basis. Therefore, the most important number when it comes to calculating truck rates is the number of miles between your starting point and the destination.\nBased on our observations, having the average rate per mile for trucking and accurate information about trucking freight rates is essential to properly pricing trips and negotiating rates with your customers.\nBe aware, however, that calculating the overall freight rate depends on various other factors. Below, you\u2019ll find what you need to consider when calculating trucking rates.\nFactor #1: Distance of travel\nImage credit: Nelson Gono via Unsplash\nWhether you\u2019re transporting locally or looking at over the road trucking rates, the distance between destinations is an important part of determining trucking rates per mile.\nYou want to ensure that you have the right mileage from the beginning to avoid any surprises along the way and get the correct per mile trucking rates.\nDouble-check that your driver will not be required to make any long detours because of road closures. Otherwise, you risk job profitability, timing, and changes to the rate per mile for truck drivers.\nFactor #2: The weight of the shipment\nAfter the distance, our findings show that the weight of the shipment is one of the most significant factors for the cost of trucking per mile. It is important to manage the overall weight load for your fleet to control costs and determine your per mile rate for trucking.\nTo be successful at this, you\u2019ll need to consider variables like heavy haul rates per mile, FTL trucking rates, number of passengers, etc.\nOtherwise, you stand to incorrectly answer \u201cWhat is the average freight cost per mile?\u201d.\nWhen it comes to your average per mile rate for freight, it\u2019s best to be on the safe side and start with higher rates per mile for trucking to allow your customer to negotiate while still ensuring revenue for your business.\nWith this approach, your average haulage cost per mile is sure to bring a profit to your business.\nFactor #3: Shipment density\nThe shipment density is another factor that will determine how much room a shipment will take up in your truck and, in turn, your trucking per mile rates.\nDrawing from our experience, once you know the weight of the shipment, calculating the shipment density is simple. All you have to do is divide the cargo weight by its cubic feet.\nFactor #4: Freight classification\nA question that often goes unanswered is \u201cWhat is the average freight rate per mile?\u201d.\nAnd the question makes sense based on our observations given the number of important industry standards to keep up with for freight classification.\nThe National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) has defined 18 classes of shipments that affect freight rates per mile.\nFreight classification is determined by factors such as:\nHaving a thorough knowledge of how to use these factors to calculate trucking rates per mile will ensure that your business remains competitive and profitable.\nOur findings show that most trucking companies charge customers per mile based on factors like:\nYou need to strike a good balance when setting your rates \u2013 setting a low rate may cause you to lose money, while setting a high rate may turn customers away toward cheaper companies.\nA good rule of thumb to stay competitive rate-wise is to keep an eye on both national and local trucking rates. And based on our observations, providing a fair rate with excellent service is the key to getting (and retaining) more customers.\nAt the time of writing, the national average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile. However, this is just a national average, which means your area may have higher or lower rates.\nTo set a fair price for your flatbed truck services, you need to consider things like:\nThrough our practical knowledge, setting a fair per-mile rate means you can pay truckers a fair wage, keep the clients happy, and still a profit.\nAlthough these are the main takeaways on how to calculate trucking rates, you want to ensure that you have the basic industry knowledge to determine other factors that may influence your truck rates.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some key trucking terms, beyond freight trucking rates, to set you up for success.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nThe terms in trucking you need to know\nKeeping up to date with all of the basic trucking terms is an important factor in knowing how to calculate trucking rates and freight cost per mile.\nFirst things first, there are several types of freight trucks, and they are each ideal to haul different cargo. Your freight type will determine your trucking rates per mile as freight costs per mile steeply influence your fuel spend.\nDifferent types of freight trucks include:\nHere are some other industry terms that play a factor in the national trucking rate per mile and that will help you understand what the going rate for freight per mile is.\nConsignor\nThe consignor is the party that is shipping the product you\u2019re transporting. They are also known as the seller and are your customer.\nThe consignor can be:\nThe ownership of the products stays with the consignor until the consignee pays them in full. Still, our investigation demonstrated that that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the liability stays with them.\nConsignee\nA consignee is a recipient of the products being shipped. You can think of them as the buyer, and they can be an individual or a company.\nThe consignee must be physically present to accept the shipment from the consignor unless specifically stated otherwise in the bill of lading.\nCarrier\nImage credit: Quintin Gellar via Pexels\nYour role in the shipping process will be that of the carrier. The carrier is the party in charge of delivering the products to their destination.\nAs a carrier, you\u2019re responsible for receiving the bill of lading and safely transporting items to the consignee.\nBill of lading (BOL)\nThe consignor sends the goods to you, the freight carrier, to ship them to the consignee. However, the ownership of the freight doesn\u2019t legally change until the recipient of the goods signs the bill of lading (BOL).\nA BOL is a document required in the shipping process that involves all parties: the consignor, consignee, and carrier. The consignor and consignee each get a copy of the BOL, and then there is usually a third copy for the bank.\nThe BOL includes relevant details necessary to ship the product and invoice the transaction correctly once it is completed.\nIt includes the following information:\nFree on board point (FOB)\nFree on board (FOB), also known as freight on board, is a term used to indicate whether the buyer or the seller is liable for goods that are lost, damaged, or destroyed during shipping.\nThe FOB shipping point indicates that the title and responsibility of goods transfer from the seller to the buyer when the goods are placed on your delivery vehicle.\nOn the other hand, a FOB destination means that the seller is responsible for the goods until the goods are delivered to the buyer.\nLoss and damage\nAs a carrier, you may have to deal with loss or damage claims from time to time.\nA damage claim involves visible damage to either the goods or the storage container that the goods are in. The damage should be noted on the bill of lading or another delivery document.\nA loss claim is when a shipment is not delivered or when it shows that it was delivered, but the recipient hasn\u2019t received it. This can be due to typography errors in the bill of lading causing the shipment to go to the wrong address.\nFull truckload shipping (FTL)\nFull truckload shipping (FTL) applies to a shipment that takes up an entire trailer. This is a key price variable as it affects the cost of freight per mile.\nWhen it comes to FTL freight rates factors, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s the smallest truck in your fleet or the largest as FTL applies as long as you use up your entire space. Typically, FTL freight will exceed 15,000 pounds.\nThe full truck load cost per mile typically costs a higher rate per mile since your truck is at full capacity.\nLess than truckload (LTL)\nA less than truckload shipment (LTL) doesn\u2019t take up an entire trailer but may need to move between vehicles during the shipping process. For this reason, LTL rates per mile aren\u2019t always standard across jobs and will affect your average LTL cost per mile.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll need to charge your customers a different rate than the average truckload rate per mile if you\u2019re at less than a truckload.\nTrucking rates per mile for LTL will vary depending on how far your company will be taking the shipment.\nLoad rates for trucks\nLoad rates or freight rates are what you charge for a truck to deliver cargo from one place to another.\nLoad rates are typically paid per mile and can be influenced by factors such as:\nAdditional services like warehouse storage, loading and unloading, and automotive insurance may be included in calculating a customer\u2019s load rates.\nOur findings show that load rates also vary depending on the type of cargo being carried because different cargo may need different types of trucks to transport.\nDrayage\nDrayage is a term that involves shipping goods at a short distance via ground freight. Basically, it is the process of moving a large container to your truck.\nBased on our firsthand experience, this may be an extra cost that you have to consider when giving your customer an estimate of the total cost of your services.\nPallets\nPallets are portable platforms used to package items for freight shipping. Pallets come in different sizes, but the most common size that you\u2019ll find is the standard 40 x 48 size to ship items.\nPallets not only make loading and unloading items easier, but they also allow you to maximize space in your truck. This may reduce your total cost and allow you to provide more competitive trucking rates per mile.\nStop keeping unit (SKU)\nAn SKU (Stock keeping unit) is a service identification code. They\u2019re usually displayed alphanumerically or as a barcode.\nSKUs help track products in inventory as they contain all factors required to identify an item, such as:\nHundredweight (CWT)\nA hundredweight, also known as a CWT, is a unit of measurement. In North America, a hundredweight refers to 100 pounds, whereas the British consider a hundredweight to be 112 pounds.\nIn the past, packages that take up less than an entire truckload were measured by CWTs, but it is not common to measure packages by CWT today. Measuring by pounds or kilograms is now the standard.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nIn order to continue to offer competitive trucking rates per mile, you need to know how much do trucking companies charge per mile. Cost per mile is influenced by factors such as:\nFinancing is also a cost that may influence the cost per mile. The cost of financing trucks and trailers ranges from 0% to 30% of revenue.\nAs of July 2021, trucking rates per mile remain steady. Here are the current rates for the most popular freight truck types:\nFuel prices have been steadily increasing over the past year and are a huge variable in knowing how to calculate transportation rates.\nThe national diesel price was sitting at $3.34 per gallon, with a $0.05 increase from June 2021 to July 2021. However, in 2024 prices have increased greatly with high rates of fluctuation when it comes to price and supply availability.\nAverage rate per mile for owner-operators\nIn contrast to company drivers, owner-operators are truckers who own or lease their own trucks. These people usually work with a trucking company to get back-office support and find trucking jobs.\nOwner-operators generally earn about 70 to 80 percent of the loads they take. For example, if flatbed truck transport is $3.14 per mile, the owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. If they\u2019re out on the road often, they may earn up to $156,000 annually.\nWhere does the rest of your per-mile rate go? The remaining 20 to 30 percent goes to your trucking company. An owner-operator at a trucking company benefits from access to cargo jobs, in-house mechanics, and gas station location optimization.\nBeing an owner-operator is a great way to earn more money, but it also means you will be dealing with the stress and finances largely on your own.\nFor example, you\u2019ll have to shoulder truck maintenance, health insurance, and other business expenses.\nIf you\u2019re not prepared to take on the added risk and costs, becoming a company trucker is always viable.\nTrucking rates per mile 2024 FAQs:\nHere are the top questions truckers have in 2024:\nDo trucking companies pay for empty miles?\nEmpty miles, also known as non-revenue or deadhead miles, are miles garnered by the truck when it isn\u2019t earning any revenue.\nBased on our observations, this happens when there\u2019s a load to the destination but no load back. Empty miles range from 33 \u2013 40% of total miles driven, making them very wasteful for your trucking business.\nTo avoid empty miles, try to minimize any unnecessary movement of goods and improve your scheduling so that your trucks are carrying a load as often as possible.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid an empty mile, it\u2019s best to add a portion of it to your rate per mile trucking costs.\nWhat is a good rate per mile for trucking companies to charge?\nAfter putting it to the test, it is difficult to determine an average rate for trucking rates per mile, but if you keep up with industry news, you\u2019ll always have a good idea of average trucking rates.\nTo answer your question on what is the going rate per mile for trucking \u2014 current trucking rates per mile 2024 averages are:\nKeep in mind that these are just average per mile trucking rates, and your business may profit from a different rate. Based on our observations, providing the lowest rates may not be enough to bring your revenue, but a rate that\u2019s too high may price you out of the competition.\nThe same goes for how much you offer your drivers. As per our expertise, you need to know what is the average rate per mile for truck drivers in your area so you can be fair as well as competitive when it comes to wages.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nThe average going rates for trucking per mile are:\nMany things influence trucking freight rates. Some key factors include:\nWhy are trucking rates so low?\nOur findings show that recent trucking rates are low because of a larger supply compared to the available demand.\nWhen the pandemic began, people needed more things shipped, and the for-hire trucking market soared. Trucking companies started large recruiting drives, and many people decided to start trucking businesses of their own.\nBut now that the volume of shipments is falling to pre-pandemic levels, there are simply too many truckers and not enough demand for shipments by truck. As the laws of supply and demand dictate, an abundance of supply means that prices are going to fall.\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s thrown a wrench in the trucking industry. Recent global developments, such as the war in Ukraine raising fuel prices and a COVID resurgence in China\u2019s export centers causing commodity prices to rise, have made it harder for truckers to make a profit.\nThat said, the decreased demand for consumer goods doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad for truckers. While consumer goods shipments are down, 70-80% of freight consists of manufactured goods, and manufacturing companies are still willing to pay for truck deliveries.\nHow much do owner-operators make per mile?\nOwner-operators generally make 70 to 80% of their load per mile.\nIf we take flatbed rates as an example, a flatbed truck owner-operator stands to make up to $2.51 per mile out of the $3.14 per mile average rate.\nThe rest of the money goes to the trucking company to pay for benefits such as:\nThis is in contrast to company drivers, who may only get 38 to 52 cents per mile with the same load. However, the larger cut that owner-operators get comes with extra risks.\nAlthough they get benefits from their trucking company, owner-operators are still independent contractors who need to do everything themselves.\nWhile owner-operators stand to gain more money, they also need to set aside more cash for life and automotive insurance, fuel and maintenance, and taxes.\nBecause of this, owner-operators are more likely to be experienced truckers. Typically, those who have worked as company drivers for several years want more freedom and the chance to make their own decisions.\nIf you\u2019re a new trucker or are simply averse to taking more risks and responsibilities, you can become a company driver first to gain more experience and confidence.\nHow much does a freight broker charge per load?\nFreight brokers usually charge around 25-35% of the load.\nA freight broker is a middleman between a shipper and the carrier. They take the shipment from the customer and contact a carrier fleet to take the shipment to its destination.\nShippers like working with freight brokers because the broker deals with everything related to the carriers, becoming the single point of contact for updates. On the other side, carriers also like working with freight brokers because they can optimize routes and give the truckers multiple shipments to reduce deadhead miles.\nWhy trucking rates are important\nYour number one goal is to have a profitable trucking business, and keeping up with average trucking rates per mile is the best way to ensure that your business continues to grow.

    "Summarized_Document": "Freight rates: Trucking rates per mile 2024\n\nIf you own a trucking business, ensuring profitability is crucial. Determining the best trucking rates per mile is key, but it can be complex due to constantly changing rates. This guide provides insights into current trucking rates per mile and essential industry terms.\n\nHow to calculate trucking freight rates\n\nTrucking rates are calculated by multiplying the rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points. The total trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles). Factors influencing trucking rates include distance, weight of the shipment, shipment density, and freight classification.\n\nKey factors in calculating trucking rates:\n\n1. Distance of travel: Ensure accurate mileage to avoid surprises and maintain profitability.\n2. Weight of the shipment: Manage overall weight load to control costs.\n3. Shipment density: Calculate by dividing cargo weight by its cubic feet.\n4. Freight classification: The NMFTA defines 18 classes of shipments affecting rates.\n\nTrucking companies charge customers per mile based on these factors. National average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile, but rates vary by area. Setting a fair per-mile rate ensures fair wages for truckers, happy clients, and profitability.\n\nIndustry terms to know:\n\n- Consignor: The party shipping the product.\n- Consignee: The recipient of the products.\n- Carrier: The party delivering the products.\n- Bill of lading (BOL): A document required in the shipping process.\n- Free on board point (FOB): Indicates liability for goods during shipping.\n- Loss and damage: Claims for visible damage or undelivered shipments.\n- Full truckload shipping (FTL): A shipment that takes up an entire trailer.\n- Less than truckload (LTL): A shipment that doesn't take up an entire trailer.\n- Load rates: Charges for delivering cargo, influenced by various factors.\n- Drayage: Shipping goods a short distance via ground freight.\n- Pallets: Portable platforms for packaging items for freight shipping.\n- Stop keeping unit (SKU): A service identification code for tracking products.\n- Hundredweight (CWT): A unit of measurement (100 pounds in North America).\n\nCurrent trucking rates per mile (2024 averages):\n\n- Flatbed: $3.14 per mile\n- Reefer: $3.19 per mile\n- Dry van: $2.50 per mile\n\nOwner-operators generally earn 70-80% of the load per mile. For example, with flatbed rates at $3.14 per mile, an owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. The remaining 20-30% goes to the trucking company for benefits like access to cargo jobs and in-house mechanics.\n\nTrucking rates are influenced by factors such as fuel prices, supply and demand, and global developments. Keeping up with industry trends and average rates ensures competitive pricing and profitability for your trucking business.",

But as most small business owners know, there are times where you need to stop and make sure that your business is bringing in the revenue it should be.\nOur research indicates that figuring out the best trucking rates per mile is the key to making sure that your business remains profitable, but it can also be a complex process as rates are constantly changing.\nBefore getting into the details on trucking rates per mile 2024, it\u2019s important to understand what goes into determining freight truck rates.\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll find out what current trucking rates per mile are and get a refresher on the industry terms to remember as you navigate truck rates.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nHow to calculate trucking  freight rates\nThe trucking rates can be calculated by multiplying your trucking rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points.\nTotal trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles)\nLike other trades jobs, there is a lot that goes into determining the best trucking rate per mile for your business.\nOur findings show that not only do you have to constantly monitor your fuel spend as well as supply and demand, but you also have to take into account your fixed costs.\nBut let\u2019s start with the basics for truck rates per mile.\nA truck freight rate is a price a shipper or broker will pay you, the carrier, to haul a load. The concept is simple, but our research indicates that trucking rates per mile can vary significantly depending on the time of year and current fuel prices.\nWhich can make knowing the national average trucking cost per mile feel like a black box.\nTrucking freight rates are calculated on a per mile basis. Therefore, the most important number when it comes to calculating truck rates is the number of miles between your starting point and the destination.\nBased on our observations, having the average rate per mile for trucking and accurate information about trucking freight rates is essential to properly pricing trips and negotiating rates with your customers.\nBe aware, however, that calculating the overall freight rate depends on various other factors. Below, you\u2019ll find what you need to consider when calculating trucking rates.\nFactor #1: Distance of travel\nImage credit: Nelson Gono via Unsplash\nWhether you\u2019re transporting locally or looking at over the road trucking rates, the distance between destinations is an important part of determining trucking rates per mile.\nYou want to ensure that you have the right mileage from the beginning to avoid any surprises along the way and get the correct per mile trucking rates.\nDouble-check that your driver will not be required to make any long detours because of road closures. Otherwise, you risk job profitability, timing, and changes to the rate per mile for truck drivers.\nFactor #2: The weight of the shipment\nAfter the distance, our findings show that the weight of the shipment is one of the most significant factors for the cost of trucking per mile. It is important to manage the overall weight load for your fleet to control costs and determine your per mile rate for trucking.\nTo be successful at this, you\u2019ll need to consider variables like heavy haul rates per mile, FTL trucking rates, number of passengers, etc.\nOtherwise, you stand to incorrectly answer \u201cWhat is the average freight cost per mile?\u201d.\nWhen it comes to your average per mile rate for freight, it\u2019s best to be on the safe side and start with higher rates per mile for trucking to allow your customer to negotiate while still ensuring revenue for your business.\nWith this approach, your average haulage cost per mile is sure to bring a profit to your business.\nFactor #3: Shipment density\nThe shipment density is another factor that will determine how much room a shipment will take up in your truck and, in turn, your trucking per mile rates.\nDrawing from our experience, once you know the weight of the shipment, calculating the shipment density is simple. All you have to do is divide the cargo weight by its cubic feet.\nFactor #4: Freight classification\nA question that often goes unanswered is \u201cWhat is the average freight rate per mile?\u201d.\nAnd the question makes sense based on our observations given the number of important industry standards to keep up with for freight classification.\nThe National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) has defined 18 classes of shipments that affect freight rates per mile.\nFreight classification is determined by factors such as:\nHaving a thorough knowledge of how to use these factors to calculate trucking rates per mile will ensure that your business remains competitive and profitable.\nOur findings show that most trucking companies charge customers per mile based on factors like:\nYou need to strike a good balance when setting your rates \u2013 setting a low rate may cause you to lose money, while setting a high rate may turn customers away toward cheaper companies.\nA good rule of thumb to stay competitive rate-wise is to keep an eye on both national and local trucking rates. And based on our observations, providing a fair rate with excellent service is the key to getting (and retaining) more customers.\nAt the time of writing, the national average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile. However, this is just a national average, which means your area may have higher or lower rates.\nTo set a fair price for your flatbed truck services, you need to consider things like:\nThrough our practical knowledge, setting a fair per-mile rate means you can pay truckers a fair wage, keep the clients happy, and still a profit.\nAlthough these are the main takeaways on how to calculate trucking rates, you want to ensure that you have the basic industry knowledge to determine other factors that may influence your truck rates.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some key trucking terms, beyond freight trucking rates, to set you up for success.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nThe terms in trucking you need to know\nKeeping up to date with all of the basic trucking terms is an important factor in knowing how to calculate trucking rates and freight cost per mile.\nFirst things first, there are several types of freight trucks, and they are each ideal to haul different cargo. Your freight type will determine your trucking rates per mile as freight costs per mile steeply influence your fuel spend.\nDifferent types of freight trucks include:\nHere are some other industry terms that play a factor in the national trucking rate per mile and that will help you understand what the going rate for freight per mile is.\nConsignor\nThe consignor is the party that is shipping the product you\u2019re transporting. They are also known as the seller and are your customer.\nThe consignor can be:\nThe ownership of the products stays with the consignor until the consignee pays them in full. Still, our investigation demonstrated that that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the liability stays with them.\nConsignee\nA consignee is a recipient of the products being shipped. You can think of them as the buyer, and they can be an individual or a company.\nThe consignee must be physically present to accept the shipment from the consignor unless specifically stated otherwise in the bill of lading.\nCarrier\nImage credit: Quintin Gellar via Pexels\nYour role in the shipping process will be that of the carrier. The carrier is the party in charge of delivering the products to their destination.\nAs a carrier, you\u2019re responsible for receiving the bill of lading and safely transporting items to the consignee.\nBill of lading (BOL)\nThe consignor sends the goods to you, the freight carrier, to ship them to the consignee. However, the ownership of the freight doesn\u2019t legally change until the recipient of the goods signs the bill of lading (BOL).\nA BOL is a document required in the shipping process that involves all parties: the consignor, consignee, and carrier. The consignor and consignee each get a copy of the BOL, and then there is usually a third copy for the bank.\nThe BOL includes relevant details necessary to ship the product and invoice the transaction correctly once it is completed.\nIt includes the following information:\nFree on board point (FOB)\nFree on board (FOB), also known as freight on board, is a term used to indicate whether the buyer or the seller is liable for goods that are lost, damaged, or destroyed during shipping.\nThe FOB shipping point indicates that the title and responsibility of goods transfer from the seller to the buyer when the goods are placed on your delivery vehicle.\nOn the other hand, a FOB destination means that the seller is responsible for the goods until the goods are delivered to the buyer.\nLoss and damage\nAs a carrier, you may have to deal with loss or damage claims from time to time.\nA damage claim involves visible damage to either the goods or the storage container that the goods are in. The damage should be noted on the bill of lading or another delivery document.\nA loss claim is when a shipment is not delivered or when it shows that it was delivered, but the recipient hasn\u2019t received it. This can be due to typography errors in the bill of lading causing the shipment to go to the wrong address.\nFull truckload shipping (FTL)\nFull truckload shipping (FTL) applies to a shipment that takes up an entire trailer. This is a key price variable as it affects the cost of freight per mile.\nWhen it comes to FTL freight rates factors, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s the smallest truck in your fleet or the largest as FTL applies as long as you use up your entire space. Typically, FTL freight will exceed 15,000 pounds.\nThe full truck load cost per mile typically costs a higher rate per mile since your truck is at full capacity.\nLess than truckload (LTL)\nA less than truckload shipment (LTL) doesn\u2019t take up an entire trailer but may need to move between vehicles during the shipping process. For this reason, LTL rates per mile aren\u2019t always standard across jobs and will affect your average LTL cost per mile.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll need to charge your customers a different rate than the average truckload rate per mile if you\u2019re at less than a truckload.\nTrucking rates per mile for LTL will vary depending on how far your company will be taking the shipment.\nLoad rates for trucks\nLoad rates or freight rates are what you charge for a truck to deliver cargo from one place to another.\nLoad rates are typically paid per mile and can be influenced by factors such as:\nAdditional services like warehouse storage, loading and unloading, and automotive insurance may be included in calculating a customer\u2019s load rates.\nOur findings show that load rates also vary depending on the type of cargo being carried because different cargo may need different types of trucks to transport.\nDrayage\nDrayage is a term that involves shipping goods at a short distance via ground freight. Basically, it is the process of moving a large container to your truck.\nBased on our firsthand experience, this may be an extra cost that you have to consider when giving your customer an estimate of the total cost of your services.\nPallets\nPallets are portable platforms used to package items for freight shipping. Pallets come in different sizes, but the most common size that you\u2019ll find is the standard 40 x 48 size to ship items.\nPallets not only make loading and unloading items easier, but they also allow you to maximize space in your truck. This may reduce your total cost and allow you to provide more competitive trucking rates per mile.\nStop keeping unit (SKU)\nAn SKU (Stock keeping unit) is a service identification code. They\u2019re usually displayed alphanumerically or as a barcode.\nSKUs help track products in inventory as they contain all factors required to identify an item, such as:\nHundredweight (CWT)\nA hundredweight, also known as a CWT, is a unit of measurement. In North America, a hundredweight refers to 100 pounds, whereas the British consider a hundredweight to be 112 pounds.\nIn the past, packages that take up less than an entire truckload were measured by CWTs, but it is not common to measure packages by CWT today. Measuring by pounds or kilograms is now the standard.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nIn order to continue to offer competitive trucking rates per mile, you need to know how much do trucking companies charge per mile. Cost per mile is influenced by factors such as:\nFinancing is also a cost that may influence the cost per mile. The cost of financing trucks and trailers ranges from 0% to 30% of revenue.\nAs of July 2021, trucking rates per mile remain steady. Here are the current rates for the most popular freight truck types:\nFuel prices have been steadily increasing over the past year and are a huge variable in knowing how to calculate transportation rates.\nThe national diesel price was sitting at $3.34 per gallon, with a $0.05 increase from June 2021 to July 2021. However, in 2024 prices have increased greatly with high rates of fluctuation when it comes to price and supply availability.\nAverage rate per mile for owner-operators\nIn contrast to company drivers, owner-operators are truckers who own or lease their own trucks. These people usually work with a trucking company to get back-office support and find trucking jobs.\nOwner-operators generally earn about 70 to 80 percent of the loads they take. For example, if flatbed truck transport is $3.14 per mile, the owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. If they\u2019re out on the road often, they may earn up to $156,000 annually.\nWhere does the rest of your per-mile rate go? The remaining 20 to 30 percent goes to your trucking company. An owner-operator at a trucking company benefits from access to cargo jobs, in-house mechanics, and gas station location optimization.\nBeing an owner-operator is a great way to earn more money, but it also means you will be dealing with the stress and finances largely on your own.\nFor example, you\u2019ll have to shoulder truck maintenance, health insurance, and other business expenses.\nIf you\u2019re not prepared to take on the added risk and costs, becoming a company trucker is always viable.\nTrucking rates per mile 2024 FAQs:\nHere are the top questions truckers have in 2024:\nDo trucking companies pay for empty miles?\nEmpty miles, also known as non-revenue or deadhead miles, are miles garnered by the truck when it isn\u2019t earning any revenue.\nBased on our observations, this happens when there\u2019s a load to the destination but no load back. Empty miles range from 33 \u2013 40% of total miles driven, making them very wasteful for your trucking business.\nTo avoid empty miles, try to minimize any unnecessary movement of goods and improve your scheduling so that your trucks are carrying a load as often as possible.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid an empty mile, it\u2019s best to add a portion of it to your rate per mile trucking costs.\nWhat is a good rate per mile for trucking companies to charge?\nAfter putting it to the test, it is difficult to determine an average rate for trucking rates per mile, but if you keep up with industry news, you\u2019ll always have a good idea of average trucking rates.\nTo answer your question on what is the going rate per mile for trucking \u2014 current trucking rates per mile 2024 averages are:\nKeep in mind that these are just average per mile trucking rates, and your business may profit from a different rate. Based on our observations, providing the lowest rates may not be enough to bring your revenue, but a rate that\u2019s too high may price you out of the competition.\nThe same goes for how much you offer your drivers. As per our expertise, you need to know what is the average rate per mile for truck drivers in your area so you can be fair as well as competitive when it comes to wages.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nThe average going rates for trucking per mile are:\nMany things influence trucking freight rates. Some key factors include:\nWhy are trucking rates so low?\nOur findings show that recent trucking rates are low because of a larger supply compared to the available demand.\nWhen the pandemic began, people needed more things shipped, and the for-hire trucking market soared. Trucking companies started large recruiting drives, and many people decided to start trucking businesses of their own.\nBut now that the volume of shipments is falling to pre-pandemic levels, there are simply too many truckers and not enough demand for shipments by truck. As the laws of supply and demand dictate, an abundance of supply means that prices are going to fall.\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s thrown a wrench in the trucking industry. Recent global developments, such as the war in Ukraine raising fuel prices and a COVID resurgence in China\u2019s export centers causing commodity prices to rise, have made it harder for truckers to make a profit.\nThat said, the decreased demand for consumer goods doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad for truckers. While consumer goods shipments are down, 70-80% of freight consists of manufactured goods, and manufacturing companies are still willing to pay for truck deliveries.\nHow much do owner-operators make per mile?\nOwner-operators generally make 70 to 80% of their load per mile.\nIf we take flatbed rates as an example, a flatbed truck owner-operator stands to make up to $2.51 per mile out of the $3.14 per mile average rate.\nThe rest of the money goes to the trucking company to pay for benefits such as:\nThis is in contrast to company drivers, who may only get 38 to 52 cents per mile with the same load. However, the larger cut that owner-operators get comes with extra risks.\nAlthough they get benefits from their trucking company, owner-operators are still independent contractors who need to do everything themselves.\nWhile owner-operators stand to gain more money, they also need to set aside more cash for life and automotive insurance, fuel and maintenance, and taxes.\nBecause of this, owner-operators are more likely to be experienced truckers. Typically, those who have worked as company drivers for several years want more freedom and the chance to make their own decisions.\nIf you\u2019re a new trucker or are simply averse to taking more risks and responsibilities, you can become a company driver first to gain more experience and confidence.\nHow much does a freight broker charge per load?\nFreight brokers usually charge around 25-35% of the load.\nA freight broker is a middleman between a shipper and the carrier. They take the shipment from the customer and contact a carrier fleet to take the shipment to its destination.\nShippers like working with freight brokers because the broker deals with everything related to the carriers, becoming the single point of contact for updates. On the other side, carriers also like working with freight brokers because they can optimize routes and give the truckers multiple shipments to reduce deadhead miles.\nWhy trucking rates are important\nYour number one goal is to have a profitable trucking business, and keeping up with average trucking rates per mile is the best way to ensure that your business continues to grow. The key to this is having the right cost per mile trucking, so you win jobs and turn a profit.\nHopefully, you\u2019ve learned everything from what is the average rate per mile for hauling freight to standard truck shipping rates per mile in this article.\nTo recap, the truck rates you use for your business can be influenced by the:\nBy becoming an expert on what is the average trucking rate per mile and keeping up with industry trends, you\u2019ll be able to offer competitive prices and attract more customers, meaning more revenue.\nImage credit: Zetong Li via\u00a0Unsplash\nStreamline your business with Method\nStart your free trial \u2014 no credit card, no contract.\nFeatures\nCompany\n\nResources\nSupport\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Method Integration.

    "Document": "\n\t\t\t\t\t  Freight rates: Trucking rates per mile 2024\t\t\t\t\t\nIf you own a trucking business, then you\u2019re probably always on the go. But as most small business owners know, there are times where you need to stop and make sure that your business is bringing in the revenue it should be.\nOur research indicates that figuring out the best trucking rates per mile is the key to making sure that your business remains profitable, but it can also be a complex process as rates are constantly changing.\nBefore getting into the details on trucking rates per mile 2024, it\u2019s important to understand what goes into determining freight truck rates.\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll find out what current trucking rates per mile are and get a refresher on the industry terms to remember as you navigate truck rates.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nHow to calculate trucking  freight rates\nThe trucking rates can be calculated by multiplying your trucking rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points.\nTotal trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles)\nLike other trades jobs, there is a lot that goes into determining the best trucking rate per mile for your business.\nOur findings show that not only do you have to constantly monitor your fuel spend as well as supply and demand, but you also have to take into account your fixed costs.\nBut let\u2019s start with the basics for truck rates per mile.\nA truck freight rate is a price a shipper or broker will pay you, the carrier, to haul a load. The concept is simple, but our research indicates that trucking rates per mile can vary significantly depending on the time of year and current fuel prices.\nWhich can make knowing the national average trucking cost per mile feel like a black box.\nTrucking freight rates are calculated on a per mile basis. Therefore, the most important number when it comes to calculating truck rates is the number of miles between your starting point and the destination.\nBased on our observations, having the average rate per mile for trucking and accurate information about trucking freight rates is essential to properly pricing trips and negotiating rates with your customers.\nBe aware, however, that calculating the overall freight rate depends on various other factors. Below, you\u2019ll find what you need to consider when calculating trucking rates.\nFactor #1: Distance of travel\nImage credit: Nelson Gono via Unsplash\nWhether you\u2019re transporting locally or looking at over the road trucking rates, the distance between destinations is an important part of determining trucking rates per mile.\nYou want to ensure that you have the right mileage from the beginning to avoid any surprises along the way and get the correct per mile trucking rates.\nDouble-check that your driver will not be required to make any long detours because of road closures. Otherwise, you risk job profitability, timing, and changes to the rate per mile for truck drivers.\nFactor #2: The weight of the shipment\nAfter the distance, our findings show that the weight of the shipment is one of the most significant factors for the cost of trucking per mile. It is important to manage the overall weight load for your fleet to control costs and determine your per mile rate for trucking.\nTo be successful at this, you\u2019ll need to consider variables like heavy haul rates per mile, FTL trucking rates, number of passengers, etc.\nOtherwise, you stand to incorrectly answer \u201cWhat is the average freight cost per mile?\u201d.\nWhen it comes to your average per mile rate for freight, it\u2019s best to be on the safe side and start with higher rates per mile for trucking to allow your customer to negotiate while still ensuring revenue for your business.\nWith this approach, your average haulage cost per mile is sure to bring a profit to your business.\nFactor #3: Shipment density\nThe shipment density is another factor that will determine how much room a shipment will take up in your truck and, in turn, your trucking per mile rates.\nDrawing from our experience, once you know the weight of the shipment, calculating the shipment density is simple. All you have to do is divide the cargo weight by its cubic feet.\nFactor #4: Freight classification\nA question that often goes unanswered is \u201cWhat is the average freight rate per mile?\u201d.\nAnd the question makes sense based on our observations given the number of important industry standards to keep up with for freight classification.\nThe National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) has defined 18 classes of shipments that affect freight rates per mile.\nFreight classification is determined by factors such as:\nHaving a thorough knowledge of how to use these factors to calculate trucking rates per mile will ensure that your business remains competitive and profitable.\nOur findings show that most trucking companies charge customers per mile based on factors like:\nYou need to strike a good balance when setting your rates \u2013 setting a low rate may cause you to lose money, while setting a high rate may turn customers away toward cheaper companies.\nA good rule of thumb to stay competitive rate-wise is to keep an eye on both national and local trucking rates. And based on our observations, providing a fair rate with excellent service is the key to getting (and retaining) more customers.\nAt the time of writing, the national average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile. However, this is just a national average, which means your area may have higher or lower rates.\nTo set a fair price for your flatbed truck services, you need to consider things like:\nThrough our practical knowledge, setting a fair per-mile rate means you can pay truckers a fair wage, keep the clients happy, and still a profit.\nAlthough these are the main takeaways on how to calculate trucking rates, you want to ensure that you have the basic industry knowledge to determine other factors that may influence your truck rates.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some key trucking terms, beyond freight trucking rates, to set you up for success.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nThe terms in trucking you need to know\nKeeping up to date with all of the basic trucking terms is an important factor in knowing how to calculate trucking rates and freight cost per mile.\nFirst things first, there are several types of freight trucks, and they are each ideal to haul different cargo. Your freight type will determine your trucking rates per mile as freight costs per mile steeply influence your fuel spend.\nDifferent types of freight trucks include:\nHere are some other industry terms that play a factor in the national trucking rate per mile and that will help you understand what the going rate for freight per mile is.\nConsignor\nThe consignor is the party that is shipping the product you\u2019re transporting. They are also known as the seller and are your customer.\nThe consignor can be:\nThe ownership of the products stays with the consignor until the consignee pays them in full. Still, our investigation demonstrated that that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the liability stays with them.\nConsignee\nA consignee is a recipient of the products being shipped. You can think of them as the buyer, and they can be an individual or a company.\nThe consignee must be physically present to accept the shipment from the consignor unless specifically stated otherwise in the bill of lading.\nCarrier\nImage credit: Quintin Gellar via Pexels\nYour role in the shipping process will be that of the carrier. The carrier is the party in charge of delivering the products to their destination.\nAs a carrier, you\u2019re responsible for receiving the bill of lading and safely transporting items to the consignee.\nBill of lading (BOL)\nThe consignor sends the goods to you, the freight carrier, to ship them to the consignee. However, the ownership of the freight doesn\u2019t legally change until the recipient of the goods signs the bill of lading (BOL).\nA BOL is a document required in the shipping process that involves all parties: the consignor, consignee, and carrier. The consignor and consignee each get a copy of the BOL, and then there is usually a third copy for the bank.\nThe BOL includes relevant details necessary to ship the product and invoice the transaction correctly once it is completed.\nIt includes the following information:\nFree on board point (FOB)\nFree on board (FOB), also known as freight on board, is a term used to indicate whether the buyer or the seller is liable for goods that are lost, damaged, or destroyed during shipping.\nThe FOB shipping point indicates that the title and responsibility of goods transfer from the seller to the buyer when the goods are placed on your delivery vehicle.\nOn the other hand, a FOB destination means that the seller is responsible for the goods until the goods are delivered to the buyer.\nLoss and damage\nAs a carrier, you may have to deal with loss or damage claims from time to time.\nA damage claim involves visible damage to either the goods or the storage container that the goods are in. The damage should be noted on the bill of lading or another delivery document.\nA loss claim is when a shipment is not delivered or when it shows that it was delivered, but the recipient hasn\u2019t received it. This can be due to typography errors in the bill of lading causing the shipment to go to the wrong address.\nFull truckload shipping (FTL)\nFull truckload shipping (FTL) applies to a shipment that takes up an entire trailer. This is a key price variable as it affects the cost of freight per mile.\nWhen it comes to FTL freight rates factors, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s the smallest truck in your fleet or the largest as FTL applies as long as you use up your entire space. Typically, FTL freight will exceed 15,000 pounds.\nThe full truck load cost per mile typically costs a higher rate per mile since your truck is at full capacity.\nLess than truckload (LTL)\nA less than truckload shipment (LTL) doesn\u2019t take up an entire trailer but may need to move between vehicles during the shipping process. For this reason, LTL rates per mile aren\u2019t always standard across jobs and will affect your average LTL cost per mile.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll need to charge your customers a different rate than the average truckload rate per mile if you\u2019re at less than a truckload.\nTrucking rates per mile for LTL will vary depending on how far your company will be taking the shipment.\nLoad rates for trucks\nLoad rates or freight rates are what you charge for a truck to deliver cargo from one place to another.\nLoad rates are typically paid per mile and can be influenced by factors such as:\nAdditional services like warehouse storage, loading and unloading, and automotive insurance may be included in calculating a customer\u2019s load rates.\nOur findings show that load rates also vary depending on the type of cargo being carried because different cargo may need different types of trucks to transport.\nDrayage\nDrayage is a term that involves shipping goods at a short distance via ground freight. Basically, it is the process of moving a large container to your truck.\nBased on our firsthand experience, this may be an extra cost that you have to consider when giving your customer an estimate of the total cost of your services.\nPallets\nPallets are portable platforms used to package items for freight shipping. Pallets come in different sizes, but the most common size that you\u2019ll find is the standard 40 x 48 size to ship items.\nPallets not only make loading and unloading items easier, but they also allow you to maximize space in your truck. This may reduce your total cost and allow you to provide more competitive trucking rates per mile.\nStop keeping unit (SKU)\nAn SKU (Stock keeping unit) is a service identification code. They\u2019re usually displayed alphanumerically or as a barcode.\nSKUs help track products in inventory as they contain all factors required to identify an item, such as:\nHundredweight (CWT)\nA hundredweight, also known as a CWT, is a unit of measurement. In North America, a hundredweight refers to 100 pounds, whereas the British consider a hundredweight to be 112 pounds.\nIn the past, packages that take up less than an entire truckload were measured by CWTs, but it is not common to measure packages by CWT today. Measuring by pounds or kilograms is now the standard.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nIn order to continue to offer competitive trucking rates per mile, you need to know how much do trucking companies charge per mile. Cost per mile is influenced by factors such as:\nFinancing is also a cost that may influence the cost per mile. The cost of financing trucks and trailers ranges from 0% to 30% of revenue.\nAs of July 2021, trucking rates per mile remain steady. Here are the current rates for the most popular freight truck types:\nFuel prices have been steadily increasing over the past year and are a huge variable in knowing how to calculate transportation rates.\nThe national diesel price was sitting at $3.34 per gallon, with a $0.05 increase from June 2021 to July 2021. However, in 2024 prices have increased greatly with high rates of fluctuation when it comes to price and supply availability.\nAverage rate per mile for owner-operators\nIn contrast to company drivers, owner-operators are truckers who own or lease their own trucks. These people usually work with a trucking company to get back-office support and find trucking jobs.\nOwner-operators generally earn about 70 to 80 percent of the loads they take. For example, if flatbed truck transport is $3.14 per mile, the owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. If they\u2019re out on the road often, they may earn up to $156,000 annually.\nWhere does the rest of your per-mile rate go? The remaining 20 to 30 percent goes to your trucking company. An owner-operator at a trucking company benefits from access to cargo jobs, in-house mechanics, and gas station location optimization.\nBeing an owner-operator is a great way to earn more money, but it also means you will be dealing with the stress and finances largely on your own.\nFor example, you\u2019ll have to shoulder truck maintenance, health insurance, and other business expenses.\nIf you\u2019re not prepared to take on the added risk and costs, becoming a company trucker is always viable.\nTrucking rates per mile 2024 FAQs:\nHere are the top questions truckers have in 2024:\nDo trucking companies pay for empty miles?\nEmpty miles, also known as non-revenue or deadhead miles, are miles garnered by the truck when it isn\u2019t earning any revenue.\nBased on our observations, this happens when there\u2019s a load to the destination but no load back. Empty miles range from 33 \u2013 40% of total miles driven, making them very wasteful for your trucking business.\nTo avoid empty miles, try to minimize any unnecessary movement of goods and improve your scheduling so that your trucks are carrying a load as often as possible.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid an empty mile, it\u2019s best to add a portion of it to your rate per mile trucking costs.\nWhat is a good rate per mile for trucking companies to charge?\nAfter putting it to the test, it is difficult to determine an average rate for trucking rates per mile, but if you keep up with industry news, you\u2019ll always have a good idea of average trucking rates.\nTo answer your question on what is the going rate per mile for trucking \u2014 current trucking rates per mile 2024 averages are:\nKeep in mind that these are just average per mile trucking rates, and your business may profit from a different rate. Based on our observations, providing the lowest rates may not be enough to bring your revenue, but a rate that\u2019s too high may price you out of the competition.\nThe same goes for how much you offer your drivers. As per our expertise, you need to know what is the average rate per mile for truck drivers in your area so you can be fair as well as competitive when it comes to wages.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nThe average going rates for trucking per mile are:\nMany things influence trucking freight rates. Some key factors include:\nWhy are trucking rates so low?\nOur findings show that recent trucking rates are low because of a larger supply compared to the available demand.\nWhen the pandemic began, people needed more things shipped, and the for-hire trucking market soared. Trucking companies started large recruiting drives, and many people decided to start trucking businesses of their own.\nBut now that the volume of shipments is falling to pre-pandemic levels, there are simply too many truckers and not enough demand for shipments by truck. As the laws of supply and demand dictate, an abundance of supply means that prices are going to fall.\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s thrown a wrench in the trucking industry. Recent global developments, such as the war in Ukraine raising fuel prices and a COVID resurgence in China\u2019s export centers causing commodity prices to rise, have made it harder for truckers to make a profit.\nThat said, the decreased demand for consumer goods doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad for truckers. While consumer goods shipments are down, 70-80% of freight consists of manufactured goods, and manufacturing companies are still willing to pay for truck deliveries.\nHow much do owner-operators make per mile?\nOwner-operators generally make 70 to 80% of their load per mile.\nIf we take flatbed rates as an example, a flatbed truck owner-operator stands to make up to $2.51 per mile out of the $3.14 per mile average rate.\nThe rest of the money goes to the trucking company to pay for benefits such as:\nThis is in contrast to company drivers, who may only get 38 to 52 cents per mile with the same load. However, the larger cut that owner-operators get comes with extra risks.\nAlthough they get benefits from their trucking company, owner-operators are still independent contractors who need to do everything themselves.\nWhile owner-operators stand to gain more money, they also need to set aside more cash for life and automotive insurance, fuel and maintenance, and taxes.\nBecause of this, owner-operators are more likely to be experienced truckers. Typically, those who have worked as company drivers for several years want more freedom and the chance to make their own decisions.\nIf you\u2019re a new trucker or are simply averse to taking more risks and responsibilities, you can become a company driver first to gain more experience and confidence.\nHow much does a freight broker charge per load?\nFreight brokers usually charge around 25-35% of the load.\nA freight broker is a middleman between a shipper and the carrier. They take the shipment from the customer and contact a carrier fleet to take the shipment to its destination.\nShippers like working with freight brokers because the broker deals with everything related to the carriers, becoming the single point of contact for updates. On the other side, carriers also like working with freight brokers because they can optimize routes and give the truckers multiple shipments to reduce deadhead miles.\nWhy trucking rates are important\nYour number one goal is to have a profitable trucking business, and keeping up with average trucking rates per mile is the best way to ensure that your business continues to grow. The key to this is having the right cost per mile trucking, so you win jobs and turn a profit.\nHopefully, you\u2019ve learned everything from what is the average rate per mile for hauling freight to standard truck shipping rates per mile in this article.\nTo recap, the truck rates you use for your business can be influenced by the:\nBy becoming an expert on what is the average trucking rate per mile and keeping up with industry trends, you\u2019ll be able to offer competitive prices and attract more customers, meaning more revenue.\nImage credit: Zetong Li via\u00a0Unsplash\nStreamline your business with Method\nStart your free trial \u2014 no credit card, no contract.\nFeatures\nCompany\n\nResources\nSupport\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Method Integration.

    "Summarized_Document": "Freight rates: Trucking rates per mile 2024\n\nIf you own a trucking business, ensuring profitability is crucial. Determining the best trucking rates per mile is key, but it can be complex due to constantly changing rates. This guide provides insights into current trucking rates per mile and essential industry terms.\n\nHow to calculate trucking freight rates\n\nTrucking rates are calculated by multiplying the rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points. The total trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles). Factors influencing trucking rates include distance, weight of the shipment, shipment density, and freight classification.\n\nKey factors in calculating trucking rates:\n\n1. Distance of travel: Ensure accurate mileage to avoid surprises and maintain profitability.\n2. Weight of the shipment: Manage overall weight load to control costs.\n3. Shipment density: Calculate by dividing cargo weight by its cubic feet.\n4. Freight classification: The NMFTA defines 18 classes of shipments affecting rates.\n\nTrucking companies charge customers per mile based on these factors. National average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile, but rates vary by area. Setting a fair per-mile rate ensures fair wages for truckers, happy clients, and profitability.\n\nIndustry terms to know:\n\n- Consignor: The party shipping the product.\n- Consignee: The recipient of the products.\n- Carrier: The party delivering the products.\n- Bill of lading (BOL): A document required in the shipping process.\n- Free on board point (FOB): Indicates liability for goods during shipping.\n- Loss and damage: Claims for visible damage or undelivered shipments.\n- Full truckload shipping (FTL): A shipment that takes up an entire trailer.\n- Less than truckload (LTL): A shipment that doesn't take up an entire trailer.\n- Load rates: Charges for delivering cargo, influenced by various factors.\n- Drayage: Shipping goods a short distance via ground freight.\n- Pallets: Portable platforms for packaging items for freight shipping.\n- Stop keeping unit (SKU): A service identification code for tracking products.\n- Hundredweight (CWT): A unit of measurement (100 pounds in North America).\n\nCurrent trucking rates per mile (2024 averages):\n\n- Flatbed: $3.14 per mile\n- Reefer: $3.19 per mile\n- Dry van: $2.50 per mile\n\nOwner-operators generally earn 70-80% of the load per mile.

    "Document": "Amazon Fee Changes 2024: Significant Fee Updates\nAmazon regularly introduces changes to their FBA fulfillment fees in order to complement the changes in the global eCommerce industry. This year, the tech giant introduced significant changes in core Amazon FBA fees and other Amazon selling fees in general, the majority of which will take effect on February 5th, 2024.\nThe upcoming Amazon fee changes are brought about by multiple factors affecting Amazon\u2019s business operations and the eCommerce industry in its totality. The new Amazon fees for 2024 are designed to motivate sellers to utilize the platform\u2019s services to benefit all parties involved, facilitating faster deliveries and ensuring efficient use of space in Amazon fulfillment centers.\nAmazon Fee Changes in 2024 | Summary\nAs Amazon continues to invest in technology, infrastructure, transportation, and people in order to innovate its services, additional costs are bound to be incurred. The changes to Amazon fees are largely focused on fulfillment, referral, storage, unit sales, and returns processing.\nAs an overview of the impact of these changes in Amazon fees, an average increase of $0.15 in fees per unit sold is to be expected by Amazon sellers. However, Amazon emphasizes that such an increase is \u201csignificantly less than other logistics providers.\u201d\nTo further enlighten sellers on the changes in Amazon selling fees this year, here are some core fee adjustments to be implemented in 2024.\nAmazon Referral Fees Update for 2024\nStarting January 15, 2024, there will be some changes in Amazon referral fees for apparel products, while other referral fees will remain unchanged. Apparel products priced at a certain level will be updated.\nAs mentioned, referral fees for other Amazon products will remain unchanged. You may refer on the table below for the referral fees of specific Amazon categories:\n15% for products with a total sales price greater than $10.00\n15% for items with a total sales price greater than $10.00\n8% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $300.00\n8% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $100.00\n15% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $100.00 up to $1,000.00,\n10% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $1,000.00 up to $5,000.00, and\n5% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $5,000.00\n10% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $200.00\n15% for products with a total sales price greater than $15.00\n5% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $250.00\n8% for products with a total sales price greater than $500.00\n3% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $1,500.00\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cReferral fee rates,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFBA Fulfillment Fees (Excluding Apparel)\nOn February 5th, 2024, the new granular rate cards for standard-sized products and large bulky & extra-large size tiers will take effect. Moreover, starting April 15th, 2024, FBA fulfillment fee rates for the aforementioned size tiers will be implemented.\nTo better understand the FBA fulfillment fees in 2024, you may refer to the chart below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cTable 1. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cTable 2. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Table 3. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nInbound and Outbound Fee Changes\nThe new inbound placement service fee aligns with the changes in Amazon seller fees for 2024. Starting March 1st, 2024, there will be an inbound placement service fee for standard and Large Bulky-sized products. The standard-sized products will have an average fee of $0.27 per unit, whereas Large Bulky-sized products will have an average fee of $1.58 per unit.\nThe implementation of this inbound placement service fee will commence 45 days after the products are received. It means that Amazon will start charging sellers inbound placement fees on April 15th, 2024. For reference, you can check the table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA inbound placement service fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA inbound placement service fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nTo minimize or eliminate fees associated with inbound placement services, Amazon recommends opting for the \u201cDiscounted\u201d FBA inbound placement service, provided your shipping plan meets the criteria. This choice will significantly reduce or completely eliminate fees for dispatching your inventory to various inbound locations within the Amazon network.\nIn relation to inbound fees, effective March 1, 2024, Amazon will introduce an inbound defect fee. This particular Amazon fee will cover shipments delivered to the wrong fulfillment center or deleted and abandoned shipments. The below outlines the per-unit inbound defect fee amount.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cInbound defect fees,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFor outbound products, sellers will also observe a reduced FBA fulfillment fee rate of $0.20 per unit for standard-sized products and $0.61 per unit for large bulky-sized products for large bulky-sized products.\nAnother fee update relating to fulfillment fees includes a fulfillment fee discount ranging from $0.04 to $1.32, depending on item size and weight, for eligible products in the Ships in Product Packaging (SIPP) program.\nAccordingly, items certified as SIPP will automatically receive lowered FBA fulfillment fees on each certified unit shipped. You may refer to the table below for the allotted discount per SIPP-certified unit in 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nInventory and Storage Fee Changes\nAmazon recommends that sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon ensure they have a healthy inventory level to minimize order fulfillment costs, including shipping costs.\nIn an effort to promote healthy inventory levels among third-party sellers, Amazon is introducing a low-inventory-level fee for standard-sized products that consistently fall below customer demand. The said fee is set to be implemented on April 1st, 2024, and for guidance may refer to the table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nIn relation to storage fee updates, Amazon indicated that non-peak monthly storage for standard-size product fees will be reduced. Amazon FBA sellers can expect a non-peak monthly inventory storage fees reduction to an average of $0.09 per cubic foot, effective April 1st, 2024. On the other hand, monthly storage fees for non-standard sizes will remain unchanged.\nFurthermore, Amazon will also be introducing more granular fee tiers to the storage utilization surcharge primarily affecting professional sellers.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nAmazon FBA Fees 2024 for Removal, Disposal and Liquidation\nStarting February 5th, 2024, Amazon will implement changes to its removal and disposal order fees. It is worth noting that, for Amazon sellers who place removal or disposal orders before February 5, 2024 the new fees won\u2019t apply. For reference, you can check the table below for the updated 2024 Amazon FBA removal and disposal fees:\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA removal, disposal and liquidation order fee changes,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nAmazon Returns Processing Fee Updates\nStarting June 1st, 2024, returns processing fee will be implemented for high-return rate products in all categories, except apparel and shoes. This Amazon fee update is intended to address operational costs and reduce waste. You may refer to the 2024 returns processing fee table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cReturns processing fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFinal Thought\nThe upcoming Amazon fee changes are relatively minimal, but will definitely affect the average fees paid by sellers. It\u2019s crucial to thoroughly assess these fee increases in the context of your profit margins. The use of Amazon seller tools like an Amazon FBA calculator and an Amazon repricer can prove invaluable in effectively navigating these changes.\nPost navigation\nRelated Posts\nBlog: Home\nAUTHOR:\nIan Kaneshiro, November 5, 2019January 2, 2023\nWith BlackFriday right around the corner there are some important strategic moves you may want\u2026\nAUTHOR:\nNel Ayala, March 10, 2022November 6, 2023\nWith over 5,000 monthly search volume and 2.4 billion search results in 2022, \u201chow to\u2026\nAUTHOR:\nNel Ayala, November 28, 2022November 8, 2023\nWhether you are an Amazon FBA or FBM seller, you will need to follow the\u2026\nStart repricing today with The Game Theory Amazon Repricer\nx\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 | SELLER SNAP | All Rights Reserved\nSeller Snap offers you a fully automated Amazon Repricer, applying Game Theory tactics to guarantee the best possible performance no matter how the competition changes.

    "Document": "Amazon Fee Changes 2024: Significant Fee Updates\nAmazon regularly introduces changes to their FBA fulfillment fees in order to complement the changes in the global eCommerce industry. This year, the tech giant introduced significant changes in core Amazon FBA fees and other Amazon selling fees in general, the majority of which will take effect on February 5th, 2024.\nThe upcoming Amazon fee changes are brought about by multiple factors affecting Amazon\u2019s business operations and the eCommerce industry in its totality. The new Amazon fees for 2024 are designed to motivate sellers to utilize the platform\u2019s services to benefit all parties involved, facilitating faster deliveries and ensuring efficient use of space in Amazon fulfillment centers.\nAmazon Fee Changes in 2024 | Summary\nAs Amazon continues to invest in technology, infrastructure, transportation, and people in order to innovate its services, additional costs are bound to be incurred. The changes to Amazon fees are largely focused on fulfillment, referral, storage, unit sales, and returns processing.\nAs an overview of the impact of these changes in Amazon fees, an average increase of $0.15 in fees per unit sold is to be expected by Amazon sellers. However, Amazon emphasizes that such an increase is \u201csignificantly less than other logistics providers.\u201d\nTo further enlighten sellers on the changes in Amazon selling fees this year, here are some core fee adjustments to be implemented in 2024.\nAmazon Referral Fees Update for 2024\nStarting January 15, 2024, there will be some changes in Amazon referral fees for apparel products, while other referral fees will remain unchanged. Apparel products priced at a certain level will be updated.\nAs mentioned, referral fees for other Amazon products will remain unchanged. You may refer on the table below for the referral fees of specific Amazon categories:\n15% for products with a total sales price greater than $10.00\n15% for items with a total sales price greater than $10.00\n8% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $300.00\n8% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $100.00\n15% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $100.00 up to $1,000.00,\n10% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $1,000.00 up to $5,000.00, and\n5% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $5,000.00\n10% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $200.00\n15% for products with a total sales price greater than $15.00\n5% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $250.00\n8% for products with a total sales price greater than $500.00\n3% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $1,500.00\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cReferral fee rates,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFBA Fulfillment Fees (Excluding Apparel)\nOn February 5th, 2024, the new granular rate cards for standard-sized products and large bulky & extra-large size tiers will take effect. Moreover, starting April 15th, 2024, FBA fulfillment fee rates for the aforementioned size tiers will be implemented.\nTo better understand the FBA fulfillment fees in 2024, you may refer to the chart below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cTable 1. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cTable 2. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Table 3. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nInbound and Outbound Fee Changes\nThe new inbound placement service fee aligns with the changes in Amazon seller fees for 2024. Starting March 1st, 2024, there will be an inbound placement service fee for standard and Large Bulky-sized products. The standard-sized products will have an average fee of $0.27 per unit, whereas Large Bulky-sized products will have an average fee of $1.58 per unit.\nThe implementation of this inbound placement service fee will commence 45 days after the products are received. It means that Amazon will start charging sellers inbound placement fees on April 15th, 2024. For reference, you can check the table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA inbound placement service fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA inbound placement service fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nTo minimize or eliminate fees associated with inbound placement services, Amazon recommends opting for the \u201cDiscounted\u201d FBA inbound placement service, provided your shipping plan meets the criteria. This choice will significantly reduce or completely eliminate fees for dispatching your inventory to various inbound locations within the Amazon network.\nIn relation to inbound fees, effective March 1, 2024, Amazon will introduce an inbound defect fee. This particular Amazon fee will cover shipments delivered to the wrong fulfillment center or deleted and abandoned shipments. The below outlines the per-unit inbound defect fee amount.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cInbound defect fees,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFor outbound products, sellers will also observe a reduced FBA fulfillment fee rate of $0.20 per unit for standard-sized products and $0.61 per unit for large bulky-sized products for large bulky-sized products.\nAnother fee update relating to fulfillment fees includes a fulfillment fee discount ranging from $0.04 to $1.32, depending on item size and weight, for eligible products in the Ships in Product Packaging (SIPP) program.\nAccordingly, items certified as SIPP will automatically receive lowered FBA fulfillment fees on each certified unit shipped. You may refer to the table below for the allotted discount per SIPP-certified unit in 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nInventory and Storage Fee Changes\nAmazon recommends that sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon ensure they have a healthy inventory level to minimize order fulfillment costs, including shipping costs.\nIn an effort to promote healthy inventory levels among third-party sellers, Amazon is introducing a low-inventory-level fee for standard-sized products that consistently fall below customer demand. The said fee is set to be implemented on April 1st, 2024, and for guidance may refer to the table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nIn relation to storage fee updates, Amazon indicated that non-peak monthly storage for standard-size product fees will be reduced. Amazon FBA sellers can expect a non-peak monthly inventory storage fees reduction to an average of $0.09 per cubic foot, effective April 1st, 2024. On the other hand, monthly storage fees for non-standard sizes will remain unchanged.\nFurthermore, Amazon will also be introducing more granular fee tiers to the storage utilization surcharge primarily affecting professional sellers.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nAmazon FBA Fees 2024 for Removal, Disposal and Liquidation\nStarting February 5th, 2024, Amazon will implement changes to its removal and disposal order fees. It is worth noting that, for Amazon sellers who place removal or disposal orders before February 5, 2024 the new fees won\u2019t apply. For reference, you can check the table below for the updated 2024 Amazon FBA removal and disposal fees:\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA removal, disposal and liquidation order fee changes,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nAmazon Returns Processing Fee Updates\nStarting June 1st, 2024, returns processing fee will be implemented for high-return rate products in all categories, except apparel and shoes. This Amazon fee update is intended to address operational costs and reduce waste. You may refer to the 2024 returns processing fee table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cReturns processing fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFinal Thought\nThe upcoming Amazon fee changes are relatively minimal, but will definitely affect the average fees paid by sellers. It\u2019s crucial to thoroughly assess these fee increases in the context of your profit margins. The use of Amazon seller tools like an Amazon FBA calculator and an Amazon repricer can prove invaluable in effectively navigating these changes.\nPost navigation\nRelated Posts\nBlog: Home\nAUTHOR:\nIan Kaneshiro, November 5, 2019January 2, 2023\nWith BlackFriday right around the corner there are some important strategic moves you may want\u2026\nAUTHOR:\nNel Ayala, March 10, 2022November 6, 2023\nWith over 5,000 monthly search volume and 2.4 billion search results in 2022, \u201chow to\u2026\nAUTHOR:\nNel Ayala, November 28, 2022November 8, 2023\nWhether you are an Amazon FBA or FBM seller, you will need to follow the\u2026\nStart repricing today with The Game Theory Amazon Repricer\nx\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 | SELLER SNAP | All Rights Reserved\nSeller Snap offers you a fully automated Amazon Repricer, applying Game Theory tactics to guarantee the best possible performance no matter how the competition changes.

Significant business model issues have been starting to manifest for fleets already deploying battery-electric trucks.\nIn many respects, Sanchez\u2019s message echoed that of J.B. Hunt President Shelley Simpson the previous day.\nBEV Technology is Still in its Infancy\nLooking at diesel versus electric in light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Sanchez said that while Ryder expected to see cost increases for adopting BEVs instead of conventional diesel trucks, they did not expect to see the magnitude of those costs, which he cited as a major barrier to widespread adoption at the current time.\n\u201cWe know the commercial EVs beyond light-duty transit vans are not ready for mass adoption due to price range and payload limitations,\u201d Sanchez told show attendees.\n\u201cWe also know that we have a lack of critical charging infrastructure, and we would [have to] make major improvements to their power grid in order to support it.\n\u201cFrom our point of view, for commercial EVs to work in the real world, we need a breakthrough in battery technology and an expansion of the charging infrastructure. We need an inflection point.\u201d\nToday's EVs are Like the First Mobile Phones\nSanchez produced a vintage Motorola \u201cbrick\u201d cell phone from the podium to make his next point: That BEV technology \u2014 much like the brick cell phone in the late 1970s \u2014 is still in the very earliest stage of its development path.\nOver time, of course, cellphone technology improved exponentially. Better batteries were developed. Phones got smaller. And, as more and more capabilities were added, they eventually evolved into smartphones.\nThere\u2019s a distinct parallel between the evolution of cellular and commercial zero-emissions vehicle technology, Sanchez said. Like the cell phone, he added, the industry needs electric vehicle costs to come down.\n\u201cWe need smaller, lighter and more powerful battery technology to improve the range and capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need a nationwide infrastructure. We need the fastest applicable charges available where professional drivers can conveniently charge their trucks.\u201d\nWe Need a Technological Breakthrough\nThe North American trucking industry clearly needs a new technological breakthrough to drive capabilities up and costs down. The problem, Sanchez cautioned, is that we don\u2019t know when that breakthrough will come, and what kind of changes it will bring.\nThe real-world numbers highlight the scope of issue.\n\u201cAt Ryder, we have a stable of nearly 250,000 commercial vehicles,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd only 60 of those trucks are EVs.\n\u201cWe also have 40,000 commercial vehicle customers. And so far, only 18 of them have chosen to deploy EVs in their fleets.\u201d\nThose figures hold true for the North American trucking industry at large, Sanchez added. He said that there are nearly 16 million commercial vehicles in service in North America today. And to date, only 28,000 of them are EVs.\n\u201cThe problem is not lack of interest,\u201d Sanchez explained. \u201cWe have many customers who asked about the cost benefit of converting to EVs. We found that there was significant barrier to conversion in the total cost of transport, or the TCT.\u201d\nTCT, he explained, includes the cost of vehicle, fuel or electricity, driver wages, as well as other factors that go into transporting the same load the same distance and achieving the equivalent delivery times.\nThe business case for converting to BEV technology just isn\u2019t there yet, Sanchez said.\nIn fact, he added, if you take the average load that is currently being moved by a heavy-duty diesel truck today and convert that tractor to electric, it requires nearly two vehicles and more than two trailers to deliver the same load at the same time as one diesel vehicle, at more than double TCT.\n\u201cI think most of you would agree that this is a tough sell.\u201d\nThe Diesel and Electric Total Cost of Transport Gap\nRyder did the math to better understand how significant the TCT gap between diesel and battery-electric trucks actually is. The results are detailed in a white paper, \u201cCharged Logistics: The cost of electric vehicle conversion for U.S. commercial fleets.\u201d\nRyder analyzed the total cost to transport, in one-to-one comparisons, for transitioning Class 4 (light-duty), Class 6 (medium-duty), and Class 8 (heavy-duty) vehicles operating in California and Georgia from internal combustion engines to EVs in today\u2019s market.\nThen it also examined the TCT for transitioning a mixed fleet (light, medium, and heavy) of 25 ICE vehicles to EVs. The mix was based on the overall mix of commercial vehicles in the U.S. according to Polk Data Services.\nThe analysis is based on representative network loads and routes from Ryder\u2019s dedicated fleet operations, which includes more than 13,000 commercial vehicles and professional drivers, as well as the impact of EV charging time and maximum payload to achieve equivalent delivery times.\nCritical factors include general labor, energy costs, loads and routes, Sanchez explained.\n\u201cWe then factored in a number of cost assumptions using current market prices for vehicles, maintenance, fuel, and charging infrastructure. We also factored in driver\u2019s wages, other professional costs, as well as general and administrative expenses.\u201d\nThen, Ryder took the range and payload capabilities needed to achieve equivalent diesel delivery targets and ran the numbers.\n\u201cIt currently costs about $170,000 a year to run the light-duty diesel Transit van,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cFor electric vehicles, that cost increases an estimated 3%. The cost of the vehicle nearly doubles. However, maintenance cost savings largely offset the increase in vehicle cost.\u201d\nThe additional driver hours needed for EV charging time in Georgia costs a fleet about $156,000 per year. And while equipment maintenance costs remain the same as that of California, Sanchez noted, Georgia\u2019s lower fuel and energy costs do not provide the same level of savings while transitioning from diesel to electric. All this results in a higher cost disadvantage for Georgia than California.\nHeavy-Duty Comparison\nAs the study moved from light-duty to larger vehicles, the cost benefits start to wane even more.\nLooking at Class 8, in Georgia, it costs a fleet about $291,000 to run a diesel-powered truck. In California, it\u2019s about $334,000 per year.\nBut given current BEV range and payload limitations, Sanchez said it could require nearly twice the equipment and more than twice the labor compared to a diesel truck for fleets to deliver the same loads.\nSo for that same fleet in Georgia, an electric truck would take $622,438 to deliver the same loads.\nIn California, the cost to deliver those same loads with electric would cost $648,712.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs and 56% to 67% to convert mixed fleets of 25 vehicles, depending on which state.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs.\nImage: HDT graphic\nUltimately, consumers will have to pay for those prices increases.\n\u201cKeep in mind that nearly three-quarters of all goods in the U.S. are transported by trucks,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSo if you extrapolate the TCT analysis for the entire U.S. fleet of commercial vehicles to a 100% transition to EVs, and passing the average total cost of transport on to consumers, we estimate that this increased costs cumulatively adding from .5% to 1% in overall inflation.\u201d\nCan the Cost Parity Gap Be Closed?\nSanchez said the purpose of Ryder\u2019s analysis is to quantify the current gap in cost between diesel and EVS and to identify the cost drivers.\nThis, in turn, will help equipment manufacturers, technology companies, innovators, and regulators to better focus their ZEV development efforts.\n\u201cWe believe those to be advanced battery technology to address payload and range limitations, reducing vehicle costs, and building out sufficient charging networks and delivering power,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe believe [by addressing] those three areas \u2026 we can start to close the gap and created a cost parity between diesel and electric trucks.\u201d\nThere are also multiple ways to reduce vehicle emissions, including electric, natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, as well as continuing to advance diesel emissions technology, Sanchez added.\n\u201cPeople and businesses will see the benefits of zero-emission vehicles,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAnd mass adoption will follow.

    "Summarized_Document": "While Ryder anticipated cost increases for adopting battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) over conventional diesel trucks, the actual costs were higher than expected. Robert Sanchez, Ryder System\u2019s CEO, highlighted this during his keynote at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo (ACT Expo) in Las Vegas on May 22, 2024. Despite advancements in zero-emission powertrain technologies, significant business model issues have emerged for fleets using BEVs. Sanchez compared the current state of BEV technology to the early stages of mobile phones, emphasizing the need for breakthroughs in battery technology and charging infrastructure.Ryder's analysis of the total cost of transport (TCT) for Class 4, Class 6, and Class 8 vehicles in California and Georgia revealed substantial cost disparities between diesel and electric trucks. For instance, running a light-duty diesel Transit van costs about $170,000 annually, while an electric version increases costs by 3%. For heavy-duty trucks, the cost to run a diesel truck in Georgia is approximately $291,000, compared to $622,438 for an electric truck. In California, these costs are $334,000 for diesel and $648,712 for electric.Overall, Ryder estimates a 94% to 114% cost increase for converting heavy-duty trucks to EVs and a 56% to 67% increase for mixed fleets of 25 vehicles. These increased costs could add 0.5% to 1% to overall inflation if passed on to consumers. Sanchez stressed the need for advancements in battery technology, vehicle cost reduction, and charging infrastructure to close the cost parity gap between diesel and electric trucks. He also mentioned other emission reduction methods, including natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, and advanced diesel emissions technology.",

Significant business model issues have been starting to manifest for fleets already deploying battery-electric trucks.\nIn many respects, Sanchez\u2019s message echoed that of J.B. Hunt President Shelley Simpson the previous day.\nBEV Technology is Still in its Infancy\nLooking at diesel versus electric in light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Sanchez said that while Ryder expected to see cost increases for adopting BEVs instead of conventional diesel trucks, they did not expect to see the magnitude of those costs, which he cited as a major barrier to widespread adoption at the current time.\n\u201cWe know the commercial EVs beyond light-duty transit vans are not ready for mass adoption due to price range and payload limitations,\u201d Sanchez told show attendees.\n\u201cWe also know that we have a lack of critical charging infrastructure, and we would [have to] make major improvements to their power grid in order to support it.\n\u201cFrom our point of view, for commercial EVs to work in the real world, we need a breakthrough in battery technology and an expansion of the charging infrastructure. We need an inflection point.\u201d\nToday's EVs are Like the First Mobile Phones\nSanchez produced a vintage Motorola \u201cbrick\u201d cell phone from the podium to make his next point: That BEV technology \u2014 much like the brick cell phone in the late 1970s \u2014 is still in the very earliest stage of its development path.\nOver time, of course, cellphone technology improved exponentially. Better batteries were developed. Phones got smaller. And, as more and more capabilities were added, they eventually evolved into smartphones.\nThere\u2019s a distinct parallel between the evolution of cellular and commercial zero-emissions vehicle technology, Sanchez said.

    "Summarized_Document": "While Ryder anticipated cost increases for adopting battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) over conventional diesel trucks, the actual costs were higher than expected. Robert Sanchez, Ryder System\u2019s CEO, highlighted this during his keynote at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo (ACT Expo) in Las Vegas on May 22, 2024. Despite advancements in zero-emission powertrain technologies, significant business model issues have emerged for fleets using BEVs. Sanchez compared the current state of BEV technology to the early stages of mobile phones, emphasizing the need for breakthroughs in battery technology and charging infrastructure.Ryder's analysis of the total cost of transport (TCT) for Class 4, Class 6, and Class 8 vehicles in California and Georgia revealed substantial cost disparities between diesel and electric trucks. For instance, running a light-duty diesel Transit van costs about $170,000 annually, while an electric version increases costs by 3%. For heavy-duty trucks, the cost to run a diesel truck in Georgia is approximately $291,000, compared to $622,438 for an electric truck. In California, these costs are $334,000 for diesel and $648,712 for electric.Overall, Ryder estimates a 94% to 114% cost increase for converting heavy-duty trucks to EVs and a 56% to 67% increase for mixed fleets of 25 vehicles. These increased costs could add 0.5% to 1% to overall inflation if passed on to consumers. Sanchez stressed the need for advancements in battery technology, vehicle cost reduction, and charging infrastructure to close the cost parity gap between diesel and electric trucks. He also mentioned other emission reduction methods, including natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, and advanced diesel emissions technology.",

Significant business model issues have been starting to manifest for fleets already deploying battery-electric trucks.\nIn many respects, Sanchez\u2019s message echoed that of J.B. Hunt President Shelley Simpson the previous day.\nBEV Technology is Still in its Infancy\nLooking at diesel versus electric in light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Sanchez said that while Ryder expected to see cost increases for adopting BEVs instead of conventional diesel trucks, they did not expect to see the magnitude of those costs, which he cited as a major barrier to widespread adoption at the current time.\n\u201cWe know the commercial EVs beyond light-duty transit vans are not ready for mass adoption due to price range and payload limitations,\u201d Sanchez told show attendees.\n\u201cWe also know that we have a lack of critical charging infrastructure, and we would [have to] make major improvements to their power grid in order to support it.\n\u201cFrom our point of view, for commercial EVs to work in the real world, we need a breakthrough in battery technology and an expansion of the charging infrastructure. We need an inflection point.\u201d\nToday's EVs are Like the First Mobile Phones\nSanchez produced a vintage Motorola \u201cbrick\u201d cell phone from the podium to make his next point: That BEV technology \u2014 much like the brick cell phone in the late 1970s \u2014 is still in the very earliest stage of its development path.\nOver time, of course, cellphone technology improved exponentially. Better batteries were developed. Phones got smaller. And, as more and more capabilities were added, they eventually evolved into smartphones.\nThere\u2019s a distinct parallel between the evolution of cellular and commercial zero-emissions vehicle technology, Sanchez said. Like the cell phone, he added, the industry needs electric vehicle costs to come down.\n\u201cWe need smaller, lighter and more powerful battery technology to improve the range and capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need a nationwide infrastructure. We need the fastest applicable charges available where professional drivers can conveniently charge their trucks.\u201d\nWe Need a Technological Breakthrough\nThe North American trucking industry clearly needs a new technological breakthrough to drive capabilities up and costs down. The problem, Sanchez cautioned, is that we don\u2019t know when that breakthrough will come, and what kind of changes it will bring.\nThe real-world numbers highlight the scope of issue.\n\u201cAt Ryder, we have a stable of nearly 250,000 commercial vehicles,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd only 60 of those trucks are EVs.\n\u201cWe also have 40,000 commercial vehicle customers. And so far, only 18 of them have chosen to deploy EVs in their fleets.\u201d\nThose figures hold true for the North American trucking industry at large, Sanchez added. He said that there are nearly 16 million commercial vehicles in service in North America today. And to date, only 28,000 of them are EVs.\n\u201cThe problem is not lack of interest,\u201d Sanchez explained. \u201cWe have many customers who asked about the cost benefit of converting to EVs. We found that there was significant barrier to conversion in the total cost of transport, or the TCT.\u201d\nTCT, he explained, includes the cost of vehicle, fuel or electricity, driver wages, as well as other factors that go into transporting the same load the same distance and achieving the equivalent delivery times.\nThe business case for converting to BEV technology just isn\u2019t there yet, Sanchez said.\nIn fact, he added, if you take the average load that is currently being moved by a heavy-duty diesel truck today and convert that tractor to electric, it requires nearly two vehicles and more than two trailers to deliver the same load at the same time as one diesel vehicle, at more than double TCT.\n\u201cI think most of you would agree that this is a tough sell.\u201d\nThe Diesel and Electric Total Cost of Transport Gap\nRyder did the math to better understand how significant the TCT gap between diesel and battery-electric trucks actually is. The results are detailed in a white paper, \u201cCharged Logistics: The cost of electric vehicle conversion for U.S. commercial fleets.\u201d\nRyder analyzed the total cost to transport, in one-to-one comparisons, for transitioning Class 4 (light-duty), Class 6 (medium-duty), and Class 8 (heavy-duty) vehicles operating in California and Georgia from internal combustion engines to EVs in today\u2019s market.\nThen it also examined the TCT for transitioning a mixed fleet (light, medium, and heavy) of 25 ICE vehicles to EVs. The mix was based on the overall mix of commercial vehicles in the U.S. according to Polk Data Services.\nThe analysis is based on representative network loads and routes from Ryder\u2019s dedicated fleet operations, which includes more than 13,000 commercial vehicles and professional drivers, as well as the impact of EV charging time and maximum payload to achieve equivalent delivery times.\nCritical factors include general labor, energy costs, loads and routes, Sanchez explained.\n\u201cWe then factored in a number of cost assumptions using current market prices for vehicles, maintenance, fuel, and charging infrastructure. We also factored in driver\u2019s wages, other professional costs, as well as general and administrative expenses.\u201d\nThen, Ryder took the range and payload capabilities needed to achieve equivalent diesel delivery targets and ran the numbers.\n\u201cIt currently costs about $170,000 a year to run the light-duty diesel Transit van,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cFor electric vehicles, that cost increases an estimated 3%. The cost of the vehicle nearly doubles. However, maintenance cost savings largely offset the increase in vehicle cost.\u201d\nThe additional driver hours needed for EV charging time in Georgia costs a fleet about $156,000 per year. And while equipment maintenance costs remain the same as that of California, Sanchez noted, Georgia\u2019s lower fuel and energy costs do not provide the same level of savings while transitioning from diesel to electric. All this results in a higher cost disadvantage for Georgia than California.\nHeavy-Duty Comparison\nAs the study moved from light-duty to larger vehicles, the cost benefits start to wane even more.\nLooking at Class 8, in Georgia, it costs a fleet about $291,000 to run a diesel-powered truck. In California, it\u2019s about $334,000 per year.\nBut given current BEV range and payload limitations, Sanchez said it could require nearly twice the equipment and more than twice the labor compared to a diesel truck for fleets to deliver the same loads.\nSo for that same fleet in Georgia, an electric truck would take $622,438 to deliver the same loads.\nIn California, the cost to deliver those same loads with electric would cost $648,712.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs and 56% to 67% to convert mixed fleets of 25 vehicles, depending on which state.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs.\nImage: HDT graphic\nUltimately, consumers will have to pay for those prices increases.\n\u201cKeep in mind that nearly three-quarters of all goods in the U.S. are transported by trucks,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSo if you extrapolate the TCT analysis for the entire U.S. fleet of commercial vehicles to a 100% transition to EVs, and passing the average total cost of transport on to consumers, we estimate that this increased costs cumulatively adding from .5% to 1% in overall inflation.\u201d\nCan the Cost Parity Gap Be Closed?\nSanchez said the purpose of Ryder\u2019s analysis is to quantify the current gap in cost between diesel and EVS and to identify the cost drivers.\nThis, in turn, will help equipment manufacturers, technology companies, innovators, and regulators to better focus their ZEV development efforts.\n\u201cWe believe those to be advanced battery technology to address payload and range limitations, reducing vehicle costs, and building out sufficient charging networks and delivering power,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe believe [by addressing] those three areas \u2026 we can start to close the gap and created a cost parity between diesel and electric trucks.\u201d\nThere are also multiple ways to reduce vehicle emissions, including electric, natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, as well as continuing to advance diesel emissions technology, Sanchez added.\n\u201cPeople and businesses will see the benefits of zero-emission vehicles,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAnd mass adoption will follow. It will take all of us in this room and throughout the industry, working together to strike a balance between encouraging innovation, safeguarding the interests of businesses and consumers and the environment alignment. And I believe this is key for a successful transition to a zero-emissions future.\u201d\nThe Rush to Battery-Electric Trucks: Putting the Cart Before the Horse\nExecutive Editor\n\r\n                    Jack Roberts is known for reporting on advanced technology, such as intelligent drivetrains and autonomous vehicles.

    "Document_ID": "DOC_121",
    "Document": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

    "Document": "How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? [DHL Delivery Time]\nEvery time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver?\nDHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites.\nRead on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it.\nHow Long Does DHL Take to Deliver?\nDHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites.\nDHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily.\nThis logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments.\nDHL Delivery Times\nTo answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines:\nThe process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them.\nUnder this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support.\nWith the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this.\nAs for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them.\nDHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping.\nHow long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days.\nHowever, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month.\nAside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time. These include the shape, size, and type of the item inside the package. Suffice it to say that these are also the factors affecting delivery cost.\nDHL Domestic and International Shipping Time\nFor domestic deliveries, shipping typically takes roughly 3 to 8 business days. This applies to standard shipping.\nAs for DHL\u2019s international shipping, the standard shipping takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks. At the same time, its expedited shipping takes 4 to 12 business days. Again, the delivery time depends on several factors.\nDHL Delivery Delays\nDHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others.\nWhen these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays. You may also visit the DHL website to get updated about their latest advisories.\nDHL Domestic Shipping\nDomestic delivery times and delivery rates are posted on the DHL website.\nDHL offers different types of domestic deliveries based on weight. These include the following:\nLet\u2019s discuss the features of each of them:\n1. DHL SmartMail Parcel\nThe DHL Smart Parcel is a delivery service for parcels with a maximum weight of 16 oz. The parcel should also have a maximum dimension of 27 inches in length x 17 inches in width x 17 inches in height. Also, the length and girth must be less than or equal to 50 inches.\nUnder the DHL SmartMail Parcel, you can choose from three delivery service levels, which include:\nThis type of delivery service does not have any delivery area or residential surcharge. Saturday delivery is also free of charge. At the same time, DHL offers a Shipment Value Protection with a maximum amount of $100.\nIt also offers a free end-to-end tracking service accessible via the DHL Customer Web Portal.\n2. DHL SmartMail Parcel Plus\nThis type of DHL delivery service is ideal for parcels with weights ranging between 1 and 25 lbs. The parcel should also have a maximum dimension of 27 inches in length x 17 inches in width x 17 inches in height.

DHL Delivery Times To answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines: The process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them. Under this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support. With the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this. As for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon.

DHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping. How long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days. However, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month. Aside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time. These include the shape, size, and type of the item inside the package. Suffice it to say that these are also the factors affecting delivery cost. DHL Domestic and International Shipping Time For domestic deliveries, shipping typically takes roughly 3 to 8 business days. This applies to standard shipping. As for DHL\u2019s international shipping, the standard shipping takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks. At the same time, its expedited shipping takes 4 to 12 business days. Again, the delivery time depends on several factors. DHL Delivery Delays DHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others. When these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive.

    "Summarized_Document": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",

    "Summarized_Document": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",

    "Document": "What is a Good LSAT Score? 2024 Data\nAre you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results?\nIf so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What\u00a0is\u00a0a good LSAT score?\nThen you\u2019re in the right place.\nReady? Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them.

    "Summarized_Document": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score.

    "Summarized_Document": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

    "Document": "What is a Good LSAT Score? 2024 Data\nAre you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results?\nIf so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What\u00a0is\u00a0a good LSAT score?\nThen you\u2019re in the right place.\nReady? Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score. An LSAT score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program.\nYou just need to have the right kind of application.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the median LSAT score, let\u2019s move on to the highest scores.\nWhat is the highest LSAT score?\u00a0\nLSAT scores can range anywhere from 120 to 180.\nGetting a perfect 180 on the LSAT is practically unheard of. In fact, just 0.1% of test-takers have achieved it.\nA 170 is considered a great score, as it would mean you got at least 90 of the 101 questions on the test right.\u00a0\nDoing so would put you in the top 2-3% of test takers, meaning you would get into most law schools.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the kind of LSAT scores you would need to be accepted into the top 10 law schools in the country.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for the top 10 law schools?\u00a0\nIf you want to\u00a0attend one of the top 10 law schools in the country, you should aim for an LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the low, median, and high LSAT scores at each school.\nStanford University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nYale University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0175\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0178\nUniversity of Chicago\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (Carey)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0167\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nDuke University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0168\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0170\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0171\nHarvard University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0174\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nNew York University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0174\nColumbia University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Virginia\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nNorthwestern University (Pritzker)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0172\nAs you can see, each of these schools has a median LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nBut even with a lower score, you can still get in.\nKeep reading to learn how.\nHow important are LSAT scores for law school admissions?\nIt\u2019s true that a higher score will increase your chances of acceptance into the law school of your choice.\nTypically, a score that falls within the 150 range is considered average. While it will get you accepted into most law schools, it could make it difficult to stand out.\nA score of at least 160 is considered strong, and most law schools have median scores within this range. However, keep in mind that scholarships may require higher scores.\nLast but not least, a score of 170 or more puts you comfortably among the top 2-3% of test-takers and will certainly get the attention of some of the best law schools in the country.\nBut I want to let you in on a secret: Your admission doesn\u2019t hinge solely on your LSAT score.\nYour\u00a0undergraduate GPA\u00a0also plays a part in it.\nAccording to the ABA,\u00a0the average GPA among admitted law school students\u00a0is around 3.6. But just like LSAT scores, that average varies across schools.\nAmong students who get into top-tier law schools like the ones mentioned earlier, the average GPA is 3.8 or higher.\nWhile both your GPA and LSAT scores are important factors in determining how successful you would be as a law school student, schools tend to weigh the LSAT more heavily.\nBut even if you score a couple of points lower than the median LSAT score or GPA at your number one school of choice, don\u2019t let it keep you from applying.\nThe law school admission process is a holistic one, which means that they\u2019ll look at more than just your score.\nIt all comes down to being able to prove you have what it takes to succeed as a law student in your application. With the right strategy, application elements like your personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation will help you stand out.\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on average LSAT scores and the kind of scores needed for top schools, let\u2019s move on to the three different types of LSAT scores.\nHow does LSAT work?\u00a0\nWhen talking about LSAT scores, most people only talk about the numbers, like 150, 170, or 180.\nBut there are actually\u00a0three\u00a0types of LSAT scores you should be aware of.\nThe first is called the raw score. Your raw score reflects the number of questions you answered correctly on the test.\nFor instance, if an LSAT was made up of 100 questions and you got 85 correct, you would score an 85.\nThe second type of score is a scaled score, which is the kind of score you\u2019re probably most familiar with.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0the kind of score that reads 150, 170, or 180.\u00a0\nA scaled score is what you get when you convert your raw score into an LSAT score based on the Score Conversion Chart. In this chart, scores range from 120 to 180.\nFinally, there\u2019s a percentile score, which shows how well you tested compared to others who have taken the LSAT over the last three years.\u00a0\nNext steps\nThere you have it! Everything you need to know about what makes for a good LSAT score.\nDon\u2019t let the pressure of a high LSAT score keep you from trying.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right kind of application strategy.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve worked with several students who have scored well beneath the median and still gone on to receive admission letters.\nIf you want to make sure you\u2019re a top candidate, sign up for my\u00a0on-demand workshop today. I\u2019ll let you in on exactly what it takes to stand out and get accepted.\nRead more:\nLSAT Anxiety: Tips and Tricks to Boost Your ScoreCan You Get Into Law School With a Low LSAT Score?\nHi!\nHope you enjoy this blog post!

    "Summarized_Document": "New York City Independent Budget Office (IBO) provides detailed data on public school attendance and academic performance for the 2017-2018 school year. The overall attendance rate for all students in traditional public schools was 91.3%, with male students at 90.9% and female students at 91.6%. Attendance rates varied by race/ethnicity, with Asian or Pacific Islander students having the highest rate at 94.9% and Black students the lowest at 89.3%. Special education students had an attendance rate of 88.1%, compared to 92.1% for general education students. Performance levels in English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics for grades 3-8 were also reported. In traditional public schools, 23.4% of students scored at level 1 in ELA, 29.8% at level 2, 27.7% at level 3, and 19.0% at level 4. In Mathematics, 32.3% scored at level 1, 24.9% at level 2, 21.3% at level 3, and 21.5% at level 4. Charter school students performed differently, with 13.5% at level 1 in ELA, 29.2% at level 2, 37.8% at level 3, and 19.6% at level 4. In Mathematics, 17.8% scored at level 1, 22.7% at level 2, 26.3% at level 3, and 33.3% at level 4.Performance data was further broken down by race/ethnicity and gender. For example, Asian female students in traditional public schools had 9.1% at level 1 in ELA and 39.5% at level 4, while Asian male students had 14.5% at level 1 and 30.1% at level 4. Black female students had 23.5% at level 1 and 13.6% at level 4, while Black male students had 37.9% at level 1 and 6.9% at level 4.The document also provided performance data for English Language Learners (ELL) and students with special education needs. ELL students in traditional public schools had 58.8% at level 1 in ELA and 0.7% at level 4, while English proficient students had 18.1% at level 1 and 21.8% at level 4. Special education students had 53.2% at level 1 in ELA and 2.8% at level 4, compared to general education students with 15.6% at level 1 and 23.3% at level 4.Attendance and performance were also analyzed based on chronic absenteeism. Students with good attendance had 20.2% at level 1 in ELA and 21.8% at level 4, while chronically absent students had 34.8% at level 1 and 8.2% at level 4. Severely chronically absent students had 46.3% at level 1 and 4.6% at level 4.The document provides a comprehensive overview of attendance and academic performance in New York City public schools, highlighting disparities across different student groups.",

The overall attendance rate for all students in traditional public schools was 91.3%, with male students at 90.9% and female students at 91.6%. Attendance rates varied by race/ethnicity, with Asian or Pacific Islander students having the highest rate at 94.9% and Black students the lowest at 89.3%. Special education students had an attendance rate of 88.1%, compared to 92.1% for general education students. Performance levels in English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics for grades 3-8 were also reported. In traditional public schools, 23.4% of students scored at level 1 in ELA, 29.8% at level 2, 27.7% at level 3, and 19.0% at level 4. In Mathematics, 32.3% scored at level 1, 24.9% at level 2, 21.3% at level 3, and 21.5% at level 4. Charter school students performed differently, with 13.5% at level 1 in ELA, 29.2% at level 2, 37.8% at level 3, and 19.6% at level 4. In Mathematics, 17.8% scored at level 1, 22.7% at level 2, 26.3% at level 3, and 33.3% at level 4.Performance data was further broken down by race/ethnicity and gender. For example, Asian female students in traditional public schools had 9.1% at level 1 in ELA and 39.5% at level 4, while Asian male students had 14.5% at level 1 and 30.1% at level 4. Black female students had 23.5% at level 1 and 13.6% at level 4, while Black male students had 37.9% at level 1 and 6.9% at level 4.The document also provided performance data for English Language Learners (ELL) and students with special education needs. ELL students in traditional public schools had 58.8% at level 1 in ELA and 0.7% at level 4, while English proficient students had 18.1% at level 1 and 21.8% at level 4. Special education students had 53.2% at level 1 in ELA and 2.8% at level 4, compared to general education students with 15.6% at level 1 and 23.3% at level 4.Attendance and performance were also analyzed based on chronic absenteeism. Students with good attendance had 20.2% at level 1 in ELA and 21.8% at level 4, while chronically absent students had 34.8% at level 1 and 8.2% at level 4. Severely chronically absent students had 46.3% at level 1 and 4.6% at level 4.The document provides a comprehensive overview of attendance and academic performance in New York City public schools, highlighting disparities across different student groups.",

The C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health asked a national sample of parents of children in middle and high school about participation in school activities.\nParents reported that over 80% of their middle and high school-age children would participate in at least one type of school activity for the 2018-19 school year, including 52% in sports, 43% in arts activities, and 51% clubs/other activities. Nearly half (46%) of middle and high school-age children were expected to participate in more than one type of school activity.\nRequired school participation fees averaged $161 for sports, $86 for arts, and $46 for clubs/other activities. For sports, 18% of students had school participation fees of $200 or more, compared to 12% for arts and 5% for clubs/other activities; there was little difference between middle and high school fees. In contrast, more students had a participation fee of $0 for arts (64%) or clubs (66%) compared to sports (46%). When combining participation fees with other expenses such as equipment and travel, the total cost averaged $408 for sports, $251 for arts, and $126 for clubs/other activities.\nNearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school activities is higher than they expected. Ten percent of parents felt the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost, including three times as many lower-income parents (18% less than $50,000 vs 6% more than $100,000). Only 7% of parents had ever requested a waiver or scholarship for participation fees; 19% said they didn\u2019t know how, and 5% were not comfortable making such a request.\nParents reported that 18% of their middle and high school-age children would not participate in any school activities in 2018-19. Non-participation was higher among boys than girls (21% vs 15%), and for students from lower-income households (25% less than $50,000 vs 12% over $100,000). Reasons for non-participation cited more often for boys were cost, transportation, and having a job; not being interested in activities was cited more often for girls. Non-participation was three times higher for children of parents who said the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost, and nearly twice as high for children of parents who said the cost of school activities is more than they expected.\nHighlights\nImplications\nSchool activities offer an array of benefits to middle and high school students: opportunities to explore different interests, make new friends, hone an existing skill or talent, and develop leadership and teamwork skills. Participation in school activities is linked to higher educational achievement.\nParticipation in school activities is widespread. According to parents responding to this Mott Poll, over 80% of their middle or high school students are participating in a school activity for the 2018-19 school year. These activities range from exploratory options like intramurals sports or afterschool clubs, to higher-intensity options like varsity sports, competition arts groups, or student council.\nMany school activities have a fee to participate, and those fees can be a barrier to participation. Most schools strive to offer a range of activities, including some with no fees; in addition, many schools provide scholarships or waivers to assist students with fees. Despite these efforts, elevated rates of non-participation among lower-income students continues to be a problem, as noted in our earlier reports from 2012, 2015, and 2016.\nIn this Mott Poll, 1 in 6 students (18%) at both the middle and high school level are not participating in any school activities for the 2018-19 school year. The income gap persists, as students from households earning less than $100,000 have twice the level of non-participation as their peers from wealthier households.\nTwo key parent attitudes that may explain some of the discrepancy. Nearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school extracurricular activities is higher than they expected, and 10% of parents said the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost. The children of parents who express either of these attitudes are less likely to participate in school activities.\nParents concerned about cost may not be aware of no-cost activities or knowledgeable about fee waivers. Only 7% of parents who responded to this Mott Poll had ever requested a waiver or scholarship for participation fees. In contrast, nearly one quarter of parents were \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d for assistance: those who didn\u2019t know about waivers (19%) and those who were not comfortable requesting one (5%). School officials can address the ongoing problem of non-participation by informing students and parents about no-cost activities, as well as waivers and scholarship options, and by emphasizing the benefits of school activities to parents who may be hesitant.\nThis Mott Poll also highlights the continuing trend of sports being more expensive than other types of school activities. The average participation fee was substantially higher for sports than for arts or clubs, as was the total cost of participation, with little difference between middle and high school costs. Also concerning are trends over time. A previous report for the 2015-16 school year found an average sports participation fee of $139; that average fee increased to $161 in this current Mott Poll Report, while the average fees for arts and clubs did not increase. The same pattern occurs for total costs. Moreover, no-cost options continue to be less common for sports than for arts and clubs.\nThe higher costs of sports, compared to other activities, may be contributing to the higher level of non-participation among boys. Boys have slightly greater participation in sports activities overall compared to girls (53% vs 49%), and more boys than girls participate in sports only (21% vs 10%). Thus, the disproportionately higher cost of sports may be more likely to impact boys.\nData Source & Methods\nThis report presents findings from a nationally representative household survey conducted exclusively by GfK Custom Research, LLC (GfK), for C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital. The survey was administered in October 2018 to a randomly selected, stratified group of parents age 18 and older (n=2,007). Adults were selected from GfK\u2019s web-enabled KnowledgePanel\u00ae that closely resembles the U.S. population. The sample was subsequently weighted to reflect population figures from the Census Bureau. The survey completion rate was 60% among panel members contacted to participate. This report is based on responses from 961 parents who reported on 1,323 children in middle or high school. The margin of error is \u00b11 to 6 percentage points.\nFindings from the C.S.

The C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health asked a national sample of parents of children in middle and high school about participation in school activities.\nParents reported that over 80% of their middle and high school-age children would participate in at least one type of school activity for the 2018-19 school year, including 52% in sports, 43% in arts activities, and 51% clubs/other activities. Nearly half (46%) of middle and high school-age children were expected to participate in more than one type of school activity.\nRequired school participation fees averaged $161 for sports, $86 for arts, and $46 for clubs/other activities. For sports, 18% of students had school participation fees of $200 or more, compared to 12% for arts and 5% for clubs/other activities; there was little difference between middle and high school fees. In contrast, more students had a participation fee of $0 for arts (64%) or clubs (66%) compared to sports (46%). When combining participation fees with other expenses such as equipment and travel, the total cost averaged $408 for sports, $251 for arts, and $126 for clubs/other activities.\nNearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school activities is higher than they expected. Ten percent of parents felt the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost, including three times as many lower-income parents (18% less than $50,000 vs 6% more than $100,000). Only 7% of parents had ever requested a waiver or scholarship for participation fees; 19% said they didn\u2019t know how, and 5% were not comfortable making such a request.\nParents reported that 18% of their middle and high school-age children would not participate in any school activities in 2018-19. Non-participation was higher among boys than girls (21% vs 15%), and for students from lower-income households (25% less than $50,000 vs 12% over $100,000). Reasons for non-participation cited more often for boys were cost, transportation, and having a job; not being interested in activities was cited more often for girls. Non-participation was three times higher for children of parents who said the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost, and nearly twice as high for children of parents who said the cost of school activities is more than they expected.\nHighlights\nImplications\nSchool activities offer an array of benefits to middle and high school students: opportunities to explore different interests, make new friends, hone an existing skill or talent, and develop leadership and teamwork skills. Participation in school activities is linked to higher educational achievement.\nParticipation in school activities is widespread. According to parents responding to this Mott Poll, over 80% of their middle or high school students are participating in a school activity for the 2018-19 school year. These activities range from exploratory options like intramurals sports or afterschool clubs, to higher-intensity options like varsity sports, competition arts groups, or student council.\nMany school activities have a fee to participate, and those fees can be a barrier to participation. Most schools strive to offer a range of activities, including some with no fees; in addition, many schools provide scholarships or waivers to assist students with fees. Despite these efforts, elevated rates of non-participation among lower-income students continues to be a problem, as noted in our earlier reports from 2012, 2015, and 2016.\nIn this Mott Poll, 1 in 6 students (18%) at both the middle and high school level are not participating in any school activities for the 2018-19 school year. The income gap persists, as students from households earning less than $100,000 have twice the level of non-participation as their peers from wealthier households.\nTwo key parent attitudes that may explain some of the discrepancy. Nearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school extracurricular activities is higher than they expected, and 10% of parents said the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost. The children of parents who express either of these attitudes are less likely to participate in school activities.\nParents concerned about cost may not be aware of no-cost activities or knowledgeable about fee waivers. Only 7% of parents who responded to this Mott Poll had ever requested a waiver or scholarship for participation fees. In contrast, nearly one quarter of parents were \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d for assistance: those who didn\u2019t know about waivers (19%) and those who were not comfortable requesting one (5%). School officials can address the ongoing problem of non-participation by informing students and parents about no-cost activities, as well as waivers and scholarship options, and by emphasizing the benefits of school activities to parents who may be hesitant.\nThis Mott Poll also highlights the continuing trend of sports being more expensive than other types of school activities. The average participation fee was substantially higher for sports than for arts or clubs, as was the total cost of participation, with little difference between middle and high school costs. Also concerning are trends over time. A previous report for the 2015-16 school year found an average sports participation fee of $139; that average fee increased to $161 in this current Mott Poll Report, while the average fees for arts and clubs did not increase. The same pattern occurs for total costs. Moreover, no-cost options continue to be less common for sports than for arts and clubs.\nThe higher costs of sports, compared to other activities, may be contributing to the higher level of non-participation among boys. Boys have slightly greater participation in sports activities overall compared to girls (53% vs 49%), and more boys than girls participate in sports only (21% vs 10%). Thus, the disproportionately higher cost of sports may be more likely to impact boys.\nData Source & Methods\nThis report presents findings from a nationally representative household survey conducted exclusively by GfK Custom Research, LLC (GfK), for C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital. The survey was administered in October 2018 to a randomly selected, stratified group of parents age 18 and older (n=2,007). Adults were selected from GfK\u2019s web-enabled KnowledgePanel\u00ae that closely resembles the U.S. population. The sample was subsequently weighted to reflect population figures from the Census Bureau. The survey completion rate was 60% among panel members contacted to participate. This report is based on responses from 961 parents who reported on 1,323 children in middle or high school. The margin of error is \u00b11 to 6 percentage points.\nFindings from the C.S.
