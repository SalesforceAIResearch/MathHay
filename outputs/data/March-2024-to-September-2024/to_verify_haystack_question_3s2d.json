Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company\u2019s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia\u2019s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%.\nNvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion.\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That\u2019s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year.\nGaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion.\nAnalysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%.\nInvestors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter.\nEven if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results.\nThat could have been a sign that some investors weren\u2019t impressed with Nvidia\u2019s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time.\nInvestors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company\u2019s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips.\n (NVDA)\nAt the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What\u2019s more, he said the company\u2019s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter.\nNvidia, however, is also facing an uncertain future, with president-elect Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. He\u2019s also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.\nThe vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock\u2019s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I\u2019ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm\u2019s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla\u2019s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla\u2019s \u201cdifficult environment,\u201d the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it\u2019s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla\u2019s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla\u2019s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA\u2019s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla\u2019s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla\u2019s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company\u2019s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%.\nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla\u2019s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles.\nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that\u2019s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Mitigation plans involve massive engineering feats that may help in the short-term, but will eventually be overrun.\nEarth.Org takes a closer look.\n\u2014\nA major centre of finance, commerce, culture, arts and trade, Miami is a global city with a USD $345 billion GDP. Built on a broad, low-lying plain between Everglades wetlands and Biscayne Bay, its citizens are already experiencing early signs of climate change.\nWhy?\nSince 1870, global sea levels have risen by an average of 20 cm, but Southeast Florida\u2019s local levels have risen by 30 cm. By 2060, it could double or triple that.\u00a0\nThe impacts of sea level rise in Miami\nIn light of the last point, officials have decided to build a network of huge pumps that force water out of flood-prone areas and into Biscayne Bay. There are over 30 pumps today, with 90 planned in total. The estimated cost for 3 pumps, including land acquisition, is USD $ 200 million. Unfortunately, even all 90 cannot protect the larger Miami area.\u00a0\nThe city of Miami still toils away to mitigate flooding, raising roads and buildings, hoping to buy time. The world would do well to keep an eye on how Miami fares, as it may be the first major victim of climate change.\nEarth.Org has mapped severe flooding in southern Florida by the end of the century to illustrate the impending danger.\nSea Level Rise: Miami\u2019s Map\nSea level rise projections by 2100 for two scenarios with the amount of rise in meters indicated (mild = 1m; extreme = 4m). Percentage and total population displacement indicated bottom right, yellow star on the city of Miami.\nMethodology\nGlobal mean sea level is projected to rise by 2m at the end of this century. However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level. While in extreme cases like China and the Netherlands it could experience 5-10m of extreme sea levels. Here, the coastal local flood level is added on top of the projected SLR.\nPollution Scenario:\nAllows choosing the RCP, the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory defined by the IPCC.\u00a0 The mild level is based on RCP4.5, of 2\u00b0C temperature rise; while the Extreme level is based on RCP 8.5, of 4\u00b0C temperature rise.\nLuck:\nApplies to the baseline SLR, defined in the \u201cSea level projection\u201d section, upon which we add flooding. \u201cMild\u201d refers to the mid-range scenario of 0.5-1.2m, and \u201cextreme\u201d to the pessimistic scenario of 1-2.5m.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

Agencies and organizations are working to prepare people as their world changes around them, and NASA information is helping these efforts.\nThe agency\u2019s global data is now available in the sea level section of the Earth Information Center. NASA developed the global sea level change website in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, the World Bank, the U.S. Department of State, and the United Nations Development Programme. \u00a0\nThe site includes information on projected sea level rise through the year 2150 for coastlines around the world, as well as estimates of how much flooding a coastal community or region can expect to see in the next 30 years. The projections come from data collected by NASA and its partners and from computer models of ice sheets and the ocean, as well as the latest sea level assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other sources.\n\u201cNASA innovates for the benefit of humanity. Our cutting-edge instruments and data-driven information tools help communities and organizations respond to natural hazards and extreme weather, and inform critical coastal infrastructure planning decisions,\u201d said Karen St. Germain, director of the Earth science division at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nInformation to Action\nInternational organizations such as the World Bank will use the data from the global sea level change site for tasks including the creation of Climate Risk Profiles for countries especially vulnerable to sea level rise.\nThe Defense Department will continue to incorporate sea level rise data into its plans to anticipate and respond to hazards posed to its facilities by the effects of rising oceans. Similarly, the State Department uses the information for activities ranging from disaster preparedness to long-term adaptation planning to supporting partners around the world in related efforts.\n\u201cWe are at a moment of truth in our fight against the climate crisis. The science is unequivocal and must serve as the bedrock upon which decision-making is built. With many communities around the world already facing severe impacts from sea-level rise, this new resource provides a vital tool to help them protect lives and livelihoods. It also illustrates what is at stake between a 1.5-degree-Celsius world and a current-policies trajectory for all coastal communities worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Secretary-General Selwin Hart, special adviser to the United Nations secretary-general on climate action and just transition.\nRising Faster\nNASA-led data analyses have revealed that between 1970 and 2023, 96% of countries with coastlines have experienced sea level rise. The rate of that global rise has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) per year in 1993 to about 0.18 inches (0.45 centimeters) per year in 2023.\nAs the rate of sea level rise increases, millions of people could face the related effects sooner than previously projected, including larger storm surges, more saltwater intrusion into groundwater, and additional high-tide flood days \u2014 also known as nuisance floods or sunny day floods.\n\u201cThis new platform shows the timing of future floods and the magnitude of rising waters in all coastal countries worldwide, connecting science and physics to impacts on people\u2019s livelihoods and safety,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director of the ocean physics program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nData released earlier this year found that Pacific Island nations will experience at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) of sea level rise in the next 30 years. The number of high-tide flood days will increase by an order of magnitude for nearly all Pacific Island nations by the 2050s.\n\u201cThe data is clear: Sea levels are rising around the world, and they\u2019re rising faster and faster,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and head of the agency\u2019s sea level change science team. \u201cHaving the best information to make decisions about how to plan for rising seas is more crucial than ever.\u201d\nTo explore the global sea level change site:\nhttps://earth.gov/sealevel\nNews Media Contacts\nKaren Fox / Elizabeth VlockNASA Headquarters, Washington202-358-1600karen.c.fox@nasa.gov / elizabeth.a.vlock@nasa.gov\nJane J.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

      "\n\t\t\tCalifornia\u2019s intensive care nightmare: Which hospitals are full?\t\t\nShare this:\nIn summary\nIn the worst-hit counties, some hospitals are sending critically ill patients to other counties. Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family.

      "\n\t\t\tCalifornia\u2019s intensive care nightmare: Which hospitals are full?\t\t\nShare this:\nIn summary\nIn the worst-hit counties, some hospitals are sending critically ill patients to other counties. Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired.

      "Signal Timing\n\u00a0\nWhy Correct Signal Timing is so Important\n(Read the Full Report)\nAt signalized intersections, the period between conflicting green phases is known as the change interval.\u00a0 It is composed of a yellow signal phase plus an optional all-red interval.\u00a0 The purpose of the yellow phase is to alert drivers that their right-of-way is about to end and, depending upon their relative proximity to the intersection, to permit them to come to a safe stop or allow them time to clear the limit line prior to the onset of the red phase. The purpose of the all-red interval is to allow vehicles which have lega1ly entered the intersection prior to the onset of the red signal to clear any potential points of conflict before the release of opposing vehicles or pedestrians.\nTransportation officials and engineers know that the proper timing of the change interval is essential to intersection safety.\u00a0 If the yellow signal phase is too short, a \u201cdilemma zone\u201d is created.\u00a0 Motorists who are unfortunate enough to be within this section of the roadway when the yellow signal illuminates may neither be able to stop safely nor legally enter the intersection before the onset of the red phase.\u00a0 Dilemma zones virtually assure that some percentage of drivers will be forced to brake suddenly or violate the red, thereby creating the potential for rear end collisions or vehicle conflicts within the intersection.\u00a0 If the all-red interval is insufficient, vehicles from the previous green phase may not have completely cleared the intersection prior to the release of cross traffic.\u00a0 Again, this generates the potential for vehicle conflicts including highly dangerous broadside collisions within the intersection.\nWhen both the yellow and all-red phases are too short, a significant safety hazard is created.\u00a0 Some drivers will be forced to violate the red due to the too-short yellow and cross traffic will be released before they completely clear the intersection. Intersections which exhibit a higher than average number of red-light related collisions most likely have either a yellow phase or all-red phase which is too short.\u00a0 Often times, both problems exist at the same intersection.\u00a0 Correcting the signal timing will most likely eliminate the vast majority of collisions at these locations.\nHow the Yellow Phase is Determined\nA mathematical formula established by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) is used to calculate the minimum safe time for the yellow signal and is primarily based on the speed of the traffic approaching the intersection and the reaction time of the average driver.\nThe ITE specifies the 85th percentile speed of free flow traffic be used as the approach speed to ensure that the yellow phase provides sufficient stopping time for at least 85% of the vehicles approaching the intersection.\u00a0 California law requires the use of the 85th percentile speed or the posted speed limit.\u00a0 However, if the posted speed limit is used and the 85th percentile speed is substantially greater, then the yellow phase will be under-timed and a safety hazard will exist as a significant number of drivers will encounter a dilemma zone.\u00a0 For example, if the yellow signal is timed for 35 mph, the yellow light will be set at 3.6 seconds, but if the 85th percentile speed of traffic is 45 mph the yellow signal should be 4.3 seconds, too short by almost 1 full second.\u00a0 While this difference may not seem like much, it will often make the difference between whether or not a violation occurs.\nDriver perception-reaction time, is the time between the onset of the yellow phase and when the vehicle\u2019s brakes engage.\u00a0 During this time, the driver must see the light change from green to yellow, perceive the meaning of the change, decide whether they are able to safely stop or if they should continue through the intersection, and if they decide to stop, move their foot off the accelerator and apply the brakes. The ITE suggests that a value of 1 second be used for this variable.\u00a0 However, a number of studies suggest that this figure may not adequately account for driver perception-reaction times, especially in an urban environment such as Los Angeles due to \u201ccognitive overload\u201d where the reaction time may actually be closer to 1.5 seconds.\nMaximizing Safety through Longer Yellow Timing\nSafety dictates that the yellow signal time be calculated using the 85th percentile speed of free flow traffic approaching the intersection based on a current traffic survey.\u00a0 When a survey is unavailable, the 85th percentile speed should be assumed to be at least 10 mph above the posted speed limit.\u00a0 Likewise, in the interest of safety, driver reaction time should be assumed to be at least 1.4 seconds.\u00a0 Together, this change would likely increase the yellow time at many intersections by about 1 second and significantly improve safety.\nThe safety benefit of longer yellow signal times has been proven in a number of studies.\u00a0 A Texas DOT study found that when the yellow interval is set one second longer than the minimum time, violations decreased by 53% and crashes decreased by 40%.\nThe chart below shows a similar 30% to 55% reduction in violations achieved at San Diego red-light camera sites when the yellow interval times were increased.\n\nLikewise, the following two figures show how Fairfax County, VA achieved a significant, sustained reduction in violations when the yellow timing was increased\nby \u00bd second.\u00a0 Note also that red-light cameras were present during the entire review period, but a dramatic reduction in violations was seen only after the yellow timing was increased.\n\n\nAs for concerns that drivers will modify their behavior to account for the longer yellow light and still run the red, the data shows that such an adjustment does not happen provided the yellow time does not exceed about 5.5 seconds.\nHow the All-Red Clearance Phase is Determined\nThe ITE uses another formula to calculate the appropriate all-red phase which takes into consideration the width of the intersection and the speed of traffic. In contrast to the formula for the yellow signal timing this formula uses the speed of the slowest 15% of drivers to ensure that these vehicles have sufficient time to clear the intersection prior to the release of cross traffic.\u00a0 Generally the 15th percentile speed can be assumed to be 5 \u2013 10 mph below the posted speed limit.\nMaximizing Safety through a Longer All-Red Phase\nAs discussed previously, the purpose of the all-red phase is to allow vehicles that enter the intersection in the last moments of the yellow phase to clear the intersection prior to release of cross traffic or pedestrians.\u00a0 Wider intersections necessarily require longer all-red phases.\u00a0 A vehicle traveling at 35 mph will require just over 2 seconds to clear an intersection 90 feet wide and 2.83 seconds to completely clear an intersection 125 feet wide.\u00a0 Slower vehicles would require more time to clear those intersections.\u00a0 These clearance intervals provide a sufficient all-red phase to clear any vehicles that cross the limit line just as the signal changes from yellow to red.\u00a0 However, in real world situations, some drivers will enter the intersection just after the signal turns to red.\u00a0 This is often due to yellow times that are too short, drivers who simply miscalculate the time it will take them to reach the limit line before the yellow phase ends, or drivers who hesitate or slow momentarily before deciding they have sufficient time to make it into the intersection before the red illuminates.\u00a0\u00a0 The 2004 Texas DOT study determined that when a red light violation occurs, about 60 percent of the time it occurs within the first half second of the red phase.\u00a0 The distribution of red light violations as a function of time-into-red appears in the figure below.\n\nIn order to minimize the chance that collisions will occur at signalized intersections, the all-red clearance interval must be long enough to allow all vehicles to clear the intersection before cross traffic is released.\u00a0 This interval should be extended slightly to account for vehicles that enter the intersection just after the red phase begins.\u00a0 For example, a vehicle traveling at 35 mph would require approximately 2 seconds to clear an 80 foot wide intersection.\u00a0 However, if the driver miscalculates or hesitates and enters the intersection \u00bd second after the light turns red, his vehicle will not completely clear the intersection until 2.5 seconds after the red phase begins.\u00a0 In this situation, the 2 second all-red clearance interval dictated by the ITE formula would not be sufficient to prevent a possible vehicle conflict within the intersection.\u00a0 While it may not be desirable to increase the all-red phase to account for every vehicle that might enter the intersection after the red phase begins, extending the all-red phase \u00bd second beyond the time calculated using the ITE formula would prevent collisions that might be caused by the 60% of violations that occur immediately after the onset of red.\u00a0 This could add an additional measure of safety without unduly reducing traffic flow.\nExisting Conditions at Los Angeles Intersections\nAs part of an ongoing study of traffic safety in Los Angeles, Safer Streets L.A. identified intersections within the city with a higher than average number of red-light related collisions.\u00a0 Without exception, we found that either the yellow time, the all-red phase or both are currently below the ITE minimums based on the actual speed of traffic at these locations and therefore insufficient to provide the margin of safety necessary to protect the motoring public.\u00a0 In some cases the yellow signal time is 1 full second too short and the all-red phase is a much as 2 seconds too short.\nUnquestionably, at intersections where red-light related accidents are over represented, an engineering deficiency exists.\u00a0 As explained above, drivers in an urban environment such as L.A. may need additional reaction time to respond to the yellow signal and routinely travel at 10 mph or more beyond the posted speed limit.\u00a0 Therefore, it would be prudent to extend the yellow signal time at least 1 second and extend the all-red clearance interval at least 0.5 seconds beyond the ITE minimums.\u00a0 Additional engineering improvements may be necessary at some intersections to be determined based on a comprehensive engineering survey.\nThe City of Los Angeles now has an economical option available that would achieve a greater safety benefit than the proposed multi-million dollar red-light camera program.\u00a0 The cost to change signal timing is insignificant.\u00a0 The City can swiftly achieve a reduction in accidents as well as violations at numerous signalized intersections simply by extending the yellow and all-red signal phases.\u00a0 There is no reason not to immediately implement these strategies at problem intersections.\u00a0 Failure to do so not only puts the motoring public at risk, it leaves the City open to the possibility of litigation should injuries or fatalities occur due to deficient signal timing.\n(Read the Full Report)\nJoin the National Motorists Association to learn more and continue the fight for your driving rights.\n\nYour donation is tax deductible.\nRecent

      "MOTOR\nResults for {phrase}\n\nAutomotive Data since 1903\n\nDealer Service Satisfaction Improves but Appointment Wait Times Continue to Grow\nDealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments\nBy J.D. Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience. The study measures satisfaction with service at franchised dealer or aftermarket service facilities for maintenance or repair work among owners and lessees of one- to three-year-old vehicles.\nIt also provides a numerical index ranking of the highest-performing automotive brands sold in the United States, which is based on the combined scores of five measures that comprise the vehicle owner service experience. These measures are (in order of importance): service quality; service advisor; vehicle pick-up; service facility; and service initiation. In 2023, model segment rankings were added to the study to differentiate between the service needs of cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans.\nFollowing are key findings of the 2024 study:\nHighest-Ranking Brands and Segments\n\u2022 Lexus\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among premium brands for a third consecutive year, with a score of 897.\u00a0Porsche\u00a0(894) ranks second and\u00a0Cadillac\u00a0(883) ranks third.\n\u2022 Buick\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among mass market brands with a score of 887.\u00a0MINI\u00a0(884) ranks second and\u00a0Subaru\u00a0(877) ranks third.\n\u2022 MINI (877) ranks highest in the mass market car segment, followed by Subaru (874) and\u00a0Mazda\u00a0(867).\n\u2022 Buick ranks highest among mass market SUVs/minivans with a score of 887.\u00a0Mitsubishi\u00a0(877) and Subaru (877) each rank second in a tie.\n\u2022 Porsche (902) ranks highest in the premium car segment, followed by\u00a0Infiniti\u00a0(900) and Lexus (892).\n\u2022 Lexus ranks highest in the premium SUV segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 898. Porsche (889) ranks second and Cadillac (882) ranks third.Nissan\u00a0ranks highest in the truck segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 873.\u00a0Chevrolet\u00a0(856) ranks second and\u00a0Toyota\u00a0(855) ranks third.\n\n\n\n\nNo results found.\nGet The Newsletter\ncontact a sales person\nSupport Center\nMOTOR Magazine\n\u00a9 2024 Hearst Business Publishing, Inc. | \r\n                         Privacy policy | \r\n                         MEDIA | \r\n                         Black Book\n"

      "MOTOR\nResults for {phrase}\n\nAutomotive Data since 1903\n\nDealer Service Satisfaction Improves but Appointment Wait Times Continue to Grow\nDealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments\nBy J.D. Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience. The study measures satisfaction with service at franchised dealer or aftermarket service facilities for maintenance or repair work among owners and lessees of one- to three-year-old vehicles.\nIt also provides a numerical index ranking of the highest-performing automotive brands sold in the United States, which is based on the combined scores of five measures that comprise the vehicle owner service experience. These measures are (in order of importance): service quality; service advisor; vehicle pick-up; service facility; and service initiation. In 2023, model segment rankings were added to the study to differentiate between the service needs of cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans.\nFollowing are key findings of the 2024 study:\nHighest-Ranking Brands and Segments\n\u2022 Lexus\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among premium brands for a third consecutive year, with a score of 897.\u00a0Porsche\u00a0(894) ranks second and\u00a0Cadillac\u00a0(883) ranks third.\n\u2022 Buick\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among mass market brands with a score of 887.\u00a0MINI\u00a0(884) ranks second and\u00a0Subaru\u00a0(877) ranks third.\n\u2022 MINI (877) ranks highest in the mass market car segment, followed by Subaru (874) and\u00a0Mazda\u00a0(867).\n\u2022 Buick ranks highest among mass market SUVs/minivans with a score of 887.\u00a0Mitsubishi\u00a0(877) and Subaru (877) each rank second in a tie.\n\u2022 Porsche (902) ranks highest in the premium car segment, followed by\u00a0Infiniti\u00a0(900) and Lexus (892).\n\u2022 Lexus ranks highest in the premium SUV segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 898. Porsche (889) ranks second and Cadillac (882) ranks third.Nissan\u00a0ranks highest in the truck segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 873.\u00a0Chevrolet\u00a0(856) ranks second and\u00a0Toyota\u00a0(855) ranks third.\n\n\n\n\nNo results found.\nGet The Newsletter\ncontact a sales person\nSupport Center\nMOTOR Magazine\n\u00a9 2024 Hearst Business Publishing, Inc. | \r\n                         Privacy policy | \r\n                         MEDIA | \r\n                         Black Book\n",

Travel times will be reduced by up to 20% during peak traffic periods. Adjustments were also made to the timing during other parts of the day to make signals more responsive to side-street traffic and pedestrians while still keeping Dodge Street moving smoothly.\nPedestrian safety benefits along the corridor include the implementation of 72 new leading pedestrian interval phases. A reprogrammed walk signal with leading pedestrian intervals displays a walk signal before a green light, allowing pedestrians a head start in crossing the street to establish a more visible presence in the intersection before vehicles are allowed to turn right or left. Cycle lengths at Dodge Street signals were lowered during 18 hours of a typical weekday, resulting in lower overall delays for pedestrians and drivers.\nThe Public Works Department has developed a series of traffic safety videos on topics such as the signal technology enhancements rolling out across Omaha, pedestrian and driver safety, and flashing yellow arrow signals.

For many industrial manufacturers, the response of the supply network to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical challenges, and natural disasters thrust supply chain resilience into the limelight. But the pendulum appears to be swinging back, with costs and margin pressures once again at the forefront as companies reevaluate their supply chains.\nAs of early 2024, supply chain pressures have fallen from the unprecedented levels following the COVID-19 pandemic.1 The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Manufacturers\u2019 Outlook Survey for fourth quarter of 2023 revealed that, in the last two years, 86.2% of respondents have worked to de-risk their supply chains.2 Many companies are now prioritizing a resilient yet efficient supply chain. They are working to optimize the balance between performance and cost by restructuring their supply chain. These approaches include expanding to locations in the United States, or to locations closer to end consumers, and also working more closely with free trade partners of the United States.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nIndustrial manufacturers are finding advantages in countries across North America and Asia. They are exploring both \u201cnearshoring\u201d options in Canada and Mexico and \u201creshoring\u201d options in the United States. The share of US trade in goods with China has declined from 21.2% in 2018 to 13.9% in 2023. While Mexico has overtaken China to become the lead US trading partner, accounting for a 15.4% share (figure 1), Mexican trade with China has simultaneously increased.3 Now, manufacturers are likely exploring ways to ensure that their Tier 2 and Tier 3 supply networks are sufficiently networked to reduce their raw material and key component exposure.\nOther nearshoring options such as Canada, as well as potential Asian trading partners like India, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, have experienced growth. This restructuring is occurring globally and is not exclusive to the United States, nor is it a North American phenomenon. In fact, at the end of 2023, 97% of companies surveyed in the Economist Impact\u2019s \u201cTrade in Transition 2024\u201d project stated they were reconfiguring their supply chains in some way, as compared to 92% in 2022.4\nThese changes beg the questions: What are industrial manufacturing and construction companies considering with respect to performance and cost as they restructure their supply chains? And how are they doing the restructuring?\nShare image\nOr copy link\nSupply chain efficiency is motivating industrial manufacturers to restructure their supply base\nAs global supply chains have normalized\u00a0following the pandemic, chief executive officers are likely beginning to shift their strategic focus toward profitable growth.5 Part of the strategy for many, for maintaining healthy margins, is rooted in reducing company exposure to supply chain disruption while employing cost reduction techniques and capitalizing on government policies supporting domestic growth.\nGeopolitical instability and disruptions keep the focus on delivery and lead times\nAs CEOs look to keep their company exposure low, their concerns over the indirect impacts of geopolitical instabilities on supply chains have grown.6 And, after a period of decline, the end of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 saw an uptick in supply chain challenges as a primary business issue for manufacturers (figure 2).7 This, in turn, has led to increased transit times worldwide.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nIndustry leaders expect that global shipping may experience up to 20-day delays in deliveries in the coming months.8 Deloitte\u2019s US economic forecast for the first quarter of 2024 suggests that the situation in the Red Sea may persist,9 potentially upending the progress made in lead times since 2022. In particular, the average lead time of production materials in April 2024 was 79 days. While this is a 21% reduction from the peak of 100 days reached in July 2022, it is still higher than 2019 levels, which averaged around 65 days (figure 3).10\nLonger lead times can threaten manufacturing processes, and ultimately business continuity, for companies across the value chain. In the face of recent disruptions, the Manufacturing Supplier Deliveries Index rose to 48.9 in April 2024 from 47 in December 2023.11 The increase in the index signals a slowdown in the delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations, largely due to raw material supply chains.12 While delivery performance showed a trend of significant improvement with average delivery decreases of 72.8 in 2021 to 57.3 in 2022 and 46 in 2023, it increased in the first quarter of 2024 to 49.7.13 This increase will likely motivate companies to maintain focus on resilience.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nSupply chain strategies to account for rising costs\nTo help reduce exposure to global disruptions and both maintain and boost margins, some manufacturers are looking to be strategic in their supply base restructuring by identifying and targeting specific components of a broader cost equation. Leading companies are exploring ways in which they can balance workforce requirements with labor costs and delivery times with shipping costs, all while ensuring the highest product quality.\nCompanies are still likely to heavily lean into labor costs as their main motivation for cost-based restructuring. This, of course, is not a new trend. In 1982, on average, US multinationals had 30% of their workforce abroad. Over the last several decades, companies have generally seen this percentage increase.14\nIn 2003, a Chinese employee in manufacturing made approximately 3% of their American counterpart while a Mexican employee made approximately 11%.15 As time progressed, Chinese manufacturing expertise increased and so too did accompanying wage rates. Between 2022 and 2023, a wage rate comparison reveals that a Chinese manufacturing worker makes the equivalent of approximately 26% of their American counterpart, while a Mexican worker makes approximately 14%.16 Today, workers in Malaysia and Thailand make approximately 1% and 15% of US hourly wages, respectively, and workers in India earn approximately 4-5% of US hourly wages.17\nThe inputs to the labor equation for companies have changed and so too have their supply chain practices. For instance, Mexico is currently proving to be a viable competitor to China as costs and trade policies are driving a growth of nearshoring for automotive and electronics manufacturers.18\nSome companies are taking a methodical approach to capitalizing on labor cost advantages by gradually restructuring their bases. In such a scenario, these companies can achieve labor cost efficiencies while adding resilience to their supply base through expansion.\nMany of the current cost-motivating factors are interesting from a labor arbitrage perspective. As the modern world of smart factories grows and expands, the role of labor costs will likely diminish as the entire cost equation changes. As organizations continue to incorporate automation and leverage sustainable technologies, they are likely to begin reconsidering the motivating factors for supply chain restructuring.\nFinally, the most recent supply chain disruptions have spotlighted the costs associated with shipping and logistics. As of February 1, 2024, the rate for shipping from China to the East Coast of the United States was US$6,589 forty-foot equivalent unit, a 193% rate increase since October 2023.19 Additionally, these disruptions are likely to have ripple effects down the road. The NAM manufacturers\u2019 outlook survey for the first quarter of 2024 indicated that raw material prices may increase by 2.38% over the next 12 months.20\nThe growing importance of industrial policy for profitable growth\nAmid the exposure to increased delivery times, differing labor costs, and higher transportation costs, many companies are already shaping their restructuring approaches to take advantage of evolving industrial policy. Governments across the globe are actively adapting policy to favor domestic industrial activity and consequently incentivizing reshoring and nearshoring activities. These industrial policies are likely to continue to accelerate changes in supply chains21 and could play a major role in driving decisions regarding restructuring in the coming years.\nPrivate fixed investment in manufacturing increased nearly 2.5 times in 2023 from 2021, to reach US$799.2 billion.22 As of September 2023, US$430 billion of this investment spike is attributed to several key pieces of US legislation\u2014specifically, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).23\nIn January 2024, the US Department of Defense unveiled its National Defense Industrial Strategy. One priority of this strategy is the development of resilient supply chains enabling the nation to securely acquire products, services, and technologies for defense applications. Such government strategies can facilitate the restructuring of supply chains to meet both current and future needs at speed, scale, and cost.24\nIn fact, according to data from the Reshoring Initiative 1H 2023 Report, the top reason companies reshore or conduct foreign direct investment (FDI) is government incentives.25 From free trade agreements and tariffs to tax incentives and subsidies, the United States and a host of other countries are putting policy in place to entice companies and ensure the growth of domestic regional supply chains.\nEconomic data indicates that free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement), are likely driving greater regionalization of supply chains as there are increased incentives for sourcing goods and materials in North America.\nSince USMCA\u2019s origination in 2020, FDI into North America has grown 134% to approximately US$219 billion.26 FDI in Mexico landed at nearly US$19 billion in the first quarter of 2023,\u00a0a 48% year-over-year increase.27 Of this investment, 53% was in the manufacturing sector (compared to 24% in the first quarter of 2022),28 which emerged as one of the top two industries for direct investment in both the United States and USMCA.29 Nearly half of the total FDI was led by North American companies from automotive, aerospace, electronics, and telecommunications.30\nInclusive of Mexico and Canada, the United States has free trade agreements with a total of 20 countries.31 These agreements are intended to provide opportunities for global industrial manufacturing and construction companies to benefit from reduced tariffs\u00a0on an array of goods and strengthen supply chains on the most critical items.32\nFor example, with the US-Japan Trade Agreement and the more recent agreement on strengthening critical mineral supply chains, the United States is encouraging companies to restructure their supply bases into Japan. These agreements provide companies access to more favorable tariffs for industrial goods such as machine tools and steam turbines and better access to tax incentives for mineral-based technologies.33\nFinally, governments may use tariffs as a lever to help encourage diversification away from certain markets, thereby driving restructuring activity. In combination with free trade agreements like the USMCA, these tariffs have likely led to global supply chain restructuring and new trade activity. Three years following the enactment of the USMCA, the total value of North American trade in 2023 had grown by nearly US$500 billion.34 At that point, North American trade exceeded US$1.57 trillion, placing Mexico and Canada as the top trade partners with the United States.35\nThe US government is incentivizing businesses across the industrial manufacturing and construction sector to reshore their most advanced operations with a number of tax and investment opportunities. Many of these incentives fall under bolstering critical minerals, green energy technologies, and advanced manufacturing.\nThe IRA, a US$370 billion investment program, demonstrates the US government\u2019s commitment to domestically advance clean technology manufacturing, ranging from clean energy and clean vehicles to sustainable construction materials and advanced manufacturing.36 This includes US$2.1 billion for the US General Services Administration to use materials and products with low embodied carbon37 and an advanced manufacturing tax credit to incentivize domestic production of solar and wind energy components, qualified battery components, and up to 50 critical minerals.38\nThe IRA opportunities range from direct funding to tax credits. These opportunities are attracting new investments in the United States. For example, in February 2023, Holcim Limited, used a US$1.29 billion purchase of a US roofing system company to expand its presence the United States.39\nSeparately, with the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, the US government committed US$52.7 billion of investments into domestic chip production and advanced semiconductor research and development.40 The legislation further incentivizes a push for companies in advanced manufacturing for semiconductor technology through a 25% tax credit on eligible capital investments.41\nThe impact in developing a domestic semiconductor supply chain was immediate as a number of chipmakers, including foreign companies, are building fabrication facilities. Leveraging incentives from the CHIPS Act, America\u2019s Intel Corporation announced plans to spend US$20 billion to build two fabrication plants in Ohio.42 Additionally, a Taiwanese chipmaker is building two fabrication plants in the United States43 in a move that not only enables greater access to customers but can also help de-risk supply chain operations.\nBeyond the United States, both Japan and India are using their own governments\u2019 subsidies to incentivize regional production of semiconductors. And much like in the United States, these incentives are resulting in investments.\nIn Japan, a major chipmaker is using significant subsidies from the Japanese government to help build two semiconductor fabrication plants.44 Further, a Taiwan-based foundry, in collaboration with a leading precision and electronics manufacturer from India, is utilizing Indian subsidies of approximately US$15 billion to expand its semiconductor fabrication. This expansion aims to satisfy local demand in India and build supply chain resilience for global end users.45\nCompanies deploy differentiated strategies to help achieve supply performance\nMany global industrial manufacturing and construction companies spent years employing resilience strategies like overbuying to help reduce production delays, often to the detriment of margins. Now they are employing everything from traditional strategies to advanced technologies in a quest to realize value in their supply chains.\nWhile many of these strategies are not new, recent external supply chain risks have made them a primary focus for industrial manufacturing and construction companies. These strategies can help ensure business continuity by reducing bottlenecks, balancing cost opportunities with innovation potential, and allowing access to the most favorable regulatory environments.\nTechniques to diversify sources and reduce concentration issue\nIndustrial manufacturing companies are using dual sourcing, or \u201csupplier + 1,\u201d to reduce their supply chain reliance on a single supplier or country. This is achieved by incorporating an additional supplier from the same or a different location to satisfy a portion of the supply requirement. According to a Gartner supply chain survey, 57% of industrial manufacturers with operations in China are considering the \u201csupplier + 1\u201d strategy.46\nIn some instances, companies are working to achieve extensive risk mitigation and diversification by employing a multi-sourcing strategy, where they employ three or more suppliers to satisfy a supply requirement. (To see how multi-sourcing is helping shape the advanced air mobility industry, see sidebar, \u201cEmerging industries have an opportunity to build resilient supply chains from scratch.\u201d)\nEmerging industries have an opportunity to build resilient supply chains from scratch\nEvolving industries like advanced air mobility have an opportunity to both develop and shape resilient, robust, and efficient supply chains of the future. Learning from electric vehicle industry experiences, Lilium, an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) manufacturer, is mitigating risks associated with battery production by adopting a multi-sourcing strategy.47\nFurther, Archer, another eVTOL manufacturer, has signed a Space Act Agreement with NASA to study high-performance battery cells for advanced air mobility and space applications. Archer anticipates that this study will drive progress in the evolving supply chain for electric aircraft.48\nTo mitigate the risks associated with quality and lead time, industrial manufacturing companies are gradually building capacity at new supplier locations while reducing capacity from an existing supplier. These approaches can help address business continuity challenges during uncertain times and diversify away from existing dependencies. Such measures can also enhance the overall capabilities of the particular destination country, setting the stage for future operations opportunities. Additionally, these strategies may provide companies greater access to end users or governmental incentives.\nA trifecta of restructuring options\nIn addition to expanding their supply bases through dual-or multi-sourcing strategies, industrial manufacturing companies are employing mergers and acquisitions (M&A), strategic partnerships, and new supplier investment agreements, and expanded internal capabilities to restructure and build resilience into their supply chains.\nHorizontal integration, by merging or acquiring other companies, can help companies expand their supply base as well as their customer base, while gaining access to new markets, increasing their market share, and potentially benefiting from economies of scale.\nVertical integration can be useful when manufacturers seek greater control of certain stages of the supply chain, from sourcing raw materials to delivering the final product or after-sales services. For instance, at the end of 2022, First Aviation Services Inc. acquired Associated Aircraft Manufacturing & Sales, Inc. (AAMSI). This move provided First Aviation the ability to access and integrate AAMSI\u2019s machining and electronics manufacturing operations into its supply chain.49 In the global market, AERO Vodochody AEROSPACE a.s. has bought one of the major suppliers of its new L-39NG aircraft, Technometra \u010cesk\u00fd Brod a.s.50\nAs M&A is typically capital intensive, some companies are exploring strategic partnerships and supplier investments to expand their supply bases. Strategic partnerships with new suppliers can facilitate shared strengths, mitigate risks, and are often accompanied by cost reductions and increased innovation. To ensure supply chain resilience, manufacturers may further invest in the growth and development of their suppliers. This investment can be in the form of technology transfers or financial investments.\nNew supplier investment agreements can mitigate risks with existing suppliers by enhancing internal capabilities and flexibility. These agreements can enable companies to address material flow and business continuity more readily.\u00a0(For considerations in the construction industry, see sidebar, \u201cThe construction industry may be able to emphasize collaboration and digital technologies to address supply chain issues.\u201d)\nThe construction industry may be able to emphasize collaboration and digital technologies to address supply chain issues\nConstruction input prices increased by 1.4% in February 2024, 0.4% in March 2024, and 0.5% in April 2024, with overall construction costs remaining approximately 2.3% higher than the previous year, primarily due to persistent inflation, energy costs, and escalating supply chain issues. Further, as of April 2024, the prices of crude petroleum, unprocessed energy materials, iron and steel, fabricated structural metal products, and steel mill products have surged by more than 50% compared to February 2020.51\nMoving forward, construction companies can collaborate closely with suppliers to understand risks well in advance, seek alternative sourcing options, and implement digital technologies. In the short term, some construction companies (particularly global companies) are considering local vendors for sourcing options. Additionally, while typically project-specific and not a historical trend, construction firms may purchase supplies across projects to unlock more competitive pricing by sourcing common materials from a smaller, consolidated supply base.\nImplementing digital supply chain technologies can allow construction companies to connect with suppliers in real time and can provide greater visibility and control over the supply chain by streamlining internal processes and improving overall efficiency. These proactive approaches can potentially address downtime during disruptions and manage lead time, finances, and customer confidence.\nFinally, industrial manufacturing companies are, in a sense, expanding their supply base by making substantial investments in their own capabilities. On the one hand, companies are adding new manufacturing sites or capacity to meet potential demand. On the other, they are enhancing their product capabilities and demand responsiveness by investing in new equipment and technologies, including advanced machinery such as 3D printers and specialized machines.\nEnhancing product capabilities goes beyond hardware as companies are introducing an array of software solutions. Industrial manufacturers are using technologies and digital solutions to enhance operational and supply chain resilience and increase visibility across the value chain.\nManufacturers are building digital twins of the supply chain for essential components, which can assist in identifying alternative suppliers or boosting robustness and agility to reduce dependency. As supply chains restructure, manufacturers are likely to find digitalization critical to help ensure visibility throughout supplier tiers. Deloitte\u2019s 2023 \u201cExploring the industrial metaverse\u201d revealed that 21% of those companies surveyed are incorporating metaverse technologies to improve their supply chain ecosystems.52\nDiving into specific technological applications, a study conducted by Augury revealed that supply chain management and optimization is the top use case for artificial intelligence, as reported by 41% of surveyed respondents.53 Further, the 2024 Material Handling Industry Annual Industry Report showed that respondents identified logistics, shipping and transportation, supplier selection and due diligence, and inventory management as the top three applications of AI.54\nThe modernization of existing facilities, incorporation of advanced technologies (both hardware and software), and support for suppliers to meet current demand are strategic moves that can help strengthen the supply chain for manufacturers and suppliers. (For thoughts on the aerospace and defense industry, see sidebar, \u201cThe aerospace and defense industry may further embrace agile supply chains digital technologies to meet projected demand increase.\u201d)\nThe aerospace and defense industry may further embrace agile supply chains digital technologies to meet projected demand increase\nThe aerospace industry faced significant challenges in meeting post-pandemic demand due to supply chain disruptions. Suppliers may need to be more agile moving forward to capture demand and may consider investing in emerging technologies and smart factory solutions to address supply chain challenges and optimize production capacity.\nInvesting in digital technologies can also provide greater supply chain visibility, foster innovation, and strengthen stakeholder relationships. These investments could improve efficiency and competitiveness, ultimately leading to cost and operational benefits.\nThe next phase of supply chains: Maximizing resilience while maintaining margins\nThe restructuring of the industrial manufacturing supply base reflects the sector\u2019s resilience and adaptability, particularly in the face of external uncertainties. Companies across the sector are continuously seeking opportunities to maximize resilience while keeping margins high. They are finding motivations for restructuring through delivery performance, cost reductions, and government incentives, all aimed at profitable growth.\nAs technology continues to advance, industrial manufacturing and construction companies are maintaining one eye on the future while working to ensure their supply systems of the past. Many new government policies are incentivizing advanced technology or products for future demand. However, these companies should maintain their procurement processes for legacy items. To do this, industrial manufacturing and construction companies are leveraging a multitude of strategies, ranging from diversifying their suppliers and seeking new agreements to bringing capabilities in-house and implementing digital technologies, all in an effort to help create resilient and efficient supply chains.\nChange your Analytics and performance cookie settings\nto access this feature.\nBY\nJim Kilpatrick\nCanadian Consumer Products Industry Leader\nCanada\nJim is the Global Supply Chain & Network Operations Leader for Deloitte Consulting, and the leader for Consumer Products Industry in Canada.

      "Factory Ordering a Car? These Are Wait Times We\u2019re Seeing in 2024\nFactory Ordering a Car? These Are Wait Times We\u2019re Seeing in 2024\nWhat vehicle are you interested in?\nWhat's your zip code?\nWe track new car inventory monthly, and it\u2019s been encouraging to see automakers like Ford and Toyota having more cars shipped to dealers. Still, automakers are selling every car they can make. With that said, more drivers are placing factory orders for vehicle builds that might not arrive until well into next year, or worse. Here\u2019s how long car buyers are waiting for the vehicle they want.\nImportant note: These times are strictly for factory ordered cars. Many of these models are now available on dealer lots.\nKia and Hyundai Wait Times\nHyundai Motors owns 51% of Kia, and the two Korean automakers have grown increasingly close over the past decade. Today, many of their vehicles share components, and therefore have been similarly impacted by supply chain constraints.\nThese are the factory order wait times our team of Car Coaches is hearing in 2024:\nSubaru Wait Times\nRight now, buyers placing orders for a Subaru are regularly being told that the wait time for delivery will be between one and four months, and in some cases longer. Subaru was hit hard by the chip shortage, and has yet to pull out of the slump. These are the Subaru factory wait times we\u2019re hearing today:\nToyota Factory Order Wait Times\nHow long you should expect to wait depends on the Toyota model and spec that you\u2019ve ordered. For Toyota hybrids and plug-in hybrids, wait times are much longer. For the Toyota RAV4 Prime and Prius Prime, wait times are longest.\nIn 2024, these are common Toyota factory order wait times our team is hearing:\n4Runner: 2-4 monthsGR86: 5-8 monthsCamry: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsCorolla: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsHighlander: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsPrius: 4-6 months / Prime 8+ monthsRAV4: 2-4 months / Hybrid or Prime 8+ monthsSequoia: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsSienna: 2-5 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsTacoma: 2-4 monthsTundra: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsVenza: 2-4 months\nHonda Wait Times\nOn average, Honda factory orders placed today can expect a four month wait before delivery. For the popular, newly redesigned Civic, the wait is more likely to be six months. Honda has been hit particularly hard by the chip shortage and pandemic-related disruptions. Japanese automakers were even dealt a blow from an earthquake earlier this year.\nThese are the Honda factory order wait times we\u2019re seeing in 2024:\nAccord: ImmediateCivic: 1-2 monthsCR-V: 1-2 monthsCR-V Hybrid: 3+ monthsOdyssey: 2-4 monthsPilot: 1-2 monthsRidgeline: Immediate\nIn 2024, the Honda Prologue electric crossover will arrive. Pre-orders are expected to open soon, so keep an eye out for that if you want to be first on the list for this GM-built Honda EV. It will qualify for at least half of the new EV tax credit.\nSee which new electric vehicles qualify for the new EV tax credit\nRam and Jeep Wait Times\nFor Jeep and Ram factory orders, wait times depend on what model and trim you want. Waiting three to four months for a Ram 1500 or Jeep Grand Cherokee is a lot easier to swallow if you\u2019re getting a better deal with incentives.\nThese are the Ram truck factory wait times our team is encountering in 2024:\n1500: 1-3 months2500: 2-4 months3500: 2-4 months\nFord Factory Orders Wait Times Faring Slightly Better\nThese are the Ford factory order wait times we\u2019re seeing this year:\nBronco: 3+ monthsBronco Sport: 1-3 monthsF-150: 1-3 monthsF-250: 2-3 monthsF-350: 2-3 monthsF-450: 2-6 monthsMustang: ImmediateMustang Mach E: 1-3 months\nHybrids, Plug-In Hybrids and EVs Have the Longest Wait Times\nWe\u2019re seeing wait times for popular hybrid vehicles extending up to one year for several automakers. It\u2019s easy to forget that gas prices were over $5.00/gallon nationally just a few months ago, and that caused a massive spike in orders for more fuel-efficient vehicles.\nNot only is demand higher, but OEMs are rationing their supplies of semiconductor chips and in some cases, even batteries.\nIn a silver lining to the confusing new EV tax credit, America will soon have its first used EV tax credit. The used EV tax credit began in January 2023, but only used EVs under $25,000 will qualify (if sold by a dealer, and the buyer meets income restrictions.) Learn more about the used EV tax credit and eligibility here.\nTesla Wait Times\nTesla regularly updates wait times for the Model Y, Model 3, Model S and Model X. As of 2024, here are Tesla wait times as shared on Tesla.com. Note that there are many possible configurations that affect estimated delivery dates, so check Tesla\u2019s configurator for the most accurate estimate.\nTaking Delivery After a Long Wait? Beware of the Infamous Dirt Mountain\nAlthough Ford has somewhat improved factory order wait times in recent months, customers are still taking delivery of Broncos that had spent months waiting around at the so-called Dirt Mountain in Michigan. How could that impact those taking delivery of their beloved Ford Bronco? Field mice.\nAnytime vehicles sit idly for months at a time, there\u2019s the risk of rodents making the car their home. Before taking delivery, have all wires under the hood checked for signs of gnawing rodents. Ford even admitted in their earnings report that their number one challenge right now is quality control, and the infamous Dirt Mountain issues are certainly part of that. Of course these new vehicles are under warranty, but you\u2019d hate to be left stranded with power failure shortly after driving your new car home.\nGet the most when you sell your car.\nFree Car Buying Help Is Here!\nReady to outsmart the dealerships?

Based on current market conditions and trends (which may be quite different in January as used car prices begin to fall), I expect PHEV and full BEV prices to remain elevated while used ICE vehicles fall. With a price cap of $25k built into the used EV and PHEV tax credit, expect to see a lot of used, older PHEVs and EVs for $24,900.\nI ordered a Ford Expedition in March, it\u2019s still not even built. My friend ordered a Dodge Charger in August, it was built last week and is in transit for delivery. How can Ford be running 8 MONTHS slower than Dodge??? What the heck are they doing over there at Ford?\nWe just ordered a 2023 Ford Escape Platinum Hybrid FWD.\nThe dealer quoted us a wait of just 8-10 weeks.\nWe\u2019ll see how it goes.\nI called the marketing department to see if they have any photos available, as the ordering process still shows the 2022 model.\nAll I\u2019ve seen so far is spy videos on YouTube.\nIf you have any other ideas on how to find what it actually looks like, I\u2019d be thankful.\nThanks for sharing! Not sure what it looks like, but I think it\u2019s a good choice. Get the agreed price in writing from the sales manager!\nRegarding Ford Wait Times: I\u2019m not sure that 4-6 months is accurate. I ordered a Bronco on 22 December 2021 and my vehicle started production recently on 11 October 2022. With final assembly and then delivery to my dealer, I\u2019m looking at about 11 months wait time in total. In my production week alone, 44 fellow Bronco have self-reported wait times from 200-400 days since they ordered their Bronco\u2019s. While Ford does seem to be working hard to complete Manufacturing Year (MY) 22 builds, we are far from 4-6 weeks away f wait time.\nThanks for sharing! Our estimate is for new factory orders placed today. It will vary from model to model, but this is our estimate from the information we\u2019ve gathered from recent buyers placing orders.\nI think the estimate for US Subaru factory orders are way off. I placed an order for an Outback at the beginning of August and have just learned that it has reached the first point in the US. It means it has just been built and might be at the railyards for shipping to the westcoast\nof Canada. Might get by end of Jan. 2024. So possibly 6 months wait. I understand from the dealer that it is similar for other models built in the US.\nSubmit a Comment Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

To enhance supply chain resilience, it\u2019s critical for companies to understand and have visibility over the most frequent and severe problems that can impact a supplier\u2019s ability to provide the goods and service the business needs. These challenges include:\nHere\u2019s a closer look at each of these concerns and the supply chain risk management strategies that can help to mitigate disruption.\nAs risks become more complicated and interconnected, supply chain professionals must identify and address top challenges to ensure resilience. Today, among the top supply chain risks are:\n#1: Poor Supplier Performance\nSupplier performance holds a huge potential for supply chain disruption.\nA supplier\u2019s financial health is often a reliable predictor of their performance. However, other factors should be considered when assessing both the internal and extraneous factors that may impact their performance, including:\nMitigation Strategies\nThe most important way to protect your company against this potential risk is to use predictive analytics to identify a supplier\u2019s declining financial health before it impacts yours. It\u2019s also important to maintain relationships with alternative suppliers, ideally in other parts of the world, to diversify and potentially reduce environmental risk. Finally, companies should invest in inventory management techniques and keep buffer stocks on hand to prevent delays in case of supplier performance issues.\n#2: Demand Planning Complexity\nDuring the pandemic, demand patterns changed as people were confined to their homes. Planning for pent-up demand was easier when companies operated on a just-in-time basis. Now, however, companies need to buy more than they need immediately \u2014 but they may not know exactly how much more.\nMitigation Strategies\nInvesting in more sophisticated demand planning solutions that move away from traditional algorithms tied to historical demand patterns to those that focus on predictive analytics and other advanced methodologies.\nAs this may be a longer-term strategy based on significant investments required, there are also some practical, short term areas that can create big improvements such as:\nReviewing vendor set up logic and accuracy\nAdjusting safety stock levels with a more granular application towards strategic and under-performing supplier and focusing on lead time monitoring and more frequent updates to system settings\n#3: Global Labor Shortage\nIncreased competition for skilled labor means that companies might not have the resources to build a product or deliver a service in time. Additionally, they might struggle to find the skills needed to effectively assess, monitor, and mitigate supplier risk.\nMitigation Strategies\nUnderstand labor shortage patterns and how they relate to global supply chain risk. From there, it\u2019s easier to identify and address workforce problems, implement solutions like retraining, or adjust hiring practices.\n#4: Rising Inflation\nHigh inflation creates unpredictable price increases, making it more difficult to effectively plan and manage cashflows. It also causes complications and delays when negotiating prices with suppliers.\nMitigation Strategies\nDiversify supplier relationships to help distribute rising costs away from your own operations. It\u2019s also critical to understand potential disruptions to your finances and plan accordingly.\n#5: A Volatile Global Economy\nPost-pandemic economic uncertainty has led many to fear a global recession. Companies used to increase inventories to ensure steady production \u2014 but if the market contracts, companies might have unsold inventories at the peak of production cycles.\nMitigation Strategies\nDo what you can to understand the global supply chain as a whole and how suppliers in different areas impact (and are impacted by) economic conditions. Focus on managing the financial risks you have direct control over so you\u2019re protected in case of other disruptions.\n#6: Complex Sanctions and Regulations\nEven before 2023, new sanctions were being imposed every day. Keeping up with sanctions is challenging: Firms must know suppliers\u2019 ultimate beneficial owners, directors, and shareholders to comply and prevent bad actors from undermining their supply chain.\nMitigation Strategies\nView supply chain risk management through a regulatory lens. Understand requirements, expectations, and penalties relevant to your industry, and take timely action to update relationships or choose alternate suppliers if necessary.\n#7: Geopolitical Risk\nOngoing global political events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and China\u2019s zero-Covid policy have heavily disrupted global supply chains. As conditions and relationships grow more complicated, the entire supply chain will shift to keep up.\nMitigation Strategies\nFirms need both onshore and offshore alternative suppliers to ensure they have options in case of disruption. Analyze the costs and benefits of these sites to understand the domestic and international affairs where potential suppliers are based.\n#8: Reputational Risk\nThis can result from many risk factors. One such driver can be unsatisfactory environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related practices among suppliers \u2013 including poor working conditions and labor relations.\nMitigation Strategies\nCompanies can begin by understanding possible incidents through audits and reputational monitoring. Use this information to consider external risks and their potential impact on your overall supply chain. Then, decide how to mitigate any risk areas identified \u2013 by engaging with suppliers directly or, in severe cases or where resolutions cannot be found, by switching suppliers.\n#9: Natural Disasters and Climate Risk\nSupply chains are vulnerable to property damage and business interruption due to natural disasters, but they also present opportunities to meet sustainability targets. Firms need to quantify the financial and operational impact in real time and assess site-specific risks.\nMitigation Strategies\nUse climate data to assess how a supplier\u2019s activities and the location of its facilities expose you to risk. As you learn more about your partnerships, base inventory planning decisions on areas or suppliers with the highest risk potential.\n#10: Cyber Risk\nThe increased threat of cyberattacks has made paramount companies\u2019 understanding of both their own cybersecurity protocols and those of their suppliers. Any organization with access to the company\u2019s network or systems can pose a risk.\nMitigation Strategies\nStart by reviewing system access, information sharing permissions, and the extent of the information being shared. Analyze any and all data sharing habits with suppliers that can present challenges, if managed incorrectly.\nUnderstanding Supply Chain Risk\nAlthough it\u2019s helpful to understand the top supply chain risks in any given year, it\u2019s far more important to know the underlying causes, relationships, effects, and explanations. Even as individual factors shift and impacts take different forms, these foundational principles are always relevant \u2014 and always useful in supply chain management.\nCauses\nThe specific causes of supply chain risk may change, but they tend to align with patterns. For example, failure to follow or update certain procedures can lead to ESG, reputational, cyber, and other risks; poor global relationships can complicate geopolitical, economic, and sustainability risks; even well-meaning human error can cause cascading effects. It\u2019s important to understand these patterns and their underlying logic so you can identify them in different forms.\nRelationships\nIt\u2019s often difficult to separate one kind of risk from another because today\u2019s interconnected supply chains don\u2019t lend themselves to neat compartmentalization. This can complicate risk management \u2014 but also empower it. When supply chain leaders are called to treat risks more holistically, it\u2019s easier to identify and capitalize on these logical relationships, ensuring that fewer issues are overlooked or unaddressed.\nEffects\nThe effects of supply chain disruption can shift depending on the market, industry, and type of risk \u2014 but nonetheless, they can generally be sorted into the same categories:\nDelays: Even small supply chain challenges can cause delays that impact workflows, projects, budgets, and outcomes down the line.\nShortages: When a supplier has performance or timing issues, they can cause shortages of raw material and specific products, which impacts availability in the wider market.\nPrice disruption: Shortages often lead to increased costs for everyone in the supply chain, even end consumers.\nLoss of reputation: Whether it\u2019s a small, internal supply chain risk or a public ESG failure, the effects of disruption can lead to reputational impacts that may not be easy to remedy.\nPrioritization\nWhile individual risks and their effects might shift, it\u2019s always critical to have a plan. Often, this means relying on a prioritization framework \u2014 a flexible but well-defined approach to supply chain challenges that helps you analyze potential outcomes and address problems accordingly. This approach should be customized based on the risk types that are most impactful to your organization\u2019s performance and objectives; these values may change over time, but should always relate to specific risk management goals.\nEqually important is the understanding that not all participants of a supply chain or industry have the same risk appetite or priorities. This means two things: First, you needn\u2019t base your approach on your peers\u2019; and second, you may find that your needs conflict with those of a particular supply chain partner, which may cause friction. When you\u2019re aware of this possibility, you can take steps to mitigate delays or disruptions without compromising your own needs.\nLearn More About Supply Chain Risks and Solutions\nAs global economies and supply chains become more complex, so do the risks that impact them.

For many industrial manufacturers, the response of the supply network to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical challenges, and natural disasters thrust supply chain resilience into the limelight. But the pendulum appears to be swinging back, with costs and margin pressures once again at the forefront as companies reevaluate their supply chains.\nAs of early 2024, supply chain pressures have fallen from the unprecedented levels following the COVID-19 pandemic.1 The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Manufacturers\u2019 Outlook Survey for fourth quarter of 2023 revealed that, in the last two years, 86.2% of respondents have worked to de-risk their supply chains.2 Many companies are now prioritizing a resilient yet efficient supply chain. They are working to optimize the balance between performance and cost by restructuring their supply chain. These approaches include expanding to locations in the United States, or to locations closer to end consumers, and also working more closely with free trade partners of the United States.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nIndustrial manufacturers are finding advantages in countries across North America and Asia. They are exploring both \u201cnearshoring\u201d options in Canada and Mexico and \u201creshoring\u201d options in the United States. The share of US trade in goods with China has declined from 21.2% in 2018 to 13.9% in 2023. While Mexico has overtaken China to become the lead US trading partner, accounting for a 15.4% share (figure 1), Mexican trade with China has simultaneously increased.3 Now, manufacturers are likely exploring ways to ensure that their Tier 2 and Tier 3 supply networks are sufficiently networked to reduce their raw material and key component exposure.\nOther nearshoring options such as Canada, as well as potential Asian trading partners like India, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, have experienced growth. This restructuring is occurring globally and is not exclusive to the United States, nor is it a North American phenomenon. In fact, at the end of 2023, 97% of companies surveyed in the Economist Impact\u2019s \u201cTrade in Transition 2024\u201d project stated they were reconfiguring their supply chains in some way, as compared to 92% in 2022.4\nThese changes beg the questions: What are industrial manufacturing and construction companies considering with respect to performance and cost as they restructure their supply chains? And how are they doing the restructuring?\nShare image\nOr copy link\nSupply chain efficiency is motivating industrial manufacturers to restructure their supply base\nAs global supply chains have normalized\u00a0following the pandemic, chief executive officers are likely beginning to shift their strategic focus toward profitable growth.5 Part of the strategy for many, for maintaining healthy margins, is rooted in reducing company exposure to supply chain disruption while employing cost reduction techniques and capitalizing on government policies supporting domestic growth.\nGeopolitical instability and disruptions keep the focus on delivery and lead times\nAs CEOs look to keep their company exposure low, their concerns over the indirect impacts of geopolitical instabilities on supply chains have grown.6 And, after a period of decline, the end of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 saw an uptick in supply chain challenges as a primary business issue for manufacturers (figure 2).7 This, in turn, has led to increased transit times worldwide.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nIndustry leaders expect that global shipping may experience up to 20-day delays in deliveries in the coming months.8 Deloitte\u2019s US economic forecast for the first quarter of 2024 suggests that the situation in the Red Sea may persist,9 potentially upending the progress made in lead times since 2022. In particular, the average lead time of production materials in April 2024 was 79 days. While this is a 21% reduction from the peak of 100 days reached in July 2022, it is still higher than 2019 levels, which averaged around 65 days (figure 3).10\nLonger lead times can threaten manufacturing processes, and ultimately business continuity, for companies across the value chain. In the face of recent disruptions, the Manufacturing Supplier Deliveries Index rose to 48.9 in April 2024 from 47 in December 2023.11 The increase in the index signals a slowdown in the delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations, largely due to raw material supply chains.12 While delivery performance showed a trend of significant improvement with average delivery decreases of 72.8 in 2021 to 57.3 in 2022 and 46 in 2023, it increased in the first quarter of 2024 to 49.7.13 This increase will likely motivate companies to maintain focus on resilience.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nSupply chain strategies to account for rising costs\nTo help reduce exposure to global disruptions and both maintain and boost margins, some manufacturers are looking to be strategic in their supply base restructuring by identifying and targeting specific components of a broader cost equation. Leading companies are exploring ways in which they can balance workforce requirements with labor costs and delivery times with shipping costs, all while ensuring the highest product quality.\nCompanies are still likely to heavily lean into labor costs as their main motivation for cost-based restructuring. This, of course, is not a new trend. In 1982, on average, US multinationals had 30% of their workforce abroad. Over the last several decades, companies have generally seen this percentage increase.14\nIn 2003, a Chinese employee in manufacturing made approximately 3% of their American counterpart while a Mexican employee made approximately 11%.15 As time progressed, Chinese manufacturing expertise increased and so too did accompanying wage rates. Between 2022 and 2023, a wage rate comparison reveals that a Chinese manufacturing worker makes the equivalent of approximately 26% of their American counterpart, while a Mexican worker makes approximately 14%.16 Today, workers in Malaysia and Thailand make approximately 1% and 15% of US hourly wages, respectively, and workers in India earn approximately 4-5% of US hourly wages.17\nThe inputs to the labor equation for companies have changed and so too have their supply chain practices. For instance, Mexico is currently proving to be a viable competitor to China as costs and trade policies are driving a growth of nearshoring for automotive and electronics manufacturers.18\nSome companies are taking a methodical approach to capitalizing on labor cost advantages by gradually restructuring their bases. In such a scenario, these companies can achieve labor cost efficiencies while adding resilience to their supply base through expansion.\nMany of the current cost-motivating factors are interesting from a labor arbitrage perspective. As the modern world of smart factories grows and expands, the role of labor costs will likely diminish as the entire cost equation changes. As organizations continue to incorporate automation and leverage sustainable technologies, they are likely to begin reconsidering the motivating factors for supply chain restructuring.\nFinally, the most recent supply chain disruptions have spotlighted the costs associated with shipping and logistics. As of February 1, 2024, the rate for shipping from China to the East Coast of the United States was US$6,589 forty-foot equivalent unit, a 193% rate increase since October 2023.19 Additionally, these disruptions are likely to have ripple effects down the road. The NAM manufacturers\u2019 outlook survey for the first quarter of 2024 indicated that raw material prices may increase by 2.38% over the next 12 months.20\nThe growing importance of industrial policy for profitable growth\nAmid the exposure to increased delivery times, differing labor costs, and higher transportation costs, many companies are already shaping their restructuring approaches to take advantage of evolving industrial policy. Governments across the globe are actively adapting policy to favor domestic industrial activity and consequently incentivizing reshoring and nearshoring activities. These industrial policies are likely to continue to accelerate changes in supply chains21 and could play a major role in driving decisions regarding restructuring in the coming years.\nPrivate fixed investment in manufacturing increased nearly 2.5 times in 2023 from 2021, to reach US$799.2 billion.22 As of September 2023, US$430 billion of this investment spike is attributed to several key pieces of US legislation\u2014specifically, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).23\nIn January 2024, the US Department of Defense unveiled its National Defense Industrial Strategy. One priority of this strategy is the development of resilient supply chains enabling the nation to securely acquire products, services, and technologies for defense applications. Such government strategies can facilitate the restructuring of supply chains to meet both current and future needs at speed, scale, and cost.24\nIn fact, according to data from the Reshoring Initiative 1H 2023 Report, the top reason companies reshore or conduct foreign direct investment (FDI) is government incentives.25 From free trade agreements and tariffs to tax incentives and subsidies, the United States and a host of other countries are putting policy in place to entice companies and ensure the growth of domestic regional supply chains.\nEconomic data indicates that free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement), are likely driving greater regionalization of supply chains as there are increased incentives for sourcing goods and materials in North America.\nSince USMCA\u2019s origination in 2020, FDI into North America has grown 134% to approximately US$219 billion.26 FDI in Mexico landed at nearly US$19 billion in the first quarter of 2023,\u00a0a 48% year-over-year increase.27 Of this investment, 53% was in the manufacturing sector (compared to 24% in the first quarter of 2022),28 which emerged as one of the top two industries for direct investment in both the United States and USMCA.29 Nearly half of the total FDI was led by North American companies from automotive, aerospace, electronics, and telecommunications.30\nInclusive of Mexico and Canada, the United States has free trade agreements with a total of 20 countries.31 These agreements are intended to provide opportunities for global industrial manufacturing and construction companies to benefit from reduced tariffs\u00a0on an array of goods and strengthen supply chains on the most critical items.32\nFor example, with the US-Japan Trade Agreement and the more recent agreement on strengthening critical mineral supply chains, the United States is encouraging companies to restructure their supply bases into Japan. These agreements provide companies access to more favorable tariffs for industrial goods such as machine tools and steam turbines and better access to tax incentives for mineral-based technologies.33\nFinally, governments may use tariffs as a lever to help encourage diversification away from certain markets, thereby driving restructuring activity. In combination with free trade agreements like the USMCA, these tariffs have likely led to global supply chain restructuring and new trade activity. Three years following the enactment of the USMCA, the total value of North American trade in 2023 had grown by nearly US$500 billion.34 At that point, North American trade exceeded US$1.57 trillion, placing Mexico and Canada as the top trade partners with the United States.35\nThe US government is incentivizing businesses across the industrial manufacturing and construction sector to reshore their most advanced operations with a number of tax and investment opportunities. Many of these incentives fall under bolstering critical minerals, green energy technologies, and advanced manufacturing.\nThe IRA, a US$370 billion investment program, demonstrates the US government\u2019s commitment to domestically advance clean technology manufacturing, ranging from clean energy and clean vehicles to sustainable construction materials and advanced manufacturing.36 This includes US$2.1 billion for the US General Services Administration to use materials and products with low embodied carbon37 and an advanced manufacturing tax credit to incentivize domestic production of solar and wind energy components, qualified battery components, and up to 50 critical minerals.38\nThe IRA opportunities range from direct funding to tax credits. These opportunities are attracting new investments in the United States. For example, in February 2023, Holcim Limited, used a US$1.29 billion purchase of a US roofing system company to expand its presence the United States.39\nSeparately, with the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, the US government committed US$52.7 billion of investments into domestic chip production and advanced semiconductor research and development.40 The legislation further incentivizes a push for companies in advanced manufacturing for semiconductor technology through a 25% tax credit on eligible capital investments.41\nThe impact in developing a domestic semiconductor supply chain was immediate as a number of chipmakers, including foreign companies, are building fabrication facilities. Leveraging incentives from the CHIPS Act, America\u2019s Intel Corporation announced plans to spend US$20 billion to build two fabrication plants in Ohio.42 Additionally, a Taiwanese chipmaker is building two fabrication plants in the United States43 in a move that not only enables greater access to customers but can also help de-risk supply chain operations.\nBeyond the United States, both Japan and India are using their own governments\u2019 subsidies to incentivize regional production of semiconductors. And much like in the United States, these incentives are resulting in investments.\nIn Japan, a major chipmaker is using significant subsidies from the Japanese government to help build two semiconductor fabrication plants.44 Further, a Taiwan-based foundry, in collaboration with a leading precision and electronics manufacturer from India, is utilizing Indian subsidies of approximately US$15 billion to expand its semiconductor fabrication. This expansion aims to satisfy local demand in India and build supply chain resilience for global end users.45\nCompanies deploy differentiated strategies to help achieve supply performance\nMany global industrial manufacturing and construction companies spent years employing resilience strategies like overbuying to help reduce production delays, often to the detriment of margins. Now they are employing everything from traditional strategies to advanced technologies in a quest to realize value in their supply chains.\nWhile many of these strategies are not new, recent external supply chain risks have made them a primary focus for industrial manufacturing and construction companies. These strategies can help ensure business continuity by reducing bottlenecks, balancing cost opportunities with innovation potential, and allowing access to the most favorable regulatory environments.\nTechniques to diversify sources and reduce concentration issue\nIndustrial manufacturing companies are using dual sourcing, or \u201csupplier + 1,\u201d to reduce their supply chain reliance on a single supplier or country. This is achieved by incorporating an additional supplier from the same or a different location to satisfy a portion of the supply requirement. According to a Gartner supply chain survey, 57% of industrial manufacturers with operations in China are considering the \u201csupplier + 1\u201d strategy.46\nIn some instances, companies are working to achieve extensive risk mitigation and diversification by employing a multi-sourcing strategy, where they employ three or more suppliers to satisfy a supply requirement. (To see how multi-sourcing is helping shape the advanced air mobility industry, see sidebar, \u201cEmerging industries have an opportunity to build resilient supply chains from scratch.\u201d)\nEmerging industries have an opportunity to build resilient supply chains from scratch\nEvolving industries like advanced air mobility have an opportunity to both develop and shape resilient, robust, and efficient supply chains of the future. Learning from electric vehicle industry experiences, Lilium, an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) manufacturer, is mitigating risks associated with battery production by adopting a multi-sourcing strategy.47\nFurther, Archer, another eVTOL manufacturer, has signed a Space Act Agreement with NASA to study high-performance battery cells for advanced air mobility and space applications. Archer anticipates that this study will drive progress in the evolving supply chain for electric aircraft.48\nTo mitigate the risks associated with quality and lead time, industrial manufacturing companies are gradually building capacity at new supplier locations while reducing capacity from an existing supplier. These approaches can help address business continuity challenges during uncertain times and diversify away from existing dependencies. Such measures can also enhance the overall capabilities of the particular destination country, setting the stage for future operations opportunities. Additionally, these strategies may provide companies greater access to end users or governmental incentives.\nA trifecta of restructuring options\nIn addition to expanding their supply bases through dual-or multi-sourcing strategies, industrial manufacturing companies are employing mergers and acquisitions (M&A), strategic partnerships, and new supplier investment agreements, and expanded internal capabilities to restructure and build resilience into their supply chains.\nHorizontal integration, by merging or acquiring other companies, can help companies expand their supply base as well as their customer base, while gaining access to new markets, increasing their market share, and potentially benefiting from economies of scale.\nVertical integration can be useful when manufacturers seek greater control of certain stages of the supply chain, from sourcing raw materials to delivering the final product or after-sales services. For instance, at the end of 2022, First Aviation Services Inc. acquired Associated Aircraft Manufacturing & Sales, Inc. (AAMSI). This move provided First Aviation the ability to access and integrate AAMSI\u2019s machining and electronics manufacturing operations into its supply chain.49 In the global market, AERO Vodochody AEROSPACE a.s. has bought one of the major suppliers of its new L-39NG aircraft, Technometra \u010cesk\u00fd Brod a.s.50\nAs M&A is typically capital intensive, some companies are exploring strategic partnerships and supplier investments to expand their supply bases. Strategic partnerships with new suppliers can facilitate shared strengths, mitigate risks, and are often accompanied by cost reductions and increased innovation. To ensure supply chain resilience, manufacturers may further invest in the growth and development of their suppliers. This investment can be in the form of technology transfers or financial investments.\nNew supplier investment agreements can mitigate risks with existing suppliers by enhancing internal capabilities and flexibility. These agreements can enable companies to address material flow and business continuity more readily.\u00a0(For considerations in the construction industry, see sidebar, \u201cThe construction industry may be able to emphasize collaboration and digital technologies to address supply chain issues.\u201d)\nThe construction industry may be able to emphasize collaboration and digital technologies to address supply chain issues\nConstruction input prices increased by 1.4% in February 2024, 0.4% in March 2024, and 0.5% in April 2024, with overall construction costs remaining approximately 2.3% higher than the previous year, primarily due to persistent inflation, energy costs, and escalating supply chain issues. Further, as of April 2024, the prices of crude petroleum, unprocessed energy materials, iron and steel, fabricated structural metal products, and steel mill products have surged by more than 50% compared to February 2020.51\nMoving forward, construction companies can collaborate closely with suppliers to understand risks well in advance, seek alternative sourcing options, and implement digital technologies. In the short term, some construction companies (particularly global companies) are considering local vendors for sourcing options. Additionally, while typically project-specific and not a historical trend, construction firms may purchase supplies across projects to unlock more competitive pricing by sourcing common materials from a smaller, consolidated supply base.\nImplementing digital supply chain technologies can allow construction companies to connect with suppliers in real time and can provide greater visibility and control over the supply chain by streamlining internal processes and improving overall efficiency. These proactive approaches can potentially address downtime during disruptions and manage lead time, finances, and customer confidence.\nFinally, industrial manufacturing companies are, in a sense, expanding their supply base by making substantial investments in their own capabilities. On the one hand, companies are adding new manufacturing sites or capacity to meet potential demand. On the other, they are enhancing their product capabilities and demand responsiveness by investing in new equipment and technologies, including advanced machinery such as 3D printers and specialized machines.\nEnhancing product capabilities goes beyond hardware as companies are introducing an array of software solutions. Industrial manufacturers are using technologies and digital solutions to enhance operational and supply chain resilience and increase visibility across the value chain.\nManufacturers are building digital twins of the supply chain for essential components, which can assist in identifying alternative suppliers or boosting robustness and agility to reduce dependency. As supply chains restructure, manufacturers are likely to find digitalization critical to help ensure visibility throughout supplier tiers. Deloitte\u2019s 2023 \u201cExploring the industrial metaverse\u201d revealed that 21% of those companies surveyed are incorporating metaverse technologies to improve their supply chain ecosystems.52\nDiving into specific technological applications, a study conducted by Augury revealed that supply chain management and optimization is the top use case for artificial intelligence, as reported by 41% of surveyed respondents.53 Further, the 2024 Material Handling Industry Annual Industry Report showed that respondents identified logistics, shipping and transportation, supplier selection and due diligence, and inventory management as the top three applications of AI.54\nThe modernization of existing facilities, incorporation of advanced technologies (both hardware and software), and support for suppliers to meet current demand are strategic moves that can help strengthen the supply chain for manufacturers and suppliers. (For thoughts on the aerospace and defense industry, see sidebar, \u201cThe aerospace and defense industry may further embrace agile supply chains digital technologies to meet projected demand increase.\u201d)\nThe aerospace and defense industry may further embrace agile supply chains digital technologies to meet projected demand increase\nThe aerospace industry faced significant challenges in meeting post-pandemic demand due to supply chain disruptions. Suppliers may need to be more agile moving forward to capture demand and may consider investing in emerging technologies and smart factory solutions to address supply chain challenges and optimize production capacity.\nInvesting in digital technologies can also provide greater supply chain visibility, foster innovation, and strengthen stakeholder relationships. These investments could improve efficiency and competitiveness, ultimately leading to cost and operational benefits.\nThe next phase of supply chains: Maximizing resilience while maintaining margins\nThe restructuring of the industrial manufacturing supply base reflects the sector\u2019s resilience and adaptability, particularly in the face of external uncertainties. Companies across the sector are continuously seeking opportunities to maximize resilience while keeping margins high. They are finding motivations for restructuring through delivery performance, cost reductions, and government incentives, all aimed at profitable growth.\nAs technology continues to advance, industrial manufacturing and construction companies are maintaining one eye on the future while working to ensure their supply systems of the past. Many new government policies are incentivizing advanced technology or products for future demand. However, these companies should maintain their procurement processes for legacy items. To do this, industrial manufacturing and construction companies are leveraging a multitude of strategies, ranging from diversifying their suppliers and seeking new agreements to bringing capabilities in-house and implementing digital technologies, all in an effort to help create resilient and efficient supply chains.\nChange your Analytics and performance cookie settings\nto access this feature.\nBY\nJim Kilpatrick\nCanadian Consumer Products Industry Leader\nCanada\nJim is the Global Supply Chain & Network Operations Leader for Deloitte Consulting, and the leader for Consumer Products Industry in Canada.
