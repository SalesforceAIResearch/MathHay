This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) both also affect agricultural output and both also show sensitivity to climate variability and change3,4,5,6,7,8,9. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts to agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield, but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nWarming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields\n                                        \n\n\nImpacts of recent climate change on crop yield can depend on local conditions in climatically diverse regions of Norway\n                                        \n\n\nContrasting area and yield responses to extreme climate contributes to climate-resilient rice production in Asia\n                                        \n\nReferences\nRosenzweig, C. et al.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The sensitivity of agricultural output to climate change has often been estimated by modeling crop yields under climate change scenarios or with statistical analysis of the impacts of year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields. However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) also affect agricultural output and show sensitivity to climate variability and change. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency, and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses, and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts on agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.

The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4. Difference from average Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) for the state of Kansas during the February 12-26, 2024 period as compared to the long-term average. Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) both also affect agricultural output and both also show sensitivity to climate variability and change3,4,5,6,7,8,9. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts to agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield, but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nWarming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields\n                                        \n\n\nImpacts of recent climate change on crop yield can depend on local conditions in climatically diverse regions of Norway\n                                        \n\n\nContrasting area and yield responses to extreme climate contributes to climate-resilient rice production in Asia\n                                        \n\nReferences\nRosenzweig, C. et al.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The sensitivity of agricultural output to climate change has often been estimated by modeling crop yields under climate change scenarios or with statistical analysis of the impacts of year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields. However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) also affect agricultural output and show sensitivity to climate variability and change. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency, and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses, and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts on agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

Additionally, the bulletin also includes highlights regarding the boreal summer (June-July-August). Most of the reported findings are based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature highlights:\u00a0\n  \n\nGlobal Temperatures\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally (together with August 2023), with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August.\u202f\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was 1.51\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level and is the 13th month in a 14-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. *\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record for any 12-month period, at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. These values are identical to those recorded for the previous two 12-month periods, ending in June and July 2024.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.23\u00b0C warmer than the same period in 2023. The average anomaly for the remaining months of this year would need to drop by at least 0.30\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. This has never happened in the entire ERA5 dataset, making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record.\u00a0\n*Datasets other than ERA5 may not confirm the 13 months above 1.5\u00b0C highlighted here, due to the relatively small margins above 1.5\u00b0C of ERA5 global temperatures for July and August 2023 and May, June, and August 2024 and differences among the various datasets.\u00a0\nEurope and other regions\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for August 2024 was 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August, making the month the second warmest August on record for Europe after August 2022, which was 1.73\u00b0C above average.\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean temperatures were most above average over southern and eastern Europe, but below average over northwestern parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway.\u00a0\u00a0\nOutside Europe, temperatures were most above average over eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\nTemperatures were below average over far eastern Russia and Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan and the Sahel.\u00a0\nSea surface temperature\u00a0\nThe average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest value on record for the month, and only 0.07\u00b0C below August 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe equatorial Pacific had below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs across the oceans remained unusually high over many regions.\u00a0\nAccording to Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): \"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0\nMonthly year-to-date global surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for the ten warmest years on record. 2024 is shown with a red line, 2023 with a yellow line, and all other years with grey lines. Each data point shows the average anomaly from January to the corresponding month. E.g. the value for August 2024 corresponds to the average anomaly from January to August 2024. Data source: ERA5.

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site. \n\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands. \n\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader. \n\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page. \n\n\nLanguage\n\n\u00a9 Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're permitted to use this graph as long as you provide prominent attribution with a link back close to the use of the graph.

This month was 1.51\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, marking the 13th month in a 14-month period where global temperatures exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. The year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, the highest on record for this period.In Europe, August 2024 was the second warmest on record, with temperatures 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Southern and eastern Europe experienced the highest anomalies, while northwestern parts of Ireland, the UK, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway were below average. Globally, temperatures were most above average in eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia, and below average in far eastern Russia, Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan, and the Sahel.The average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest on record for the month. The equatorial Pacific showed below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs remained unusually high in many regions.Hydrologically, August 2024 was drier than average over most of continental Europe, including southern UK and Ireland, the Alps, the Balkans, northwest Russia, and eastern Fennoscandia, with droughts and wildfires in the south and east. Conversely, Iceland, northern UK and Ireland, much of Fennoscandia, the northern seaboard of continental Europe, and western Russia and T\u00fcrkiye experienced above-average precipitation, leading to floods and damage in some areas. Outside Europe, eastern North America, central Russia, eastern China, and eastern Australia were wetter than average, while Mexico, southern North America, regions of Russia, China, most of South America, and Southern Africa were drier than average, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia, and Brazil.The global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C). The average temperature for European land for summer 2024 was the highest on record at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Summer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe, while most of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe experienced drier-than-average conditions, sometimes associated with drought.The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides detailed monthly climate bulletins based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations worldwide. The service is part of the EU's Copernicus Earth observation programme, which aims to provide reliable and up-to-date information about the planet and its environment.",

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\u00a0\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates. The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\u00a0\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\u00a0\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\r\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\r\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR. Please refer to \u201cKey Performance Indicators\u201d below for more information.\r\n4. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results\n\nConsolidated results came in at the high end or ahead of guidance for key performance metrics\nBROOKLYN, N.Y., July 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, today announced results for its second quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024.\n\"We are pleased that second quarter consolidated results included sequential acceleration of Etsy marketplace year-over-year GMS, higher consolidated revenue both year-over-year and sequentially, and strong adjusted EBITDA profitability,\" said Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. Chief Executive Officer. \"Gifting is proving to be a winning theme - driving growth as a key source of differentiation for Etsy. We are making excellent progress with other bold moves and investments meant to raise consideration among buyers - to help us stand apart more than ever. While this is a challenging environment for our type of goods, we are focused on reigniting Etsy marketplace growth and gaining market share.\"\nSecond quarter 2024 performance highlights include:\n\"We are investing in strategic growth areas including Gifting, highlighting the best of Etsy through Quality initiatives, launching a new Loyalty Program, expanding our App, and more, while also carefully managing expenses to deliver very healthy profit,\" said Rachel Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. \"In fact, second quarter adjusted EBITDA was about 28%, ahead of our guidance and up 130 bps from last year, as we gained leverage year-over-year on employee costs and cost of revenue, which was partially offset by higher level of performance marketing investments to help fuel buyer growth and frequency. The Etsy marketplace's record level of active buyers has held up quite well, and we added approximately 12 million new and reactivated buyers during the quarter.\"\n______________________________________\n1\u00a0Etsy Gifting GMS: Estimate based upon word 'gift' in the listing title, shipped with a gift message, or other signal the item was purchased as a gift.\n2\u00a0Source: Consumer Edge spend data from sampling of credit card transactions from online 'gifting' peers Zola, Zazzle, Minted, Uncommon Goods, Hallmark, and Mark and Graham.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Summary(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThe financial results of Elo7 have been included in our consolidated financial results for the prior year periods, as Elo7 was sold on August 10, 2023.

In 2024, we are focused on building buyer consideration by making it easier to 'find the best stuff' on Etsy, driving association that Etsy sellers offer great value, and making shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable. The below highlights some of our key initiatives:\nProduct Highlights:\nIn order to drive\u00a0buyer Consideration, we are making progress in our efforts to position Etsy as an indispensable partner for Gifting, with broad based investments positively impacting our performance:\nWe launched a \"Made for You\" microsite to increase consideration and help buyers get the most out of shopping on Etsy. It features our latest product improvements, including Gift Mode, the Deals Tab, the Etsy's Picks badge, and Etsy Purchase Protection.\u00a0The microsite was launched globally in June, is available in 11 languages, and has already attracted hundreds of thousands of users.\nTo help buyers 'find the best stuff on Etsy,' we invested in the following Quality initiatives:\nAligned with our efforts to make shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable, and also to drive international growth, we recently secured a new preferred shipping partnership with a third party to simplify cross-border logistics for Turkish sellers. We continued to expand Etsy Payments globally, with about 98% of our GMS now processed through our platform.\nWe worked to continue to build trust in our marketplace with a roll out of our new seller set-up fee in additional regions. This fee, meant to strengthen our new shop onboarding process, and in combination with added trust and safety enforcement - resulted in a significant decline in fraudulent onboarding, while continuing to provide ample access for creative entrepreneurs to start businesses on Etsy.\nMarketing Highlights:\nWe further developed plans to launch our new Etsy Insider Loyalty program, currently scheduled to be introduced in invitation-only beta form to targeted occasional Etsy U.S. buyers in mid-September. Etsy Insider will be buyer-fee based, offering free U.S. domestic shipping on millions of items, item discounts, first access merchandise and other benefits, with a goal to drive frequency and loyalty over time.\nWe now manage all of Etsy's paid search campaigns in-house, enabling us to reallocate the significant external costs of managing these campaigns directly into the campaigns themselves.\nTo support our U.S. sellers, we launched a targeted marketing campaign to promote the availability of a seller financing program offered via a third party partner. We've observed strong initial engagement from the campaign signaling interest and need for additional capital among our seller community.\nEtsy's Creator Collective program, which incentivizes creators and influencers to drive purchases, social conversation, and unique content for Etsy by providing affiliate links to any page on Etsy.com and boosting top posts, has reached over 260,000 participants.\nReverb\nDepop\nConsolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance\u00a0\nQ3 24 Guidance\nGMS \nWe currently estimate that Consolidated GMS will decline in the low single digit range on a year-over-year basis. \nTake Rate\nSimilar to Q2 24\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n~27%\nRegarding our full-year 2024 outlook, we reiterate that consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin should come in at least the same as the 2023 result.\nPlease note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.\nWith respect to our expectations under \"Consolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance \" and outlook for the remainder of 2024 above, reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; in particular, stock-based compensation expense, foreign exchange (gain) loss, interest and other non-operating income, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses, and other non-recurring expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\u00a0\nEtsy will host a video webcast conference call to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will be live-streamed via our Investor Relations website (investors.etsy.com) under the Events section. A copy of the earnings call presentation will also be posted to our website.\nA replay of the video webcast will be available through the same link following the conference call starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, for at least three months thereafter.\nAbout Etsy\nEtsy, Inc. operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world.

asset impairment charges;\u00a0restructuring and other exit (income) costs; and retroactive non-income tax expense. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure that presents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation, and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platforms.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income, revenue, and our other GAAP results.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and the Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 53,005\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 61,915\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 116,009\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 136,452\nExcluding:\nInterest and other non-operating income, net \n(3,947)\n(5,934)\n(9,257)\n(11,623)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n25,972\n(56,501)\n42,623\n(49,767)\nDepreciation and amortization\n27,087\n22,946\n53,933\n46,118\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n74,717\n77,281\n145,400\n145,964\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n(4,861)\n(1,852)\n(11,116)\n765\nAcquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses \n234\n289\n2,132\n578\nAsset impairment charges\n\u2014\n68,091\n\u2014\n68,091\nRestructuring and other exit (income) costs \n(76)\n\u2014\n342\n\u2014\nRetroactive non-income tax expense\u00a0 (2)\n7,244\n\u2014\n7,244\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 179,375\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 166,235\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 347,310\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 336,578\nDivided by:\nRevenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 647,806\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 628,876\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,293,760\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,269,753\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n27.7\u00a0%\n26.4\u00a0%\n26.8\u00a0%\n26.5\u00a0%\n(1)\nStock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented below is as follows:\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCost of revenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,787\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,171\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,491\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15,417\nMarketing\n5,882\n6,107\n12,319\n11,369\nProduct development\n38,441\n38,220\n72,505\n74,929\nGeneral and administrative\n21,607\n24,783\n44,085\n44,249\nStock-based compensation expense \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74,717\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 77,281\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,400\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,964\n(2)\nRetroactive non-income tax expense related to the digital services tax legislation in Canada, which was enacted on June 28, 2024 retroactive to January 1, 2022.\n\u00a0\n View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/etsy-inc-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211378.html\nSOURCE  Etsy, Inc.\n\nEmail Alerts\n\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

    "Document3": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

    "Summarized_Document3": "The Etsy marketplace, founded in 2005, connects buyers with makers, artists, designers, and crafters selling unique handmade, originally designed, or specially-selected vintage items. However, as the seller community grew and inventory expanded globally, the marketplace became cluttered with goods that didn't meet Etsy's handmade criteria. In response, Etsy is doubling down on its founding mission to 'keep commerce human,' as stated by CEO Josh Silverman. In the first quarter of 2024, Etsy reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sales (GMS) from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Fiscal 2023 also saw a 2% drop in GMS from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, despite an increase in active sellers from 5.4 million to 7 million and a 3% rise in active buyers to 92 million. On a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023. The loss in 2022 was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge related to the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. Etsy ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting 225 employees. Silverman acknowledged the challenging macro and competitive environment, noting that GMS has remained flat since 2021. To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2.

We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.

    "Document3": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2.

    "Summarized_Document3": "The Etsy marketplace, founded in 2005, connects buyers with makers, artists, designers, and crafters selling unique handmade, originally designed, or specially-selected vintage items. However, as the seller community grew and inventory expanded globally, the marketplace became cluttered with goods that didn't meet Etsy's handmade criteria. In response, Etsy is doubling down on its founding mission to 'keep commerce human,' as stated by CEO Josh Silverman. In the first quarter of 2024, Etsy reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sales (GMS) from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Fiscal 2023 also saw a 2% drop in GMS from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, despite an increase in active sellers from 5.4 million to 7 million and a 3% rise in active buyers to 92 million. On a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023. The loss in 2022 was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge related to the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. Etsy ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting 225 employees. Silverman acknowledged the challenging macro and competitive environment, noting that GMS has remained flat since 2021. To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

    "Document3": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

    "Summarized_Document3": "The Etsy marketplace, founded in 2005, connects buyers with makers, artists, designers, and crafters selling unique handmade, originally designed, or specially-selected vintage items. However, as the seller community grew and inventory expanded globally, the marketplace became cluttered with goods that didn't meet Etsy's handmade criteria. In response, Etsy is doubling down on its founding mission to 'keep commerce human,' as stated by CEO Josh Silverman. In the first quarter of 2024, Etsy reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sales (GMS) from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Fiscal 2023 also saw a 2% drop in GMS from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, despite an increase in active sellers from 5.4 million to 7 million and a 3% rise in active buyers to 92 million. On a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023. The loss in 2022 was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge related to the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. Etsy ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting 225 employees. Silverman acknowledged the challenging macro and competitive environment, noting that GMS has remained flat since 2021. To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

And other retailers struggled to compete during the summer shopping holiday.\nKey takeaways:\nConsumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, and although year-over-year growth was modest when compared with the performance of prior Prime Days, it was a small uptick over 2022.\nAmazon is No. 3 in Digital Commerce 360\u2019s new\u00a02023 Global Online Marketplaces Report, which ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by 2023 third-party GMV.\nHow much did Amazon make on Prime Day?\nDigital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon\u2019s sales on Prime Day hit $12.90 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 11 and 12. That\u2019s up 6.7% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2022, which ran July 12 and 13. Last year, sales grew 8.1% over the 2021 event to $12.09 billion. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon\u2019s 2020 event.\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event. That\u2019s up from 300 million last year, Amazon says.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nAmazon, No. 1 in the\u00a0Digital Commerce 360 Top 1000, launched Prime Day in July 2015 to celebrate the web behemoth\u2019s 20th year in business, offering deals on a bunch of products to mark the occasion. As the event evolved, Prime Day turned into a highly anticipated summer sale designed to drum up more business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shopping traffic from deal-seeking consumers.\nThe inaugural Prime Day lasted for 24 hours and encompassed nine countries including the U.S. In 2017, the sale was extended for 30 hours and expanded to a few more markets, and in 2018, Prime Day was a 36-hour event. By 2019, Amazon began running its current two-day sale spanning 18 countries. And this year, more than 20 markets participated.\nWith discounts available only to paying members, Prime Day also is a vehicle for Amazon to sign up more consumers for its popular loyalty plan. The $139-a-year or $14.99-a-month Prime membership program offers perks like free one- or two-day shipping, digital photo storage, and video and music streaming.\nOther retailers sales slow on Prime Day\nAmazon isn\u2019t alone in doing big sales on weekdays in July. Many of its top competitors held sales during the same period, with No. 2 Walmart Inc. returning to the promotional holiday this year after sitting out last year.\nHowever, many retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year, according to Digital Commerce 360\u2019s analysis of Similarweb traffic numbers. Last year, for example, Target Corp. (No. 5 in the Top 1000) grew traffic 42.3% over a control period two weeks prior to Prime Day. This year, traffic was up just 26.9%. Costco Wholesale Corp. (No. 6) went from a 24.6% bump last year to 16.7% this year. Best Buy Co. (No. 7), which usually gets huge increases in traffic as shoppers compare prices on big-ticket items, saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year.\nWalmart, which didn\u2019t participate in Prime Day promos last year, saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%. But even Amazon had a smaller increase in traffic compared to the control period, down less than 1% compared to 2022\u2019s bump.\nSome of this is a difference in promo strategy. Retailers were heavily promotional during the 4th of July holiday period this year, with more offering Independence Day sales than competing with Prime Day. Also, top competitors offered week-long sales, meaning shoppers could focus on Amazon during its two-day sale and turn to Target, Walmart and Costco afterward to pick up other deals.\nFor the full week, Target\u2019s bump was still lower than last year, but the decline was much softer, with an 18.6% decline for the week compared to a 36.5% decline for the two-day period. Walmart\u2019s bump similarly grew when looking at the full week, up 56.0% for the week compared to a 49.2% increase for the two-day period.\nHow we got here\nHere are some insights that helped Digital Commerce 360 derive its Amazon Prime Day sales estimates:\nConsumer spending up on Amazon during Prime Day\nAccording to figures from a Numerator panel, Prime Day shoppers\u2019 spending on the site went up in 2023. The firm derives its insights from purchasing patterns on the Amazon platform. For the full 48-hour period, the average order value registered $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\nUS Ecommerce: Poised for Takeoff? Insights from Digital Commerce 360\nNumerator data is based on 98,462 Prime Day orders placed through Amazon and spanning 34,185 unique households as well as a survey of more than 4,200 verified buyers.\nOutside of Amazon, sales weren\u2019t so rosy. Salesforce says non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second, with average discounts dropping to 18% this year compared to 30% last year.\u00a0According to the Commerce Cloud provider, discounting was higher during the 4th of July period, peaking at 25% on the holiday.\nStill, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, according to Adobe Analytics. The insights arm of technology company Adobe Inc. said U.S. ecommerce sales hit $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data of 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and 100 million SKUs.\nAmazon said the first day of the sales event marked its largest single-day sales ever.\nMerchants weigh in\nAndrey Klen is pleased with how things went for his company on Amazon.com during Prime Day this year. The co-founder and chief marketing officer of Petcube said \u201cPrime Day performed much better in comparison to the previous year. Compared to an average day, we\u2019ve seen a double-digit multiple on sales. We were able to beat optimistic high growth projections on our main product.\u201d\nKlen said sales numbers suggest that shoppers were excited about Prime Day this year and had planned purchases of Petcube products well in advance of the two-day sales event.\n\u201cWe had lower conversion a couple of days prior to Prime Day, followed by the massive explosion for the first hours on the date. Most likely, people were adding the products to the cart beforehand,\u201d Klen said.\nThrasio Holdings Inc., an investment company that has purchased a number of Amazon merchants, said some of its brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\u201cThese were the two most profitable days in Thrasio history,\u201d Thrasio CEO\u00a0Greg Greeley said in a written statement.\nThrasio\u2019s latest acquisition \u2014 a seller of insect-repellent spray called Ranger Ready Repellents \u2014 had a record-breaking day on Amazon and tripled its Prime Day 2022 sales.\nDo you rank in our databases?\nSubmit your data\u00a0and we\u2019ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\nSign up\nStay on top of the latest developments in the ecommerce industry.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\u00a0\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates. The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\u00a0\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\u00a0\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\r\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\r\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

And it\u2019s easy to set up an Etsy ad campaign! These are the steps you can follow:\nEtsy ad campaigns help users find your items. Your ads will appear on Category and Market pages and Etsy searches. Sellers also have control over who sees their ad campaigns for maximum reach.\nBut what makes a results-driven Etsy ad campaign is how you manage your budget. You may not have the means to set your budget to $50 daily. $1 to $2 may be more financially feasible.\nIn this case, don\u2019t promote all your listings on such a tight budget. Pick your best-selling items and advertise those. As you generate more income, you can increase your budget.\nUsing this strategy prevents you from blowing through a wad of cash trying to sell on Etsy. And that can quickly happen without controlling how much you invest in ad spending compared to how much profit you generate.\nHere\u2019s what Etsy\u2019s ad dashboard looks like:\nBrie Moore, the owner of\u00a0Breezy Tee, used an Esty ad campaign to help her shop reach its ultimate potential. She was eager to turn a profit and spent $1 to $2 advertising 30 listings. But she didn\u2019t get the reach she expected because her budget was far too little for marketing all those items.\nHowever, Brie didn\u2019t expand her budget but chose to be more selective in what items she promoted. When her best-selling items achieved impressive results for her ad campaign, she increased her daily ad spend budget by 50 cents.\nBrie also developed a rule that worked \u2013 she would never spend more than 20% of her revenue on her ad budget. To stay ahead of which items made the ad budget cut, Brie measured sales and not just ad clicks!\nThis frugal approach did the trick. Now Brie has the capital to invest in top-tier models and photography to scale her Etsy store.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #2: Make Shopping Seamless\nOnline buyers want convenience, and you must achieve this in your Etsy store. Remember, you don\u2019t just want once-off buyers. You want consumers to have a fantastic experience, so they return.\u00a0\nAnd to achieve seamless shopping for your Etsy buyers you should:\nThe owner of\u00a0Herma May, an Etsy store specializing in signature fragrances\u00a0achieved success by providing effortless Etsy shopping. She includes freebies in customer orders, uses Etsy store collections, and invests a lot of time in understanding what her buyers want.\u00a0\nThis Etsy store seller also provides ideas on how customers could use her fragrances and never leaves out any information about these products. She also includes a \u201ccustomer care\u201d card for every order, explaining how to use her fragrances for an improved customer experience.\nTaking it a step further, this seller uses unique packaging for every one of her fragrances. This tactic makes it easier for returning buyers to choose a fragrance as they\u2019re quickly attracted to distinct packaging they\u2019ve never seen before.\nFrom the fruits of her labor, this Etsy seller now has a five-star rating on Etsy, and most of her consumers are loyal buyers.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #3: Leverage Instagram Marketing\u00a0\nInstagram is a bustling social media platform for pretty much every business. And that includes your Etsy store. The main reason is that Esty and Instagram share a significant factor influencing customers\u2019 purchasing behaviors \u2013 good-quality images.\nTo use Instagram marketing to promote your Etsy products, you should:\nThe owner of the Etsy store,\u00a0Little Maggie Moo, wasn\u2019t gaining the reach she wanted through Etsy alone. But this didn\u2019t deter her from selling the Esty products she believed in. Instead, she took to Instagram and started marketing her items.\nShe passionately shares high-quality pictures of her products to attract her audience. Because this Etsy store is all about baby clothes, she uses images of her clothes on happy babies. Doing this creates a visual idea of what her products can deliver.\nBut that\u2019s not all she does. The owner of Little Maggie Moo interacts with other business accounts she\u2019s passionate about. This Etsy seller also consistently engages with her followers. She shares exciting work and strikes up conversations in her a comments section.\u00a0\nPlus, she also networks with other Etsy store owners offering products related to hers. Once promoting their products and sharing their content, some of these Etsy store owners return the favor! All this effort helped steadily increase her Instagram followers and optimize her engagement.\nBut what did it do for her Etsy store?\nShe generated over 4000 sales!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #4: Don\u2019t Forget SEO\nThere\u2019s a heck load of competition on Etsy, and you need to cut through the noise! And here\u2019s where trusty ol\u2019 SEO comes in.\nEtsy\u2019s search tool is pretty powerful, and buyers can find products in one of two ways:\nAs you can tell, many technicalities go behind Etsy\u2019s search engine to ensure it helps buyers find the products they\u2019re looking for. This is excellent news for your business, as you can use top SEO techniques to reach more users.\nSome of the best SEO tactics for Etsy marketing include:\nThe founder of an Etsy jewelry store,\u00a0Ringcrush, has generated over 100,000 sales since her launch in 2016! And guess what she says is her secret? Good SEO tactics like the techniques mentioned above!\nThis Etsy seller uses SEO to guide what she creates and how she markets her content, based on trending content!\nAnd here\u2019s another example!\nA different Etsy shop owner makes\u00a0$1500 to $2000 per week, thanks to her product sales. She chalks this up to her efforts to achieve maximum reach, which was only possible through a sound SEO strategy.\nPart of her strategy includes consistent and accurate keyword and hashtag research. She recommends always using these SEO elements in your listing to help stand out from your competition.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #5: Provide As Much Support as Possible\nHere\u2019s another effective Etsy marketing strategy related to delivering exceptional customer support.\u00a0\nRather than only focusing on your customer\u2019s experience while they shop, you should also consider the experience you provide after they buy your products. Taking this extra step helps maintain returning customers, and what every successful business needs!\nOnce customers have bought your Etsy products, keep them engaged through:\nUsing these techniques above will make your customers feel appreciated by your business. And if you know anything about customer appreciation, it certainly adds to brand loyalty!\nOwning two Etsy stores, Unmeasured Designs and Unmeasured Events, Tash uses a hands-on approach to maintain returning buyers. She\u2019s been on Etsy since 2017 and has racked up over $112,000 in sales.\nThe work behind her success boils down to keeping engaged with her customers after they\u2019ve made a purchase. She does this through email newsletters. Her buyers now have a point of contact to send her queries or concerns about her products.\nThanks to this approach, Tash keeps her consumers closely connected, and in turn, loyal to her businesses.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #6: Pay Close Attention to Analytics\u00a0\nEtsy analytics are very telling, and you shouldn\u2019t ignore them! If you don\u2019t know how to access Etsy analytics, here\u2019s how:\nWith access to all this valuable information, you can modify your approach to people interested in your Esty listings. You may find that you\u2019ve been targeting the wrong buyers, or the products you\u2019re investing in advertising aren\u2019t the best choices.\u00a0\nAlso, based on your analytics, don\u2019t be afraid to remove listings. If you see an item isn\u2019t performing well, you can try to optimize it, But if this problem persists, find a more profitable product.\nTo amp up your Etsy analytics, you can integrate Google analytics into Etsy. There are also many more tools and software you can use for more robust Etsy reporting.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s an example of Etsy stats:\nAmy Yee, the owner of Maeven Vintage, took full advantage of Esty\u2019s stats. She evaluates customer data like buyer locations, and purchasing habits while searching for keywords to inspire her products. Amy also uses Etsy to find popular vintage items and how much they sell for.\u00a0\nShe used this information to develop a long-term plan on how she would set her budget, market her store and create her items. With a foolproof business plan developed on the foundation of Esty stats, Amy Yee could expand her Etsy businesses into several pop-up shops around New York.\nAnd, this also helped her land in many publications and magazines!\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #7: Get Orders Delivered to Buyers ASAP\nThis may seem like general knowledge, but for some sellers, it isn\u2019t! Late orders are against Etsy\u2019s seller service standards, so it can harm your ability to sell on this platform,\u00a0\nAnd not forgetting, buyers will give you bad reviews, making you less of a contender to them and Etsy\u2019s search engine algorithm.\nIf you don\u2019t think this is a common mistake, then let me help prove it:\nIt takes about 3 to 7 working days to get Esty products, and you should do everything possible to make this happen. In an instance where something super unforeseeable happens, let your buyers know and make it up to them.\nYou could give them a discount or a freebie as a way to apologize. Doing this will show you are sincere about a late delivery, and defuse angry customers!\nJess Yuda, the owner of Planner Peace,\u00a0makes over $12,000 per month\u00a0from her Etsy store. But this is possible because of how seriously she takes customer service, and in turn, on-time deliveries.\u00a0\nThis Etsy seller does her best to deliver products within 3 to 5 working days. And to achieve this, she works with reliable delivery providers she\u2019s built rapport with. At any time Jess can\u2019t fulfill her quick delivery turnaround time, she informs her customers and sends them freebies!\nFrom this strategy, you can see how a small example of Etsy marketing contributes to a generous profit.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #8: Organization is Key\nWhen your Etsy store starts to take off, you must employ stricter organizational methods. Quickly losing count of your orders, revenue, expenses, and inventory will set you back from success.\nHands-on organization will also help you scale your business, as you have more resources to draw business proposals and plans.\u00a0\nTo organize your Etsy store, you can do the following:\nOnce you apply these Etsy organizational techniques, you\u2019ll find it much easier to scale and manage your store!\nThe owner of an Etsy store,\u00a0Jenna Crucitti Designs, proves the power of good organizational skills for Etsy\u2019s marketing success.\u00a0\nOnce hitting 2700 Etsy sales and earning more than $10,000 in profit, this Etsy shop owner decided she needed to organize her strategy for maximum results and productivity. As this transformed into a full-time job, it gave her even more reason to get organized!\nSo, Jenna took to QuickBooks to document all her monthly finances. And helping her process, she separates her personal finances from her store\u2019s spending and earnings.\nBut wait!\u00a0\nIt gets even better!\nNow, Jenna also uses her organizational techniques to help her claim tax deductions and gain tax benefits!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #9: Ensure You Use High-Quality Photography\nWe briefly glanced over this while exploring Instagram marketing for selling Etsy products. But exceptional photography plays a huge role in Etsy, and deserves to be a strategy on its own.\nIf you use good-quality images on Etsy, you stand a greater chance of closing a sale.\u00a0\nHere are the top reasons why Etsy sellers need top-quality images:\nYou don\u2019t have to hire a professional photographer to take your Etsy product pictures. I mean, that would help, but it\u2019s not necessary when you\u2019re starting. All you need is a great camera (it can be a phone\u2019s camera), beautiful lighting, and as many tries as it takes, to get that \u201cWOW\u201d angle.\nIf you\u2019re struggling, YouTube has loads of resources on how to take amazing pictures using a phone!\nThey call her Etsy\u2019s most profitable seller, and her name is\u2026.Alicia Shaffer! Alicia racks up $70,000 worth of sales every month, and pins her success on fantastic photography.\nRather than only photographing the product, she showcases how it looks as part of an outfit. And she also exchanges the simple white background for various outdoor settings as this compliments her items.\nTo develop the perfect eye for her products, this OG Etsy seller evaluated her competitors\u2019 images and checked what worked and what didn\u2019t.\u00a0\nAs she\u2019s achieved quite a bit of success, Alicia now uses top-tier photographers, models, and sets to put her products at the forefront of her competitors.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #10: Use Exciting Email Newsletters\nEmail marketing is an excellent communication channel to include in your Etsy marketing strategy. When you use email, you build better relationships with your buyers and excite them about your products.\nEmail newsletters for an Etsy marketing campaign also effectively remind your buyers about your brand. Successful Etsy marketing relies on repeat buyers, and email newsletters achieve this.\nUsing email newsletters to engage your Etsy buyers, take steps like:\nDon\u2019t forget to include your branding and brand voice in your email newsletters. You want to leave an impression on your buyers so they know what to expect from your business!\nAfter sending a drawn-out series of bland email newsletters, Cassie Uhl, an Etsy shop seller, noticed she\u2019s not getting her ideal response. But this isn\u2019t where she stopped. Instead, she started sending emails that went beyond trying to secure sales.\nCassie Uhl focuses her newsletters on connecting to her buyers and making them feel like family. She shares her blog content, suggests products that add more value to her buyers, and ultimately, brings her readers into her creative process.\nAnother smart move from this Esty seller is that she aligns her content calendar with her email newsletters, so sharing relevant information is easier. Because of this wholesome approach, Cassie Uhl developed loyal customers and stronger brand-to-consumer relationships.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #11: Diversify Your Offerings\nYou don\u2019t have to stick to one item for your Etsy store. You can diversify your offerings based on what you\u2019re passionate about and how all these products relate to each other. But you don\u2019t want to promote items that are too unrelated as this may confuse your buyers.\nFor example, if you\u2019re selling handmade football balls, you could also sell handmade quirky socks and silly football T-shirts.\u00a0\nWhen you diversify your offerings, you create multiple revenue streams, leading to higher profits.\u00a0\nIf you want to diversify your products consider factors like:\nAnd here\u2019s another aspect to consider \u2013 you can also open another Etsy store to sell products that don\u2019t relate to your current store. Obviously, this will take work, but it\u2019s still welcoming another revenue stream.\u00a0\nVana Chupp opened an Etsy store offering custom silhouettes. But she found her passion didn\u2019t end there and started a second Etsy store offering graphic design art and providing coaching to women aspiring to become business owners.\nShe started by developing herself as an expert in one area and grew her Etsy store until she could diversify her offerings. Now she also sells various books based on her artworks alongside her graphic design pieces and silhouettes.\nWhile this is certainly a much more complex strategy, it\u2019s best to consider it when you want to scale your Etsy store. And using the \u201cbig picture\u201d approach has worked well for this Etsy seller!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #12: Leverage Press Releases and Free Publicity\nPress releases mean more free publicity, and this is what you need to skyrocket your Etsy store sales. The more people know about your store, the better, and you need to secure coverage in online and offline publications and magazines to achieve this.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to leverage press releases for your Etsy store, here\u2019s how:\nHoning your pitch and becoming familiar with the publications will determine if you secure press coverage or not. So, you want to take your time with this and ensure your pitch highlights your best values and proves how you can add value to their readers.\u00a0\nWhen Erin Flett launched her first Etsy store, she only sold 30 products in her first year. Pretty daunting, right!\nBut she realized that she needed more publicity. To get her Etsy store out there, she did her homework and found the best publications for her products. Erin started networking with professionals related to those publications through LinkedIn, or email (if she could find an email address).\nErin spent a lot of time understanding the content and voices of the publications she wanted to pitch to, and crafted her messages accordingly. She pitched to all sorts of businesses, and every time, her angle was unique and custom to the receiver. Boosting her chances, she also included photos!\nThanks to all this effort, Erin has earned more than $3000 in sales and has featured on the covers of four of the best-selling magazines in the US!\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #13: Branding, Branding, and More Branding\nBranding is vital for your Etsy marketing campaign because you want to optimize customer experience. With consistent branding throughout your Etsy marketing efforts, you can develop a brand identity that customers can become familiar with.\nThink about this in your own life: You trust the brands you use because they have an established identity.\nTo develop branding for your Etsy store, consider factors like:\nOnce you\u2019ve nailed those elements down, you can build a brand identity and use this across your entire Etsy store and other social channels you choose for marketing.\u00a0\nAfter Iris Pohlgeers started her vintage Etsy store, she received constructive criticism on her images and style. This feedback inspired her to consider a new approach for her store\u2019s design.\u00a0\nShe brainstormed a color palette that encompassed her stores values and used this across her Etsy store. Iris also used her new-found branding to inspire her images and how they looked. She uses a consistent background for all her images so her shop is distinctive.\u00a0\nIris also ensures her branding is formatted for mobile and desktop! Because of her efforts to develop consistent branding, Iris has experienced exponential growth and confirms that her branding played a huge role.\u00a0\nSummary 13 Etsy Marketing Strategies\nConclusion\nEtsy marketing isn\u2019t a simple endeavor with the vast competition this online marketplace has.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon nears $13 billion in Prime Day sales\nAmazon boosted its overall Prime Day sales to record numbers, but growth is slowing. Consumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, with a 6.7% year-over-year increase to $12.90 billion globally during the event on July 11 and 12, 2024. This is up from $12.09 billion in 2022 and $11.19 billion in 2021.\n\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities, and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\n\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event, up from 300 million last year. The average order value was $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\n\nOther retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year. For example, Target Corp. grew traffic 26.9% this year compared to 42.3% last year. Costco Wholesale Corp. saw a bump of 16.7% this year compared to 24.6% last year. Best Buy Co. saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year. Walmart saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%.\n\nSales outside of Amazon weren\u2019t as strong. Salesforce reported non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second. However, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, hitting $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data.\n\nMerchants like Petcube and Thrasio Holdings Inc. reported significant sales increases during Prime Day. Petcube saw a double-digit multiple on sales compared to an average day, and Thrasio\u2019s brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\nIn summary, Amazon's Prime Day 2024 had a significant impact on total revenue in July 2024, with nearly $13 billion in sales, marking a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Other retailers experienced mixed results, with some seeing smaller traffic increases and others reporting declines in sales.",

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Expressed in US millions)\n\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), Shopify uses certain non-GAAP and other financial measures to provide additional information in order to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

And other retailers struggled to compete during the summer shopping holiday.\nKey takeaways:\nConsumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, and although year-over-year growth was modest when compared with the performance of prior Prime Days, it was a small uptick over 2022.\nAmazon is No. 3 in Digital Commerce 360\u2019s new\u00a02023 Global Online Marketplaces Report, which ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by 2023 third-party GMV.\nHow much did Amazon make on Prime Day?\nDigital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon\u2019s sales on Prime Day hit $12.90 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 11 and 12. That\u2019s up 6.7% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2022, which ran July 12 and 13. Last year, sales grew 8.1% over the 2021 event to $12.09 billion. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon\u2019s 2020 event.\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event. That\u2019s up from 300 million last year, Amazon says.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nAmazon, No. 1 in the\u00a0Digital Commerce 360 Top 1000, launched Prime Day in July 2015 to celebrate the web behemoth\u2019s 20th year in business, offering deals on a bunch of products to mark the occasion. As the event evolved, Prime Day turned into a highly anticipated summer sale designed to drum up more business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shopping traffic from deal-seeking consumers.\nThe inaugural Prime Day lasted for 24 hours and encompassed nine countries including the U.S. In 2017, the sale was extended for 30 hours and expanded to a few more markets, and in 2018, Prime Day was a 36-hour event. By 2019, Amazon began running its current two-day sale spanning 18 countries. And this year, more than 20 markets participated.\nWith discounts available only to paying members, Prime Day also is a vehicle for Amazon to sign up more consumers for its popular loyalty plan. The $139-a-year or $14.99-a-month Prime membership program offers perks like free one- or two-day shipping, digital photo storage, and video and music streaming.\nOther retailers sales slow on Prime Day\nAmazon isn\u2019t alone in doing big sales on weekdays in July. Many of its top competitors held sales during the same period, with No. 2 Walmart Inc. returning to the promotional holiday this year after sitting out last year.\nHowever, many retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year, according to Digital Commerce 360\u2019s analysis of Similarweb traffic numbers. Last year, for example, Target Corp. (No. 5 in the Top 1000) grew traffic 42.3% over a control period two weeks prior to Prime Day. This year, traffic was up just 26.9%. Costco Wholesale Corp. (No. 6) went from a 24.6% bump last year to 16.7% this year. Best Buy Co. (No. 7), which usually gets huge increases in traffic as shoppers compare prices on big-ticket items, saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year.\nWalmart, which didn\u2019t participate in Prime Day promos last year, saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%. But even Amazon had a smaller increase in traffic compared to the control period, down less than 1% compared to 2022\u2019s bump.\nSome of this is a difference in promo strategy. Retailers were heavily promotional during the 4th of July holiday period this year, with more offering Independence Day sales than competing with Prime Day. Also, top competitors offered week-long sales, meaning shoppers could focus on Amazon during its two-day sale and turn to Target, Walmart and Costco afterward to pick up other deals.\nFor the full week, Target\u2019s bump was still lower than last year, but the decline was much softer, with an 18.6% decline for the week compared to a 36.5% decline for the two-day period. Walmart\u2019s bump similarly grew when looking at the full week, up 56.0% for the week compared to a 49.2% increase for the two-day period.\nHow we got here\nHere are some insights that helped Digital Commerce 360 derive its Amazon Prime Day sales estimates:\nConsumer spending up on Amazon during Prime Day\nAccording to figures from a Numerator panel, Prime Day shoppers\u2019 spending on the site went up in 2023. The firm derives its insights from purchasing patterns on the Amazon platform. For the full 48-hour period, the average order value registered $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\nUS Ecommerce: Poised for Takeoff? Insights from Digital Commerce 360\nNumerator data is based on 98,462 Prime Day orders placed through Amazon and spanning 34,185 unique households as well as a survey of more than 4,200 verified buyers.\nOutside of Amazon, sales weren\u2019t so rosy.

By focusing on customer acquisition, market segmentation, and brand positioning, Alibaba has established a dominant presence in the e-commerce landscape. With its comprehensive approach, the company excels in both the B2B and B2C markets, catering to businesses of all sizes and individual consumers.\nOne of the key factors behind Alibaba\u2019s success is its digital marketing solutions, which include SEO, online advertising, and social media marketing. By leveraging these tools, Alibaba drives brand promotion and boosts sales, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of the industry. The company\u2019s commitment to customer acquisition and market segmentation has solidified its position as a leader in the e-commerce space.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have enabled it to compete with international e-commerce giants. With a network that reaches over 150 countries in the global logistics industry, Alibaba has formed partnerships with companies in retail, logistics, and technology sectors to reach more consumers and offer a wider range of products and services.\nFurthermore, Alibaba\u2019s brand positioning efforts through online advertising have helped it become a trusted and reliable partner for businesses and consumers. The company\u2019s innovative tactics, such as the annual November 11 sale, have played a significant role in generating record-breaking revenues. In fact, Alibaba earned $14.3 billion (\u20ac13.45 billion) revenue in just 24 hours, making it the highest revenue gained in one shopping day worldwide.\nUnder the visionary leadership of CEO Daniel Zhang, Alibaba continues to thrive. With over 24,000 employees in 70 offices worldwide, the company remains committed to its mission of reaching over 500 million consumers in 200 countries.\nKey Takeaways:\nAlibaba\u2019s Dominance in E-commerce\nWhen it comes to e-commerce, Alibaba is a force to be reckoned with. This multinational conglomerate has carved out a dominant position in both the B2B and B2C markets, solidifying its e-commerce dominance in China and beyond.\nAlibaba\u2019s success can be attributed to its customer-centric approach, placing the needs of users at the heart of its strategy. By creating a user-friendly platform, Alibaba has been able to attract and retain a large user base, offering them a seamless shopping experience.\nIn 2014, Alibaba went public with a staggering 83% market share in China\u2019s e-commerce market. Since then, the landscape has changed with the rise of competitors like Pinduoduo and JD.com. However, Alibaba has managed to maintain a significant market share, currently standing at 39.5%. While its market share has decreased, it is still a force to be reckoned with.\nAlibaba\u2019s continuous growth is fueled by its strong performance in the B2B and B2C sectors. One of its key strengths is its well-integrated supply chain, which allows for efficient operations and reduced costs. Moreover, Alibaba\u2019s Chinese e-commerce unit, Taobao & Tmall Group, experienced a 4% growth in revenue during the fourth quarter, demonstrating its resilience in a competitive market.\nTo enhance user experience and stay ahead of the competition, Alibaba focuses on improved product discovery tools and personalized recommendations. This customer-centric approach ensures that users find exactly what they\u2019re looking for, keeping them engaged and satisfied.\nMarket Share Comparison\nExamining the market share landscape, we can see that while Alibaba\u2019s share has decreased, it still maintains a significant lead over its competitors. Pinduoduo has witnessed substantial growth, increasing its market share from 11% to 16% in 2021. Meanwhile, JD.com has remained stable within the range of 16-18%.\nAs Alibaba continues to navigate the ever-changing e-commerce landscape, it faces competition not only from domestic players but also from global giants like Temu and SHEIN. However, Alibaba\u2019s strong brand positioning and global expansion efforts, including its focus on the US market, give it a competitive edge.\nAll in all, Alibaba\u2019s dominance in e-commerce is a result of its customer-centric approach, user-friendly platform, and continuous efforts to enhance the overall shopping experience. With its unwavering focus on innovation and global expansion, Alibaba is set to maintain its position as a leader in the e-commerce industry.\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAs Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce arm, AliExpress, operates in 150 countries, the company has been successful in its global expansion efforts. By forging strategic partnerships and making strategic investments, Alibaba has extended its reach beyond China, aiming to capture new markets and compete with major players like Amazon.\nOne key strategy Alibaba employs in its global expansion is forming strategic partnerships with established brands and companies. For instance, Tmall Luxury Pavilion, launched in 2017, has attracted 80 luxury brands, including Burberry and Versace, to sell their products directly to Chinese consumers. This strategic partnership has allowed Alibaba to tap into the luxury market and cater to the increasing demand for high-end goods in China.\nAnother important aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is its focus on connecting small and medium-sized brands from around the world with Alibaba customers in China. Through Taobao Global, Alibaba partners with these brands, providing them with access to a massive consumer base in China, while also bringing a diverse range of products to Chinese consumers.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not limited to China or Asia. The company has made significant investments in online marketplaces in Southeast Asia, such as Lazada, where Alibaba invested $4 billion. This investment has allowed Alibaba to gain a strong foothold in the Southeast Asian market and expand its global reach.\nAdditionally, Alibaba has acquired e-commerce sites like Daraz in South Asia, made investments in companies like Tokopedia in Indonesia and Paytm in India, and partnered with MegaFon and Russia\u2019s Mail.Ru Group to establish AliExpress Russia. These moves highlight Alibaba\u2019s commitment to expanding its presence in key markets and capitalizing on the growth opportunities they offer.\nCompetitive analysis also plays a crucial role in Alibaba\u2019s global expansion strategy. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of its competitors, such as Amazon and eBay, Alibaba can identify areas for improvement and innovation. This competitive analysis allows Alibaba to stay ahead in the global e-commerce landscape and navigate the challenges posed by regional competitors.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles related to foreign investments, e-commerce, and data privacy pose obstacles that Alibaba must navigate and overcome. Furthermore, competition from global players like Amazon and regional competitors requires Alibaba to invest significantly in customer support and innovation.\nAnother crucial aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is adapting its strategies to local markets and consumer preferences. Navigating cultural differences is vital for Alibaba to succeed in new markets and ensure its strategies resonate with local consumers.\nIn summary, Alibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have been driven by strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and investments in key markets. With its presence in 150 countries, Alibaba is successfully competing with major players in the e-commerce industry. By conducting comprehensive competitive analysis and adapting to local markets, Alibaba continues to expand its global footprint and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce.\nAlibaba\u2019s Brand Positioning\nAlibaba, a global leader in e-commerce, has strategically positioned itself as a trusted and reliable brand through innovative online advertising campaigns.

With a commitment to innovation, Alibaba continually enhances its platform to provide an unparalleled user experience.\nThe company\u2019s brand positioning is further reinforced by its strong emphasis on trust and credibility. Alibaba\u2019s secure payment options and stringent quality control measures contribute to its reputation as a reliable partner.\nFounder Jack Ma\u2019s significant recognition and popularity have also played a crucial role in building Alibaba\u2019s brand image. His entrepreneurial journey and success have made him a household name, further enhancing the company\u2019s credibility.\nAlibaba\u2019s brand positioning has enabled it to surpass retail giants like Walmart in global sales and achieve the world\u2019s biggest IPO in 2014. Today, the company holds a place within the global top 10 market cap.\nTo support its brand positioning, Alibaba has expanded its operations into major global markets, allowing it to reach a larger customer base. The company\u2019s presence in nearly 240 countries worldwide is a testament to its global dominance.\nTo visually represent Alibaba\u2019s brand positioning, the image below showcases the company\u2019s logo, embodying trust, innovation, and credibility:\nIn conclusion, Alibaba has successfully positioned itself as a trusted and innovative brand through strategic online advertising campaigns.

And it\u2019s easy to set up an Etsy ad campaign! These are the steps you can follow:\nEtsy ad campaigns help users find your items. Your ads will appear on Category and Market pages and Etsy searches. Sellers also have control over who sees their ad campaigns for maximum reach.\nBut what makes a results-driven Etsy ad campaign is how you manage your budget. You may not have the means to set your budget to $50 daily. $1 to $2 may be more financially feasible.\nIn this case, don\u2019t promote all your listings on such a tight budget. Pick your best-selling items and advertise those. As you generate more income, you can increase your budget.\nUsing this strategy prevents you from blowing through a wad of cash trying to sell on Etsy. And that can quickly happen without controlling how much you invest in ad spending compared to how much profit you generate.\nHere\u2019s what Etsy\u2019s ad dashboard looks like:\nBrie Moore, the owner of\u00a0Breezy Tee, used an Esty ad campaign to help her shop reach its ultimate potential. She was eager to turn a profit and spent $1 to $2 advertising 30 listings. But she didn\u2019t get the reach she expected because her budget was far too little for marketing all those items.\nHowever, Brie didn\u2019t expand her budget but chose to be more selective in what items she promoted. When her best-selling items achieved impressive results for her ad campaign, she increased her daily ad spend budget by 50 cents.\nBrie also developed a rule that worked \u2013 she would never spend more than 20% of her revenue on her ad budget. To stay ahead of which items made the ad budget cut, Brie measured sales and not just ad clicks!\nThis frugal approach did the trick. Now Brie has the capital to invest in top-tier models and photography to scale her Etsy store.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #2: Make Shopping Seamless\nOnline buyers want convenience, and you must achieve this in your Etsy store. Remember, you don\u2019t just want once-off buyers. You want consumers to have a fantastic experience, so they return.\u00a0\nAnd to achieve seamless shopping for your Etsy buyers you should:\nThe owner of\u00a0Herma May, an Etsy store specializing in signature fragrances\u00a0achieved success by providing effortless Etsy shopping. She includes freebies in customer orders, uses Etsy store collections, and invests a lot of time in understanding what her buyers want.\u00a0\nThis Etsy store seller also provides ideas on how customers could use her fragrances and never leaves out any information about these products. She also includes a \u201ccustomer care\u201d card for every order, explaining how to use her fragrances for an improved customer experience.\nTaking it a step further, this seller uses unique packaging for every one of her fragrances. This tactic makes it easier for returning buyers to choose a fragrance as they\u2019re quickly attracted to distinct packaging they\u2019ve never seen before.\nFrom the fruits of her labor, this Etsy seller now has a five-star rating on Etsy, and most of her consumers are loyal buyers.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #3: Leverage Instagram Marketing\u00a0\nInstagram is a bustling social media platform for pretty much every business. And that includes your Etsy store. The main reason is that Esty and Instagram share a significant factor influencing customers\u2019 purchasing behaviors \u2013 good-quality images.\nTo use Instagram marketing to promote your Etsy products, you should:\nThe owner of the Etsy store,\u00a0Little Maggie Moo, wasn\u2019t gaining the reach she wanted through Etsy alone. But this didn\u2019t deter her from selling the Esty products she believed in. Instead, she took to Instagram and started marketing her items.\nShe passionately shares high-quality pictures of her products to attract her audience. Because this Etsy store is all about baby clothes, she uses images of her clothes on happy babies. Doing this creates a visual idea of what her products can deliver.\nBut that\u2019s not all she does. The owner of Little Maggie Moo interacts with other business accounts she\u2019s passionate about. This Etsy seller also consistently engages with her followers. She shares exciting work and strikes up conversations in her a comments section.\u00a0\nPlus, she also networks with other Etsy store owners offering products related to hers. Once promoting their products and sharing their content, some of these Etsy store owners return the favor! All this effort helped steadily increase her Instagram followers and optimize her engagement.\nBut what did it do for her Etsy store?\nShe generated over 4000 sales!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #4: Don\u2019t Forget SEO\nThere\u2019s a heck load of competition on Etsy, and you need to cut through the noise! And here\u2019s where trusty ol\u2019 SEO comes in.\nEtsy\u2019s search tool is pretty powerful, and buyers can find products in one of two ways:\nAs you can tell, many technicalities go behind Etsy\u2019s search engine to ensure it helps buyers find the products they\u2019re looking for. This is excellent news for your business, as you can use top SEO techniques to reach more users.\nSome of the best SEO tactics for Etsy marketing include:\nThe founder of an Etsy jewelry store,\u00a0Ringcrush, has generated over 100,000 sales since her launch in 2016! And guess what she says is her secret? Good SEO tactics like the techniques mentioned above!\nThis Etsy seller uses SEO to guide what she creates and how she markets her content, based on trending content!\nAnd here\u2019s another example!\nA different Etsy shop owner makes\u00a0$1500 to $2000 per week, thanks to her product sales. She chalks this up to her efforts to achieve maximum reach, which was only possible through a sound SEO strategy.\nPart of her strategy includes consistent and accurate keyword and hashtag research. She recommends always using these SEO elements in your listing to help stand out from your competition.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #5: Provide As Much Support as Possible\nHere\u2019s another effective Etsy marketing strategy related to delivering exceptional customer support.\u00a0\nRather than only focusing on your customer\u2019s experience while they shop, you should also consider the experience you provide after they buy your products. Taking this extra step helps maintain returning customers, and what every successful business needs!\nOnce customers have bought your Etsy products, keep them engaged through:\nUsing these techniques above will make your customers feel appreciated by your business. And if you know anything about customer appreciation, it certainly adds to brand loyalty!\nOwning two Etsy stores, Unmeasured Designs and Unmeasured Events, Tash uses a hands-on approach to maintain returning buyers. She\u2019s been on Etsy since 2017 and has racked up over $112,000 in sales.\nThe work behind her success boils down to keeping engaged with her customers after they\u2019ve made a purchase. She does this through email newsletters. Her buyers now have a point of contact to send her queries or concerns about her products.\nThanks to this approach, Tash keeps her consumers closely connected, and in turn, loyal to her businesses.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #6: Pay Close Attention to Analytics\u00a0\nEtsy analytics are very telling, and you shouldn\u2019t ignore them! If you don\u2019t know how to access Etsy analytics, here\u2019s how:\nWith access to all this valuable information, you can modify your approach to people interested in your Esty listings. You may find that you\u2019ve been targeting the wrong buyers, or the products you\u2019re investing in advertising aren\u2019t the best choices.\u00a0\nAlso, based on your analytics, don\u2019t be afraid to remove listings. If you see an item isn\u2019t performing well, you can try to optimize it, But if this problem persists, find a more profitable product.\nTo amp up your Etsy analytics, you can integrate Google analytics into Etsy. There are also many more tools and software you can use for more robust Etsy reporting.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s an example of Etsy stats:\nAmy Yee, the owner of Maeven Vintage, took full advantage of Esty\u2019s stats. She evaluates customer data like buyer locations, and purchasing habits while searching for keywords to inspire her products. Amy also uses Etsy to find popular vintage items and how much they sell for.\u00a0\nShe used this information to develop a long-term plan on how she would set her budget, market her store and create her items. With a foolproof business plan developed on the foundation of Esty stats, Amy Yee could expand her Etsy businesses into several pop-up shops around New York.\nAnd, this also helped her land in many publications and magazines!\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #7: Get Orders Delivered to Buyers ASAP\nThis may seem like general knowledge, but for some sellers, it isn\u2019t! Late orders are against Etsy\u2019s seller service standards, so it can harm your ability to sell on this platform,\u00a0\nAnd not forgetting, buyers will give you bad reviews, making you less of a contender to them and Etsy\u2019s search engine algorithm.\nIf you don\u2019t think this is a common mistake, then let me help prove it:\nIt takes about 3 to 7 working days to get Esty products, and you should do everything possible to make this happen. In an instance where something super unforeseeable happens, let your buyers know and make it up to them.\nYou could give them a discount or a freebie as a way to apologize. Doing this will show you are sincere about a late delivery, and defuse angry customers!\nJess Yuda, the owner of Planner Peace,\u00a0makes over $12,000 per month\u00a0from her Etsy store. But this is possible because of how seriously she takes customer service, and in turn, on-time deliveries.\u00a0\nThis Etsy seller does her best to deliver products within 3 to 5 working days. And to achieve this, she works with reliable delivery providers she\u2019s built rapport with. At any time Jess can\u2019t fulfill her quick delivery turnaround time, she informs her customers and sends them freebies!\nFrom this strategy, you can see how a small example of Etsy marketing contributes to a generous profit.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #8: Organization is Key\nWhen your Etsy store starts to take off, you must employ stricter organizational methods. Quickly losing count of your orders, revenue, expenses, and inventory will set you back from success.\nHands-on organization will also help you scale your business, as you have more resources to draw business proposals and plans.\u00a0\nTo organize your Etsy store, you can do the following:\nOnce you apply these Etsy organizational techniques, you\u2019ll find it much easier to scale and manage your store!\nThe owner of an Etsy store,\u00a0Jenna Crucitti Designs, proves the power of good organizational skills for Etsy\u2019s marketing success.\u00a0\nOnce hitting 2700 Etsy sales and earning more than $10,000 in profit, this Etsy shop owner decided she needed to organize her strategy for maximum results and productivity. As this transformed into a full-time job, it gave her even more reason to get organized!\nSo, Jenna took to QuickBooks to document all her monthly finances. And helping her process, she separates her personal finances from her store\u2019s spending and earnings.\nBut wait!\u00a0\nIt gets even better!\nNow, Jenna also uses her organizational techniques to help her claim tax deductions and gain tax benefits!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #9: Ensure You Use High-Quality Photography\nWe briefly glanced over this while exploring Instagram marketing for selling Etsy products. But exceptional photography plays a huge role in Etsy, and deserves to be a strategy on its own.\nIf you use good-quality images on Etsy, you stand a greater chance of closing a sale.\u00a0\nHere are the top reasons why Etsy sellers need top-quality images:\nYou don\u2019t have to hire a professional photographer to take your Etsy product pictures. I mean, that would help, but it\u2019s not necessary when you\u2019re starting. All you need is a great camera (it can be a phone\u2019s camera), beautiful lighting, and as many tries as it takes, to get that \u201cWOW\u201d angle.\nIf you\u2019re struggling, YouTube has loads of resources on how to take amazing pictures using a phone!\nThey call her Etsy\u2019s most profitable seller, and her name is\u2026.Alicia Shaffer! Alicia racks up $70,000 worth of sales every month, and pins her success on fantastic photography.\nRather than only photographing the product, she showcases how it looks as part of an outfit. And she also exchanges the simple white background for various outdoor settings as this compliments her items.\nTo develop the perfect eye for her products, this OG Etsy seller evaluated her competitors\u2019 images and checked what worked and what didn\u2019t.\u00a0\nAs she\u2019s achieved quite a bit of success, Alicia now uses top-tier photographers, models, and sets to put her products at the forefront of her competitors.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #10: Use Exciting Email Newsletters\nEmail marketing is an excellent communication channel to include in your Etsy marketing strategy. When you use email, you build better relationships with your buyers and excite them about your products.\nEmail newsletters for an Etsy marketing campaign also effectively remind your buyers about your brand. Successful Etsy marketing relies on repeat buyers, and email newsletters achieve this.\nUsing email newsletters to engage your Etsy buyers, take steps like:\nDon\u2019t forget to include your branding and brand voice in your email newsletters. You want to leave an impression on your buyers so they know what to expect from your business!\nAfter sending a drawn-out series of bland email newsletters, Cassie Uhl, an Etsy shop seller, noticed she\u2019s not getting her ideal response. But this isn\u2019t where she stopped. Instead, she started sending emails that went beyond trying to secure sales.\nCassie Uhl focuses her newsletters on connecting to her buyers and making them feel like family. She shares her blog content, suggests products that add more value to her buyers, and ultimately, brings her readers into her creative process.\nAnother smart move from this Esty seller is that she aligns her content calendar with her email newsletters, so sharing relevant information is easier. Because of this wholesome approach, Cassie Uhl developed loyal customers and stronger brand-to-consumer relationships.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #11: Diversify Your Offerings\nYou don\u2019t have to stick to one item for your Etsy store. You can diversify your offerings based on what you\u2019re passionate about and how all these products relate to each other. But you don\u2019t want to promote items that are too unrelated as this may confuse your buyers.\nFor example, if you\u2019re selling handmade football balls, you could also sell handmade quirky socks and silly football T-shirts.\u00a0\nWhen you diversify your offerings, you create multiple revenue streams, leading to higher profits.\u00a0\nIf you want to diversify your products consider factors like:\nAnd here\u2019s another aspect to consider \u2013 you can also open another Etsy store to sell products that don\u2019t relate to your current store. Obviously, this will take work, but it\u2019s still welcoming another revenue stream.\u00a0\nVana Chupp opened an Etsy store offering custom silhouettes. But she found her passion didn\u2019t end there and started a second Etsy store offering graphic design art and providing coaching to women aspiring to become business owners.\nShe started by developing herself as an expert in one area and grew her Etsy store until she could diversify her offerings. Now she also sells various books based on her artworks alongside her graphic design pieces and silhouettes.\nWhile this is certainly a much more complex strategy, it\u2019s best to consider it when you want to scale your Etsy store. And using the \u201cbig picture\u201d approach has worked well for this Etsy seller!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #12: Leverage Press Releases and Free Publicity\nPress releases mean more free publicity, and this is what you need to skyrocket your Etsy store sales. The more people know about your store, the better, and you need to secure coverage in online and offline publications and magazines to achieve this.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to leverage press releases for your Etsy store, here\u2019s how:\nHoning your pitch and becoming familiar with the publications will determine if you secure press coverage or not. So, you want to take your time with this and ensure your pitch highlights your best values and proves how you can add value to their readers.\u00a0\nWhen Erin Flett launched her first Etsy store, she only sold 30 products in her first year. Pretty daunting, right!\nBut she realized that she needed more publicity. To get her Etsy store out there, she did her homework and found the best publications for her products. Erin started networking with professionals related to those publications through LinkedIn, or email (if she could find an email address).\nErin spent a lot of time understanding the content and voices of the publications she wanted to pitch to, and crafted her messages accordingly. She pitched to all sorts of businesses, and every time, her angle was unique and custom to the receiver. Boosting her chances, she also included photos!\nThanks to all this effort, Erin has earned more than $3000 in sales and has featured on the covers of four of the best-selling magazines in the US!\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #13: Branding, Branding, and More Branding\nBranding is vital for your Etsy marketing campaign because you want to optimize customer experience. With consistent branding throughout your Etsy marketing efforts, you can develop a brand identity that customers can become familiar with.\nThink about this in your own life: You trust the brands you use because they have an established identity.\nTo develop branding for your Etsy store, consider factors like:\nOnce you\u2019ve nailed those elements down, you can build a brand identity and use this across your entire Etsy store and other social channels you choose for marketing.\u00a0\nAfter Iris Pohlgeers started her vintage Etsy store, she received constructive criticism on her images and style. This feedback inspired her to consider a new approach for her store\u2019s design.\u00a0\nShe brainstormed a color palette that encompassed her stores values and used this across her Etsy store. Iris also used her new-found branding to inspire her images and how they looked. She uses a consistent background for all her images so her shop is distinctive.\u00a0\nIris also ensures her branding is formatted for mobile and desktop! Because of her efforts to develop consistent branding, Iris has experienced exponential growth and confirms that her branding played a huge role.\u00a0\nSummary 13 Etsy Marketing Strategies\nConclusion\nEtsy marketing isn\u2019t a simple endeavor with the vast competition this online marketplace has.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon nears $13 billion in Prime Day sales\nAmazon boosted its overall Prime Day sales to record numbers, but growth is slowing. Consumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, with a 6.7% year-over-year increase to $12.90 billion globally during the event on July 11 and 12, 2024. This is up from $12.09 billion in 2022 and $11.19 billion in 2021.\n\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities, and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\n\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event, up from 300 million last year. The average order value was $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\n\nOther retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year. For example, Target Corp. grew traffic 26.9% this year compared to 42.3% last year. Costco Wholesale Corp. saw a bump of 16.7% this year compared to 24.6% last year. Best Buy Co. saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year. Walmart saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%.\n\nSales outside of Amazon weren\u2019t as strong. Salesforce reported non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second. However, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, hitting $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data.\n\nMerchants like Petcube and Thrasio Holdings Inc. reported significant sales increases during Prime Day. Petcube saw a double-digit multiple on sales compared to an average day, and Thrasio\u2019s brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\nIn summary, Amazon's Prime Day 2024 had a significant impact on total revenue in July 2024, with nearly $13 billion in sales, marking a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Other retailers experienced mixed results, with some seeing smaller traffic increases and others reporting declines in sales.",

This website provides an impartial, fact-based overview of K-12 education in the Buckeye State. We hope these data will help to inform conversations about improving education throughout the state. If you have ideas on how this could be improved and made more useful to you, write to us at ohiogadfly@fordhaminstitute.org. For more information about the Institute and its work, please visit www.fordhaminstitute.org/ohio\nView the Report\nStudentEnrollment\n\nOhio Public School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 1.6 million public school students of varying backgrounds and characteristics.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23). Note: Public school enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students, but do not include students attending joint-vocational districts and educational service centers, pupils attending non-public schools, or home schooled students. More information about those enrollments are found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchool Options\u00e2\u0080\u009d section.\nPublic School Enrollment by Grade\u00a0Level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23).\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest race/ethnic student groups, white and African American students, has also declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent change from 2006 to 2023. The chart displays the spring part of the school year, a convention often used in this guide.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, public school enrollment has increased significantly among Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander students.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends by Selected Characteristics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, English learner enrollment has more than doubled, while the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The number of students identified as gifted has declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nLow Income Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe percentage of students identified as economically disadvantaged has increased since 2005-06. However, the percentage of Ohio children living in poverty has remained mostly static.\nSource: Economically disadvantaged data are from Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23); childhood poverty data are from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Kids Count Data Center and based on U.S. Census poverty estimates (data were not reported for 2020 and are not yet available for 2023). Notes: Ohio identifies students as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomically disadvantaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d via federal meal programs, open to pupils from households with incomes at or below 185% of federal poverty. However, in 2010, Congress passed the Community Eligibility Provision which allows certain schools to deem all students as disadvantaged (even higher-income children) for the purposes of meals eligibility. In contrast, children in poverty are from households at or below 100% federal poverty.\nOhio School Districts and Typologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor analytic purposes, the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce categorizes districts into eight typologies based on their geographic and socio-economic characteristics. This publication displays various statistics by typology to illustrate patterns of enrollment and achievement across the state.\nSource: Ohio DEW, School District Typology. Note: This map displays the border of each district and its corresponding typology.\nPublic School Students by Typology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas and 35 percent are from suburban communities; 21 percent live in small towns while 15 percent are from rural areas.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: Public charter and STEM schools are assigned to the typology of the district in which the school is located, as reported in DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community school directory. Online charters\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as e-schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094are not included in a typology, since they can enroll students statewide.\nPublic School Students in Urban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents living in urban areas come from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, and almost nine in ten are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the urban typologies (i.e., urban: very high poverty and urban: high poverty).\nPublic School Students in Suburban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from suburban areas are majority white, with modest racial and ethnic diversity. About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the suburban typologies (i.e., suburban: very low poverty and suburban: low poverty).\nPublic School Students in Small Town Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe large majority of students from small towns are white and more than two in five are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the small town typologies (i.e., small town: high poverty and small town: low poverty).\nPublic School Students in Rural Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from rural areas are overwhelmingly white and just under half are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the rural typologies (i.e., rural: average poverty and rural: high poverty).\nOhio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twenty-Five Largest Districts by Enrollment (2022-23)\nNote: Ohio Virtual Academy, a statewide e-school, is considered equivalent to a school district. This table does not include charter or STEM students as part of the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student population. Enrollment changes of less than +/- 1 percent are considered to have had no substantive change (marked as \u00e2\u0080\u009c--\u00e2\u0080\u009c).\nSchoolOptions\n\nEnrollment by Educational Model\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, while more than 110,000 students attend charter schools and more than 200,000 students attend non-public schools or homeschool.\nSources: All data are for 2022-23 and drawn from various sources from Ohio DEW.\nPublic Charter Schools\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 334 charter schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as community schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094serving more than 110,000 students.\nSources: Ohio DEW downloadable file titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d was used to calculate enrollments for 2022-23 and the community school directory was used to identify the type of charter school. Historical enrollment data were drawn from DEW, Community School Annual Report: 2021-2022.\nCharacteristics of Charter School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of charter school students are economically disadvantaged, and a majority are Black or Hispanic. Nearly 70 percent of charter school students attend brick-and-mortar charters located in urban communities.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23). Note: All statistics in this table include online charter schools; they are not assigned to district typologies, however, because they can draw students from all areas of the state.\nInterdistrict Open Enrollment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFour in five Ohio districts participate in interdistrict open enrollment. Approximately 80,000 students open enroll, with participation generally, until recently, increasing over time.\nSources: Two sources were used for this chart, based on the availability of data. For 2002-03 to 2011-12, data from the Ohio Auditor of State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 report, Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Open Enrollment were used. For 2012-13 to 2022-23, enrollments are calculated based on school districts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 funding reports; see Ohio DEW, Traditional Public Schools Funding.\nPrivate School Scholarships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore than 80,000 students used state-funded scholarships (often referred to as vouchers) to attend private schools in 2022-23.\nSource: Historical Historical data through 2020-21 are from American Federation for Children, School Choice Yearbook (2021). Ohio DEW began recently reporting more detailed voucher data and beginning with 2021-22, numbers are from Advanced Reports. Note: The chart displays the total number of students in the various scholarship programs. For more information on each program, see Ohio DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s webpage, Scholarships.\nHomeschooling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNearly 50,000 students participate in homeschooling; the number of homeschoolers significantly increased in 2020-21 and has decreased slightly since then.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Homeschool Student Data. Note: Students attending online charter schools are not considered homeschool students.\nStudent Achievement:National Exams\n\nNational Exams: NAEP 2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApproximately 30 to 40 percent of Ohio students reach the national standard for proficiency, just above the national average.\nSource: National Assessment of Educational Progress, Data Explorer (2022). Note: The figure displays proficiency rates\u00e2\u0080\u0094the percentage of students achieving NAEP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rigorous proficiency benchmark. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), considered the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Report Card,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is administered to a representative sample of fourth and eighth grade students in each state every two years in reading and math.\nOhio Compared to Other States\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNationally, Ohio ranks between 11th and 20th in fourth and eighth grade math and reading. Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national position has typically been between 10th and 20th for the past two decades.\nSource: National Assessment of Educational Progress, Data Explorer.

Today, most college and university students in the U.S. take at least some classes online.\nOnline degrees have a broad reach, encompassing new higher education concepts like microcredentials and massive open online courses (MOOCs), along with traditional college degrees.\nDistance learners, too, are a diverse group. As a remote student, your peers may include traditional college-age students, working parents, military service members, established professionals and lifelong learners.\nThis fast-growing field clearly holds wide appeal, but how big is online learning, exactly?\nThis article examines the popularity of online learning, charting how fast the field has grown in recent years and exploring the motivations behind distance learning. If you\u2019re a prospective or current online student, a parent or an educator\u2014or if you\u2019re just curious about the online learning phenomenon\u2014these are the key statistics to know.\nKey Takeaways\nOnline Learning by the Numbers\nAll types of colleges and universities offer classes online. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), public colleges enrolled about 8.5 million online students in 2021. Another 2.7 million remote learners attended private schools, including 1.9 million at nonprofit institutions and nearly 800,000 at for-profit schools.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the availability of online learning in higher education starting in 2020. NCES reports that 75% of all postsecondary students in the U.S.\u2014over 14 million learners\u2014took online classes in fall 2020 as the pandemic restricted in-person learning, whereas only 36% had enrolled in distance education in fall 2019.\nWith many schools opening classrooms for in-person learning again in 2021, the percentage of students enrolled in distance learning courses dropped to about 60%\u2014still much higher than in pre-pandemic years.\nOnline enrollment levels vary depending on where students live. Alaska, Hawai\u2019i and New Hampshire boast the highest percentages of online students in the United States.\nOnline Schools vs. Traditional College\nMany online degree seekers attend traditional schools, but as of 2020, about 15% of all U.S. college students attended primarily online institutions. NCES defines primarily online schools as those enrolling 90% or more of their student body in distance education. About 11% of U.S. colleges and universities\u2014422 institutions in total\u2014fit this profile.\nOften catering to working students, some online schools have always offered fully remote programs. Others began as traditional campus-based institutions, later establishing online divisions that grew to dwarf their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\nIn 2020, primarily online schools enrolled over 1.5 million full-time degree seekers. Another 1.2 million learners took classes part time. Female students outnumbered male students among both full-time and part-time enrollees, making up about 62% of all learners.\nOnline Learning Through the Years\nIn 2020, the onset of Covid-19 disrupted traditional education, abruptly forcing students, instructors and administrators to adapt to remote learning models.\nEven before the pandemic, however, remote learning had been growing steadily for almost a decade as daily life became more digitized and remote learning technology and infrastructure improved.\nIn 2012\u2014a watershed year in online education that saw the founding of MOOC giants edX and Coursera\u2014over 25% of U.S. college and university students took at least one distance learning course, NCES reports. By 2019, that number had risen to 36%, about half of whom attended exclusively online.\nIn 2020, the number of online students at traditional higher education institutions exploded as schools shifted courses online amid lockdown restrictions. During that year, about 46% of U.S. learners studied entirely online, and another 28% took at least some courses remotely. As of 2021, remote learning numbers remained high, with about 60% of college students taking some or all of their classes online.\nMany traditional degree-seeking students returned to in-person learning when schools reopened in 2021, but online education as a whole continued to grow.\nThe World Economic Forum reports that in 2016, Coursera had 21 million registered users. By 2019, 44 million learners used the MOOC platform. This number leaped to 71 million in 2020, but unlike online college enrollment numbers, Coursera\u2019s enrollment did not drop in 2021. Instead, the platform gained even more users, totaling 92 million in 2022.\nOnline Degrees\nRemote learning programs serve this growing body of online students with degree programs at all levels. NCES reports that in the 2019-20 academic year, primarily online colleges conferred:\nMale-identifying students earned 37% to 39% of these degrees, with female-identifying students earning 61% to 63%.\nStudents at primarily online schools make up 14.7% of all college and university enrollees. They earn:\nOnline doctoral programs are relatively uncommon; remote learners earn only 7.6% of all doctorates.\nOnline Learning by Race\nOnline schools serve a racially diverse student body, with more than half of all learners identifying as nonwhite. These institutions enroll minority learners at higher rates than conventional schools across most reported categories, as shown in the chart below.\nIlana Hamilton is a writer and editor specializing in education and career topics.

Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

Lower Cost of Living\nFlorida offers a moderate cost of living, with a cost-of-living index of 102.4%. The cost-of-living index measures the cost of housing, food, healthcare, and other basic expenses in a state compared to the national average. Florida has the 33rd lowest cost of living.\n3. More Diverse Classrooms\nMany Florida colleges accept online learners from across state lines or even internationally, which allows you to make connections across the nation and world. Online programs attract a diverse selection of students to learn with and from.\n4. Flexible and Convenient Format\nYou can earn your degree online without traveling to campus or attend a hybrid program that incorporates in-person learning.

In fact, the private sector in Florida added 42,800 jobs in July 2023. Students attending college in Florida will graduate into a healthy job market.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Online Colleges in Florida\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the easiest online college to get into in Florida?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, is one of the easiest online colleges to get into in the Sunshine State. The college admitted 100% of applicants in the fall of 2023.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the University of Miami, which admitted 19% of the 48,286 applicants in the fall of 2023, has one of the most selective admission processes in Florida, according to NCES.

Transfer students to the main campus need at least 60 college credits, while UF Online accepts lower-division transfer students with only 12 credits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIs online college free in Florida?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nNo, an online degree is not free in Florida. That said, you can find non-credit online courses at institutions such as South Florida State College. Florida students may also apply for fee waivers or exemptions, which provide discounts or an entirely free education.

    "Summarized_Document1": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "ARTICLE Online vs in-person learning in higher education: effects on student achievement and recommendations for leadership Bandar N. Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Document3": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

    "Summarized_Document2": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses.

    "Summarized_Document3": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "ARTICLE Online vs in-person learning in higher education: effects on student achievement and recommendations for leadership Bandar N. Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

We then ranked each school according to the top variables college students selected in our College Choice and Admissions Survey. To learn more, check out our full rankings methodology or read the summary below.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRanking Methodology Summary\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo qualify for our rankings lists, each school must be an accredited public or private, nonprofit institution. Each eligible school was then ranked based on a formula measuring:\n\n\nIn addition, we only included colleges with graduation rates in the top third of all online colleges.\nFlorida College Tuition\nCollege tuition runs far cheaper in Florida than the national average. Undergraduates attending public four-year colleges in Florida in 2022-2023 paid $4,540 for tuition and fees, about $5,000 less than the national average.\nPrivate college students in Florida also pay less, spending an average of $30,928 in tuition and fees, while the national average for private college tuition was $35,248 in 2022-2023.\nFlorida online colleges may offer a more affordable education since you don't need to pay for transportation and on-campus housing fees, though online learners sometimes need to pay technology fees not charged to on-campus students.\nIn addition, online tuition often costs less than studying on campus. For instance, in-state undergrads at the University of Florida pay $6,380 per year, while in-state undergrads at UF Online pay $3,876 per year. In this case, attending the University of Florida Online will save you nearly 50% in tuition.\nWhy Study Online in Florida?\nOnline learning offers many benefits beyond convenience, affordability, and flexibility. Here are five reasons you should consider online universities in Florida.\n1. Study at Your Own Pace\nOnline learning blends independent study with live or prerecorded lectures, discussions, and virtual assistance. As an online learner, you may work primarily asynchronously, meeting deadlines each week, or attend live classes, where you can interact with instructors and classmates.\n2. Lower Cost of Living\nFlorida offers a moderate cost of living, with a cost-of-living index of 102.4%. The cost-of-living index measures the cost of housing, food, healthcare, and other basic expenses in a state compared to the national average. Florida has the 33rd lowest cost of living.\n3. More Diverse Classrooms\nMany Florida colleges accept online learners from across state lines or even internationally, which allows you to make connections across the nation and world. Online programs attract a diverse selection of students to learn with and from.\n4. Flexible and Convenient Format\nYou can earn your degree online without traveling to campus or attend a hybrid program that incorporates in-person learning. Students can choose classes that work around their work schedule and family life.\n5. Growing Job Market\nFlorida saw a 2.6% job growth rate from July 2022-2023, compared to 1.9% nationally, according to the Florida governor's office. In fact, the private sector in Florida added 42,800 jobs in July 2023.

    "Summarized_Document2": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

We then ranked each school according to the top variables college students selected in our College Choice and Admissions Survey. To learn more, check out our full rankings methodology or read the summary below.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRanking Methodology Summary\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo qualify for our rankings lists, each school must be an accredited public or private, nonprofit institution. Each eligible school was then ranked based on a formula measuring:\n\n\nIn addition, we only included colleges with graduation rates in the top third of all online colleges.\nFlorida College Tuition\nCollege tuition runs far cheaper in Florida than the national average. Undergraduates attending public four-year colleges in Florida in 2022-2023 paid $4,540 for tuition and fees, about $5,000 less than the national average.\nPrivate college students in Florida also pay less, spending an average of $30,928 in tuition and fees, while the national average for private college tuition was $35,248 in 2022-2023.\nFlorida online colleges may offer a more affordable education since you don't need to pay for transportation and on-campus housing fees, though online learners sometimes need to pay technology fees not charged to on-campus students.\nIn addition, online tuition often costs less than studying on campus. For instance, in-state undergrads at the University of Florida pay $6,380 per year, while in-state undergrads at UF Online pay $3,876 per year. In this case, attending the University of Florida Online will save you nearly 50% in tuition.\nWhy Study Online in Florida?\nOnline learning offers many benefits beyond convenience, affordability, and flexibility. Here are five reasons you should consider online universities in Florida.\n1. Study at Your Own Pace\nOnline learning blends independent study with live or prerecorded lectures, discussions, and virtual assistance. As an online learner, you may work primarily asynchronously, meeting deadlines each week, or attend live classes, where you can interact with instructors and classmates.\n2. Lower Cost of Living\nFlorida offers a moderate cost of living, with a cost-of-living index of 102.4%. The cost-of-living index measures the cost of housing, food, healthcare, and other basic expenses in a state compared to the national average. Florida has the 33rd lowest cost of living.\n3. More Diverse Classrooms\nMany Florida colleges accept online learners from across state lines or even internationally, which allows you to make connections across the nation and world. Online programs attract a diverse selection of students to learn with and from.\n4. Flexible and Convenient Format\nYou can earn your degree online without traveling to campus or attend a hybrid program that incorporates in-person learning. Students can choose classes that work around their work schedule and family life.\n5. Growing Job Market\nFlorida saw a 2.6% job growth rate from July 2022-2023, compared to 1.9% nationally, according to the Florida governor's office. In fact, the private sector in Florida added 42,800 jobs in July 2023. Students attending college in Florida will graduate into a healthy job market.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Online Colleges in Florida\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the easiest online college to get into in Florida?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, is one of the easiest online colleges to get into in the Sunshine State. The college admitted 100% of applicants in the fall of 2023.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the University of Miami, which admitted 19% of the 48,286 applicants in the fall of 2023, has one of the most selective admission processes in Florida, according to NCES. UM offers 10 online master's and doctoral programs and 12 certificates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIs it hard to get into the University of Florida Online?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe University of Florida Online is easier to get into than the University of Florida main campus.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive.

Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test.\nAverage ACT Scores by State\nBelow is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAverage ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US\nLet's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States.\nHighest Possible ACT Score\u00c2\u00a0\nThe highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test.\nACT Scores By Percentile\u00c2\u00a0\nACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nSource: ACT.org\nBased on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive).\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile.\u00c2\u00a0\nOverall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nAre you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies.\nFAQs\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs!\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good?\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application.\u00c2\u00a0\n4. What Is a Low ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nLike what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to?\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce your ACT score is released, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant!\u00c2\u00a0\n6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT?\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant.\n7. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lowest Possible ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe lowest ACT score possible is 1.\n8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section?\nThe average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc.\n9. What is The Average Science ACT Score?\nThe average science ACT score is 20.\nFinal Thoughts\nNow that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.\u00c2\u00a0 A good way to go about it is to test your skills with our Free ACT Practice Questions Pop Quiz.

Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score. An LSAT score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program.\nYou just need to have the right kind of application.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the median LSAT score, let\u2019s move on to the highest scores.\nWhat is the highest LSAT score?\u00a0\nLSAT scores can range anywhere from 120 to 180.\nGetting a perfect 180 on the LSAT is practically unheard of. In fact, just 0.1% of test-takers have achieved it.\nA 170 is considered a great score, as it would mean you got at least 90 of the 101 questions on the test right.\u00a0\nDoing so would put you in the top 2-3% of test takers, meaning you would get into most law schools.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the kind of LSAT scores you would need to be accepted into the top 10 law schools in the country.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for the top 10 law schools?\u00a0\nIf you want to\u00a0attend one of the top 10 law schools in the country, you should aim for an LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the low, median, and high LSAT scores at each school.\nStanford University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nYale University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0175\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0178\nUniversity of Chicago\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (Carey)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0167\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nDuke University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0168\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0170\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0171\nHarvard University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0174\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nNew York University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0174\nColumbia University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Virginia\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nNorthwestern University (Pritzker)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0172\nAs you can see, each of these schools has a median LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nBut even with a lower score, you can still get in.\nKeep reading to learn how.\nHow important are LSAT scores for law school admissions?\nIt\u2019s true that a higher score will increase your chances of acceptance into the law school of your choice.\nTypically, a score that falls within the 150 range is considered average. While it will get you accepted into most law schools, it could make it difficult to stand out.\nA score of at least 160 is considered strong, and most law schools have median scores within this range. However, keep in mind that scholarships may require higher scores.\nLast but not least, a score of 170 or more puts you comfortably among the top 2-3% of test-takers and will certainly get the attention of some of the best law schools in the country.\nBut I want to let you in on a secret: Your admission doesn\u2019t hinge solely on your LSAT score.\nYour\u00a0undergraduate GPA\u00a0also plays a part in it.\nAccording to the ABA,\u00a0the average GPA among admitted law school students\u00a0is around 3.6. But just like LSAT scores, that average varies across schools.\nAmong students who get into top-tier law schools like the ones mentioned earlier, the average GPA is 3.8 or higher.\nWhile both your GPA and LSAT scores are important factors in determining how successful you would be as a law school student, schools tend to weigh the LSAT more heavily.\nBut even if you score a couple of points lower than the median LSAT score or GPA at your number one school of choice, don\u2019t let it keep you from applying.\nThe law school admission process is a holistic one, which means that they\u2019ll look at more than just your score.\nIt all comes down to being able to prove you have what it takes to succeed as a law student in your application. With the right strategy, application elements like your personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation will help you stand out.\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on average LSAT scores and the kind of scores needed for top schools, let\u2019s move on to the three different types of LSAT scores.\nHow does LSAT work?\u00a0\nWhen talking about LSAT scores, most people only talk about the numbers, like 150, 170, or 180.\nBut there are actually\u00a0three\u00a0types of LSAT scores you should be aware of.\nThe first is called the raw score. Your raw score reflects the number of questions you answered correctly on the test.\nFor instance, if an LSAT was made up of 100 questions and you got 85 correct, you would score an 85.\nThe second type of score is a scaled score, which is the kind of score you\u2019re probably most familiar with.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0the kind of score that reads 150, 170, or 180.\u00a0\nA scaled score is what you get when you convert your raw score into an LSAT score based on the Score Conversion Chart. In this chart, scores range from 120 to 180.\nFinally, there\u2019s a percentile score, which shows how well you tested compared to others who have taken the LSAT over the last three years.\u00a0\nNext steps\nThere you have it! Everything you need to know about what makes for a good LSAT score.\nDon\u2019t let the pressure of a high LSAT score keep you from trying.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right kind of application strategy.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve worked with several students who have scored well beneath the median and still gone on to receive admission letters.\nIf you want to make sure you\u2019re a top candidate, sign up for my\u00a0on-demand workshop today.

    "Summarized_Document1": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",

    "Summarized_Document3": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive.

Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score. An LSAT score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program.\nYou just need to have the right kind of application.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the median LSAT score, let\u2019s move on to the highest scores.\nWhat is the highest LSAT score?\u00a0\nLSAT scores can range anywhere from 120 to 180.\nGetting a perfect 180 on the LSAT is practically unheard of. In fact, just 0.1% of test-takers have achieved it.\nA 170 is considered a great score, as it would mean you got at least 90 of the 101 questions on the test right.\u00a0\nDoing so would put you in the top 2-3% of test takers, meaning you would get into most law schools.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the kind of LSAT scores you would need to be accepted into the top 10 law schools in the country.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for the top 10 law schools?\u00a0\nIf you want to\u00a0attend one of the top 10 law schools in the country, you should aim for an LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the low, median, and high LSAT scores at each school.\nStanford University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nYale University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0175\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0178\nUniversity of Chicago\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (Carey)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0167\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nDuke University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0168\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0170\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0171\nHarvard University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0174\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nNew York University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0174\nColumbia University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Virginia\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nNorthwestern University (Pritzker)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0172\nAs you can see, each of these schools has a median LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nBut even with a lower score, you can still get in.\nKeep reading to learn how.\nHow important are LSAT scores for law school admissions?\nIt\u2019s true that a higher score will increase your chances of acceptance into the law school of your choice.\nTypically, a score that falls within the 150 range is considered average. While it will get you accepted into most law schools, it could make it difficult to stand out.\nA score of at least 160 is considered strong, and most law schools have median scores within this range. However, keep in mind that scholarships may require higher scores.\nLast but not least, a score of 170 or more puts you comfortably among the top 2-3% of test-takers and will certainly get the attention of some of the best law schools in the country.\nBut I want to let you in on a secret: Your admission doesn\u2019t hinge solely on your LSAT score.\nYour\u00a0undergraduate GPA\u00a0also plays a part in it.\nAccording to the ABA,\u00a0the average GPA among admitted law school students\u00a0is around 3.6. But just like LSAT scores, that average varies across schools.\nAmong students who get into top-tier law schools like the ones mentioned earlier, the average GPA is 3.8 or higher.\nWhile both your GPA and LSAT scores are important factors in determining how successful you would be as a law school student, schools tend to weigh the LSAT more heavily.\nBut even if you score a couple of points lower than the median LSAT score or GPA at your number one school of choice, don\u2019t let it keep you from applying.\nThe law school admission process is a holistic one, which means that they\u2019ll look at more than just your score.\nIt all comes down to being able to prove you have what it takes to succeed as a law student in your application. With the right strategy, application elements like your personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation will help you stand out.\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on average LSAT scores and the kind of scores needed for top schools, let\u2019s move on to the three different types of LSAT scores.\nHow does LSAT work?\u00a0\nWhen talking about LSAT scores, most people only talk about the numbers, like 150, 170, or 180.\nBut there are actually\u00a0three\u00a0types of LSAT scores you should be aware of.\nThe first is called the raw score. Your raw score reflects the number of questions you answered correctly on the test.\nFor instance, if an LSAT was made up of 100 questions and you got 85 correct, you would score an 85.\nThe second type of score is a scaled score, which is the kind of score you\u2019re probably most familiar with.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0the kind of score that reads 150, 170, or 180.\u00a0\nA scaled score is what you get when you convert your raw score into an LSAT score based on the Score Conversion Chart. In this chart, scores range from 120 to 180.\nFinally, there\u2019s a percentile score, which shows how well you tested compared to others who have taken the LSAT over the last three years.\u00a0\nNext steps\nThere you have it! Everything you need to know about what makes for a good LSAT score.\nDon\u2019t let the pressure of a high LSAT score keep you from trying.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right kind of application strategy.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve worked with several students who have scored well beneath the median and still gone on to receive admission letters.\nIf you want to make sure you\u2019re a top candidate, sign up for my\u00a0on-demand workshop today.

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

This guide will teach you all you need to know about ACT scores!\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIf you want to evaluate how you compare to other test-takers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach you everything you need to know about your scores, including average ACT scores, percentiles, highest ACT scores possible, and much more.\nAverage ACT Scores (2024)\nACT scores range from 1 to 36 in each category (except for writing, out of 12). The average of your four scores determines your ACT composite score. According to ACT Score National Ranks, the average score in each category is:\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to know how the ACT is scored. \u00c2\u00a0First, the number of questions you got correct in each section is counted and converted to scale scores.\nThe average ACT score is 19.9. These rankings are based on almost 4.5 million \u00e2\u0080\u009cACT-tested high school graduates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe ACT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website also released score information for students who decided to take the optional writing test, which contributes to an English Language Arts score (ELA). The average writing and ELA scores are 6.2 and 18.3, respectively. Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test.\nAverage ACT Scores by State\nBelow is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAverage ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US\nLet's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States.\nHighest Possible ACT Score\u00c2\u00a0\nThe highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test.\nACT Scores By Percentile\u00c2\u00a0\nACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nSource: ACT.org\nBased on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive).\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile.\u00c2\u00a0\nOverall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nAre you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies.\nFAQs\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs!\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good?\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application.\u00c2\u00a0\n4. What Is a Low ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nLike what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to?\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce your ACT score is released, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant!\u00c2\u00a0\n6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT?\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant.\n7. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lowest Possible ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe lowest ACT score possible is 1.\n8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section?\nThe average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc.\n9. What is The Average Science ACT Score?\nThe average science ACT score is 20.\nFinal Thoughts\nNow that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.\u00c2\u00a0 A good way to go about it is to test your skills with our Free ACT Practice Questions Pop Quiz.

Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score. An LSAT score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program.\nYou just need to have the right kind of application.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the median LSAT score, let\u2019s move on to the highest scores.\nWhat is the highest LSAT score?\u00a0\nLSAT scores can range anywhere from 120 to 180.\nGetting a perfect 180 on the LSAT is practically unheard of. In fact, just 0.1% of test-takers have achieved it.\nA 170 is considered a great score, as it would mean you got at least 90 of the 101 questions on the test right.\u00a0\nDoing so would put you in the top 2-3% of test takers, meaning you would get into most law schools.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the kind of LSAT scores you would need to be accepted into the top 10 law schools in the country.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for the top 10 law schools?\u00a0\nIf you want to\u00a0attend one of the top 10 law schools in the country, you should aim for an LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the low, median, and high LSAT scores at each school.\nStanford University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nYale University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0175\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0178\nUniversity of Chicago\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (Carey)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0167\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nDuke University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0168\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0170\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0171\nHarvard University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0174\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nNew York University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0174\nColumbia University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Virginia\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nNorthwestern University (Pritzker)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0172\nAs you can see, each of these schools has a median LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nBut even with a lower score, you can still get in.\nKeep reading to learn how.\nHow important are LSAT scores for law school admissions?\nIt\u2019s true that a higher score will increase your chances of acceptance into the law school of your choice.\nTypically, a score that falls within the 150 range is considered average. While it will get you accepted into most law schools, it could make it difficult to stand out.\nA score of at least 160 is considered strong, and most law schools have median scores within this range. However, keep in mind that scholarships may require higher scores.\nLast but not least, a score of 170 or more puts you comfortably among the top 2-3% of test-takers and will certainly get the attention of some of the best law schools in the country.\nBut I want to let you in on a secret: Your admission doesn\u2019t hinge solely on your LSAT score.\nYour\u00a0undergraduate GPA\u00a0also plays a part in it.\nAccording to the ABA,\u00a0the average GPA among admitted law school students\u00a0is around 3.6. But just like LSAT scores, that average varies across schools.\nAmong students who get into top-tier law schools like the ones mentioned earlier, the average GPA is 3.8 or higher.\nWhile both your GPA and LSAT scores are important factors in determining how successful you would be as a law school student, schools tend to weigh the LSAT more heavily.\nBut even if you score a couple of points lower than the median LSAT score or GPA at your number one school of choice, don\u2019t let it keep you from applying.\nThe law school admission process is a holistic one, which means that they\u2019ll look at more than just your score.\nIt all comes down to being able to prove you have what it takes to succeed as a law student in your application. With the right strategy, application elements like your personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation will help you stand out.\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on average LSAT scores and the kind of scores needed for top schools, let\u2019s move on to the three different types of LSAT scores.\nHow does LSAT work?\u00a0\nWhen talking about LSAT scores, most people only talk about the numbers, like 150, 170, or 180.\nBut there are actually\u00a0three\u00a0types of LSAT scores you should be aware of.\nThe first is called the raw score. Your raw score reflects the number of questions you answered correctly on the test.\nFor instance, if an LSAT was made up of 100 questions and you got 85 correct, you would score an 85.\nThe second type of score is a scaled score, which is the kind of score you\u2019re probably most familiar with.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0the kind of score that reads 150, 170, or 180.\u00a0\nA scaled score is what you get when you convert your raw score into an LSAT score based on the Score Conversion Chart. In this chart, scores range from 120 to 180.\nFinally, there\u2019s a percentile score, which shows how well you tested compared to others who have taken the LSAT over the last three years.\u00a0\nNext steps\nThere you have it! Everything you need to know about what makes for a good LSAT score.\nDon\u2019t let the pressure of a high LSAT score keep you from trying.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right kind of application strategy.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve worked with several students who have scored well beneath the median and still gone on to receive admission letters.\nIf you want to make sure you\u2019re a top candidate, sign up for my\u00a0on-demand workshop today.

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",

For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u2019ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive). However, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile. Overall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time. Are you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies. FAQs If you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs! 1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good? Although a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score. 2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College? While even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness. 3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score? While it\u2019s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application. 4. What Is a Low ACT Score? Like what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low. 5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to? Once your ACT score is released, you\u2019ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant! 6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT? If your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant. 7. What\u2019s the Lowest Possible ACT Score? The lowest ACT score possible is 1. 8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section? The average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc. 9. What is The Average Science ACT Score? The average science ACT score is 20. Final Thoughts Now that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher. If you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.

    "Summarized_Document3": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive. Our guide can help you develop a personal SAT target score based on the colleges you're applying to.\nReaching for the stars?

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

    "Document3": "What is a Good LSAT Score? 2024 Data\nAre you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results?\nIf so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What\u00a0is\u00a0a good LSAT score?\nThen you\u2019re in the right place.\nReady? Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score. An LSAT score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program.\nYou just need to have the right kind of application.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the median LSAT score, let\u2019s move on to the highest scores.\nWhat is the highest LSAT score?\u00a0\nLSAT scores can range anywhere from 120 to 180.\nGetting a perfect 180 on the LSAT is practically unheard of. In fact, just 0.1% of test-takers have achieved it.\nA 170 is considered a great score, as it would mean you got at least 90 of the 101 questions on the test right.\u00a0\nDoing so would put you in the top 2-3% of test takers, meaning you would get into most law schools.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the kind of LSAT scores you would need to be accepted into the top 10 law schools in the country.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for the top 10 law schools?\u00a0\nIf you want to\u00a0attend one of the top 10 law schools in the country, you should aim for an LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the low, median, and high LSAT scores at each school.\nStanford University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nYale University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0175\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0178\nUniversity of Chicago\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (Carey)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0167\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nDuke University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0168\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0170\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0171\nHarvard University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0174\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nNew York University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0174\nColumbia University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Virginia\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nNorthwestern University (Pritzker)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0172\nAs you can see, each of these schools has a median LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nBut even with a lower score, you can still get in.\nKeep reading to learn how.\nHow important are LSAT scores for law school admissions?\nIt\u2019s true that a higher score will increase your chances of acceptance into the law school of your choice.\nTypically, a score that falls within the 150 range is considered average. While it will get you accepted into most law schools, it could make it difficult to stand out.\nA score of at least 160 is considered strong, and most law schools have median scores within this range. However, keep in mind that scholarships may require higher scores.\nLast but not least, a score of 170 or more puts you comfortably among the top 2-3% of test-takers and will certainly get the attention of some of the best law schools in the country.\nBut I want to let you in on a secret: Your admission doesn\u2019t hinge solely on your LSAT score.\nYour\u00a0undergraduate GPA\u00a0also plays a part in it.\nAccording to the ABA,\u00a0the average GPA among admitted law school students\u00a0is around 3.6. But just like LSAT scores, that average varies across schools.\nAmong students who get into top-tier law schools like the ones mentioned earlier, the average GPA is 3.8 or higher.\nWhile both your GPA and LSAT scores are important factors in determining how successful you would be as a law school student, schools tend to weigh the LSAT more heavily.\nBut even if you score a couple of points lower than the median LSAT score or GPA at your number one school of choice, don\u2019t let it keep you from applying.\nThe law school admission process is a holistic one, which means that they\u2019ll look at more than just your score.\nIt all comes down to being able to prove you have what it takes to succeed as a law student in your application. With the right strategy, application elements like your personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation will help you stand out.\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on average LSAT scores and the kind of scores needed for top schools, let\u2019s move on to the three different types of LSAT scores.\nHow does LSAT work?\u00a0\nWhen talking about LSAT scores, most people only talk about the numbers, like 150, 170, or 180.\nBut there are actually\u00a0three\u00a0types of LSAT scores you should be aware of.\nThe first is called the raw score. Your raw score reflects the number of questions you answered correctly on the test.\nFor instance, if an LSAT was made up of 100 questions and you got 85 correct, you would score an 85.\nThe second type of score is a scaled score, which is the kind of score you\u2019re probably most familiar with.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0the kind of score that reads 150, 170, or 180.\u00a0\nA scaled score is what you get when you convert your raw score into an LSAT score based on the Score Conversion Chart. In this chart, scores range from 120 to 180.\nFinally, there\u2019s a percentile score, which shows how well you tested compared to others who have taken the LSAT over the last three years.\u00a0\nNext steps\nThere you have it! Everything you need to know about what makes for a good LSAT score.\nDon\u2019t let the pressure of a high LSAT score keep you from trying.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right kind of application strategy.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve worked with several students who have scored well beneath the median and still gone on to receive admission letters.\nIf you want to make sure you\u2019re a top candidate, sign up for my\u00a0on-demand workshop today.

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

The C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health asked a national sample of parents of children in middle and high school about participation in school activities.\nParents reported that over 80% of their middle and high school-age children would participate in at least one type of school activity for the 2018-19 school year, including 52% in sports, 43% in arts activities, and 51% clubs/other activities. Nearly half (46%) of middle and high school-age children were expected to participate in more than one type of school activity.\nRequired school participation fees averaged $161 for sports, $86 for arts, and $46 for clubs/other activities. For sports, 18% of students had school participation fees of $200 or more, compared to 12% for arts and 5% for clubs/other activities; there was little difference between middle and high school fees. In contrast, more students had a participation fee of $0 for arts (64%) or clubs (66%) compared to sports (46%). When combining participation fees with other expenses such as equipment and travel, the total cost averaged $408 for sports, $251 for arts, and $126 for clubs/other activities.\nNearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school activities is higher than they expected. Ten percent of parents felt the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost, including three times as many lower-income parents (18% less than $50,000 vs 6% more than $100,000). Only 7% of parents had ever requested a waiver or scholarship for participation fees; 19% said they didn\u2019t know how, and 5% were not comfortable making such a request.\nParents reported that 18% of their middle and high school-age children would not participate in any school activities in 2018-19. Non-participation was higher among boys than girls (21% vs 15%), and for students from lower-income households (25% less than $50,000 vs 12% over $100,000). Reasons for non-participation cited more often for boys were cost, transportation, and having a job; not being interested in activities was cited more often for girls. Non-participation was three times higher for children of parents who said the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost, and nearly twice as high for children of parents who said the cost of school activities is more than they expected.\nHighlights\nImplications\nSchool activities offer an array of benefits to middle and high school students: opportunities to explore different interests, make new friends, hone an existing skill or talent, and develop leadership and teamwork skills. Participation in school activities is linked to higher educational achievement.\nParticipation in school activities is widespread. According to parents responding to this Mott Poll, over 80% of their middle or high school students are participating in a school activity for the 2018-19 school year. These activities range from exploratory options like intramurals sports or afterschool clubs, to higher-intensity options like varsity sports, competition arts groups, or student council.\nMany school activities have a fee to participate, and those fees can be a barrier to participation. Most schools strive to offer a range of activities, including some with no fees; in addition, many schools provide scholarships or waivers to assist students with fees. Despite these efforts, elevated rates of non-participation among lower-income students continues to be a problem, as noted in our earlier reports from 2012, 2015, and 2016.\nIn this Mott Poll, 1 in 6 students (18%) at both the middle and high school level are not participating in any school activities for the 2018-19 school year. The income gap persists, as students from households earning less than $100,000 have twice the level of non-participation as their peers from wealthier households.\nTwo key parent attitudes that may explain some of the discrepancy. Nearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school extracurricular activities is higher than they expected, and 10% of parents said the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost. The children of parents who express either of these attitudes are less likely to participate in school activities.\nParents concerned about cost may not be aware of no-cost activities or knowledgeable about fee waivers. Only 7% of parents who responded to this Mott Poll had ever requested a waiver or scholarship for participation fees. In contrast, nearly one quarter of parents were \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d for assistance: those who didn\u2019t know about waivers (19%) and those who were not comfortable requesting one (5%). School officials can address the ongoing problem of non-participation by informing students and parents about no-cost activities, as well as waivers and scholarship options, and by emphasizing the benefits of school activities to parents who may be hesitant.\nThis Mott Poll also highlights the continuing trend of sports being more expensive than other types of school activities. The average participation fee was substantially higher for sports than for arts or clubs, as was the total cost of participation, with little difference between middle and high school costs. Also concerning are trends over time. A previous report for the 2015-16 school year found an average sports participation fee of $139; that average fee increased to $161 in this current Mott Poll Report, while the average fees for arts and clubs did not increase. The same pattern occurs for total costs. Moreover, no-cost options continue to be less common for sports than for arts and clubs.\nThe higher costs of sports, compared to other activities, may be contributing to the higher level of non-participation among boys. Boys have slightly greater participation in sports activities overall compared to girls (53% vs 49%), and more boys than girls participate in sports only (21% vs 10%). Thus, the disproportionately higher cost of sports may be more likely to impact boys.\nData Source & Methods\nThis report presents findings from a nationally representative household survey conducted exclusively by GfK Custom Research, LLC (GfK), for C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital. The survey was administered in October 2018 to a randomly selected, stratified group of parents age 18 and older (n=2,007). Adults were selected from GfK\u2019s web-enabled KnowledgePanel\u00ae that closely resembles the U.S. population. The sample was subsequently weighted to reflect population figures from the Census Bureau. The survey completion rate was 60% among panel members contacted to participate. This report is based on responses from 961 parents who reported on 1,323 children in middle or high school. The margin of error is \u00b11 to 6 percentage points.\nFindings from the C.S.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Pay-to-participate: Impact on school activities\n\nSchool extracurricular activities boost educational achievement and personal development, but participation barriers exist. The C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health surveyed parents of middle and high school students about participation in school activities.\n\nParents reported that over 80% of their children would participate in at least one school activity for the 2018-19 school year: 52% in sports, 43% in arts, and 51% in clubs/other activities. Nearly half (46%) were expected to participate in more than one type of activity.\n\nRequired school participation fees averaged $161 for sports, $86 for arts, and $46 for clubs/other activities. For sports, 18% of students had fees of $200 or more, compared to 12% for arts and 5% for clubs. More students had a participation fee of $0 for arts (64%) or clubs (66%) compared to sports (46%). Total costs, including equipment and travel, averaged $408 for sports, $251 for arts, and $126 for clubs.\n\nNearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school activities is higher than expected. Ten percent felt the benefits are not worth the cost, with lower-income parents (18% less than $50,000 vs 6% more than $100,000) more likely to feel this way. Only 7% of parents had requested a waiver or scholarship; 19% didn\u2019t know how, and 5% were uncomfortable making such a request.\n\nParents reported that 18% of their children would not participate in any school activities in 2018-19. Non-participation was higher among boys (21% vs 15%) and lower-income students (25% less than $50,000 vs 12% over $100,000). Reasons for non-participation included cost, transportation, and having a job for boys, and lack of interest for girls. Non-participation was higher for children of parents who felt the benefits are not worth the cost or that the cost is higher than expected.\n\nSchool activities offer benefits such as exploring interests, making friends, and developing skills. Participation is linked to higher educational achievement. Over 80% of students participate in activities, ranging from intramural sports to varsity sports and student council.\n\nMany activities have fees, which can be a barrier. Schools offer no-fee activities and provide scholarships or waivers, but non-participation among lower-income students remains a problem. In this poll, 18% of students are not participating, with lower-income students having twice the non-participation rate of wealthier peers.\n\nParents\u2019 attitudes about cost impact participation. Nearly 3 in 10 parents said costs are higher than expected, and 10% said benefits are not worth the cost. Children of these parents are less likely to participate. Only 7% of parents requested waivers, while nearly a quarter missed opportunities for assistance.\n\nSports are more expensive than other activities, with higher participation fees and total costs. The average sports fee increased from $139 in 2015-16 to $161 in this poll, while fees for arts and clubs did not increase. No-cost options are less common for sports.\n\nHigher sports costs may contribute to higher non-participation among boys, who participate in sports more than girls (53% vs 49%) and are more likely to participate in sports only (21% vs 10%).\n\nThis report is based on a nationally representative survey conducted by GfK Custom Research for C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital in October 2018. The survey included 2,007 parents, with responses from 961 parents about 1,323 children in middle or high school. The margin of error is \u00b11 to 6 percentage points.\n\nFindings do not represent the opinions of the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan reserves all rights over this material.",

High efficiency is crucial to achieve a desirable driving range while using a limited amount of energy in batteries. Basically, you can make a fast EV or one with great range, but if it's bad at efficiency, you won't see the benefits you want.\u00a0\nIn today's post, we'll take a look at a list of EPA energy consumption results\u2014Combined, City and Highway\u2014for U.S.-market battery-electric vehicles. The EPA results are not perfect, but they remain the only common measure for all EVs on the market.\nThere are more than 300 individual EV configurations on sale, including different battery sizes, ranges, powertrain setups, and wheels\u2014all of which directly affect energy consumption. We collected numbers for about 200 configurations, for which data were available\u2014listed directly by EPA, or by the manufacturers. (There is an asterisk in such cases, just like when we applied numbers from the previous model year of an EV.)\nNo Tesla Models For 2024, Yet\nUpdate March 1, 2024: We should note that at the moment, this\u00a0chart is lacking some of the popular models\u2014including the Tesla lineup\u2014because they unfortunately are not yet listed on the EPA website. We will include them in the future.\nHistorically, Tesla models have been rated as highly efficient, boasting\u00a0276 Wh/mi (172 Wh/km) for the Model Y Long Range AWD. We expect them to be very competitive when the data comes in.\nWe've included models that are currently available for order or reservation, some upcoming models, and a few that have been discontinued but may still be found on dealer lots as reference points.\nThe Stats\nThe EPA provides fuel economy numbers in MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent), assuming that one gallon of gasoline is 33.7 kWh of energy. This unit was created to have a kind of comparison to the MPG rating, used for internal combustion engine cars. It basically measures the equivalent amount of energy consumed when compared to a gasoline vehicle.\nHowever, because EVs are using electricity, it's better to operate using Wh or kWh as a metric. That's simply because the battery stores a certain number of kWh of energy. (The MPGe metric has been criticized for not being easy to understand or very relevant.)\u00a0\nIn our charts, we used the EPA Combined energy consumption numbers in miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh), as well as in watt-hours per mile (Wh/mi). Both have white color text. Additionally, we also have Wh/mi numbers for EPA City (green) and EPA Highway (yellow.)\nWhile the mi/kWh metric might be more intuitive for some reasons, the Wh/mi is also handy and allows to quickly calculate the amount of energy, the vehicle will use during a month or a year, when assuming a certain mileage. For example, a vehicle with 300 Wh/mi energy consumption needs 3,000 kWh per 10,000 miles.\nA very important thing to note is that all the EPA figures include the charging losses, usually at least several percent of the total amount.\nAccording to the data, the average energy consumption for the 200 EVs listed below is 2.6 mi/kWh (381 Wh/mi). The highway numbers are over 5% worse, while the city numbers are some 4.5% better. About half of all vehicle configurations sits between 2.5-3.3 mi/kWh (300-400 Wh/mi).\nBest Energy Consumption EVs\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6\n2024 Lucid Air Pure RWD\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 6 (SE trim) with rear-wheel drive, a 77.4-kilowatt-hour battery and 18-inch wheels has the best EPA Combined energy consumption number of 140 MPGe or 4.2 mi/kWh (241 Wh/mi), including charging losses. One of the key elements to achieve such a high result is outstanding aerodynamics and a high-voltage battery system (697 volts nominal).\nThe second best is the Lucid Air Pure, rear-wheel drive with 19-inch wheels. It has a rating of 137 MPGe or 4.1 mi/kWh (246 Wh/mi). It's worth noting that the Lucid Air is the most efficient car on the market in the EPA Highway category (251 Wh/mi compared to 265 Wh/mi in the case of the Hyundai Ioniq 6). This is also a tremendous achievement considering the size, weight, battery capacity, range and performance of Lucid Air cars.\nOne of the biggest surprises is that the third model on the list is the new entry-level Lexus RZ 300e. According to the manufacturer, it is good for 125 MPGe or 3.7 mi/kWh (270 Wh/mi).\nHigh in the ranking are also some versions of the BMW i4 (eDrive35), the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EV/Bolt EUV duo, Toyota bZ4X, Kia EV6, Hyundai Kona Electric, Polestar 2 (Long Range Single Motor), Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia Niro EV, Volkswagen ID.4 and Tesla Model 3 (the latest version is not yet listed by the EPA).\nRoughly about 10% of the best EV configurations gets results better than 300 Wh/mi (more than 3.3 mi/kWh).\nWorst Energy Consumption EVs\nOn the other end of the spectrum, we usually can find large and heavy electric vehicles with multi-motor powertrains. They consume up to about three times more energy than the most efficient electric cars, according to EPA.\nThe worst result belongs to the Lordstown Endurance pickup, which was rated just before the company went bankrupt. With just 48 MPGe or 1.4 mi/kWh (702 Wh/mi), the vehicle sits at the bottom of the list.\nThe GMC Hummer EV Pickup and GMC Hummer EV SUV (20 battery module version) are also electron guzzlers with 50-53 MPGe, depending on the wheels/tires (Mud-Terrain MT or All-Terrain AT). The results are as low as 1.5 mi/kWh or 674 Wh/mi, and goes up to 749 Wh/mi to an absolute worst result in EPA Highway category. However, considering the size, weight and performance, this EV is still tremendously more efficient than an ICE counterpart.\nThere are GMC Hummer EV Pickups with 24 battery modules. As we understand, they are too heavy to qualify for EPA energy consumption tests (a heavy-duty pickup category). Their results potentially are even worse than the mentioned 20BM versions.\nAmong the EVs with the highest energy consumption, we can also see the quad-motor Rivians, some Chevrolet Silverado EV and Ford F-150 Lightning, and the sporty Audi SQ8 e-tron.\nLordstown Endurance\nGMC Hummer EV Pickup\nEV Energy Consumption Chart\nThe chart below helps us to better illustrate the difference between the models (according to EPA methodology), and the difference between the city and highway driving for a particular model.\nIt's just a general comparison and the only consistent one we have for the entire market. In some cases, the results might be different than real-world tests\u2014especially the Audi e-tron GT/Porsche Taycan family, which generally have better real-world results than their EPA tests indicate.\nThis chart was last updated Feb. 21, 2024. It will be updated as the year goes on.\u00a0\nClick here to see an expanded version of this chart.\n*Values according to the manufacturer or estimated (borrowed from the previous model year)\nInfo and exceptions:\nSee also\nTrending\nlatest articles\nlatest articles\nAbout this article\n",

    "Document3": "The longest-range plug-in hybrids\nLike the idea of a plug-in hybrid car, but want to spend as much time as possible on electric power? Here are the top 10 models with the longest electric ranges...\nIf you need a car to help minimise your fuel costs, a plug-in hybrid\u00a0(PHEV) can make a lot of sense. That\u2019s because they essentially offer the best of both worlds;\u00a0combining a combustion engine with an\u00a0electric motor and a battery to give you the option of running on electric power\u00a0for\u00a0short\u00a0journeys, and the engine on longer ones.\nSo, if you regularly cover a 30-mile round trip to work or to drop your kids off at school, for example, a PHEV could be the ideal choice for you. A PHEV can also be a good option if you're a company car driver, because\u00a0their often\u00a0low official CO2 emissions\u00a0result in low benefit-in-kind (BIK) ratings.\nSo,\u00a0which plug-in hybrids have the longest\u00a0electric-only ranges? Here, we name\u00a0the top 10 cars,\u00a0and reveal\u00a0how much you can save on each with our\u00a0Target Price\u00a0deal and\u00a0free\u00a0New Car Deals\u00a0service. In each case, we've used the official WLTP electric-only ranges of each model, although we have also revealed real-world range figures where appropriate.\nIf you want to know which car has the longest official electric-only range, that would be the Range Rover Sport P460e and Mercedes GLC 300e \u2013 both cars have identical official range figures. However, if neither of those cars are to your taste, there are plenty of other cars on this list that aren't too far behind them.\u00a0\nRange Rover Sport\nOur pick: 3.0 D300 Dynamic SE 5dr Auto\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0P460e Dynamic SE\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a392,980\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a390,425 | Electric-only range\u00a075 miles\nThe silence offered by electric motor in the Range Rover Sport P460e makes it one of the most refined plug-in hybrids out there. Not only that, but the enormous\u00a0official electric-only range of 75 miles means you can maximise the serenity more than you can in the BMW X5 xDrive50e, which can manage 62 miles.\u00a0\nHaving said that, a range of around 50 miles is more likely in the real world, although that's still longer than what you get officially in\u00a0the Lexus RX 450h+ (43 miles). When\u00a0the 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine does eventually kick\u00a0in, it's incredibly quiet and smooth, and you'll hardly even notice it.\nOf course, being a Range Rover, the interior is as beautiful to look at as it is to touch, while the seats are comfortable and supportive. You also feel slightly more hunkered down in the Sport compared with its bigger Range Rover brother, thanks to the raised centre console.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Range Rover Sport review\nMercedes GLC\nOur pick: GLC 220d 4Matic AMG Line 5dr 9G-Tronic\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0GLC 300e AMG Line\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a363,210\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a361,210 | Electric-only range\u00a075 miles\nAll versions of the latest GLC offer a comfortable ride and an interior that's filled\u00a0with tech, but the GLC 300e\u00a0also gives you one of\u00a0the longest official ranges of any plug-in hybrid. At 75 miles, its range is\u00a0almost double that of its closest competitor, the Lexus NX 450h+.\nHaving tested those two cars\u00a0back-to-back in the real-world, we found the GLC managed a healthy 57 miles before running out of charge in our real world test. The NX, by comparison, managed 30 miles in the same conditions (versus 43 miles officially).\nPerformance is\u00a0respectable\u00a0in the GLC 300e, with\u00a00-62mph taking\u00a06.4sec. However, the petrol engine is rather grumbly when it fires up, and you do feel the extra weight of the battery in the corners\u00a0compared with non-PHEV versions.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes GLC review\nRange Rover\nOur pick: 3.0 D300 SE 4dr Auto\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0P460e\u00a0SE\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a3115,585\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a3115,585 | Electric-only range\u00a074 miles\nThe Range Rover takes luxury to the next level, with its commanding driving position, effortless\u00a0performance\u00a0and\u00a0super-soft\u00a0ride making it the ultimate long-distance cruiser.\nLike the Range Rover Sport, the P460e plug-in hybrid version\u00a0is a great option if you want to do big miles on electric-only power, with it only travelling\u00a0one less mile officially between charges than its sibling. Despite that, it can still travel much farther than\u00a0the\u00a0Bentley Bentayga PHEV (28 miles).\nWhere the Range Rover wins back some points compared with the Sport\u00a0is with the long-wheelbase version, because it's available with\u00a0seven seats (the Sport isn't). So, if you want a seven-seater PHEV that does big miles on electricity, then the Range Rover is a great option. You will have to exchange a big sum of cash\u00a0for it, though.\u00a0\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Range Rover\u00a0review\nMercedes C-Class\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0C300e AMG Line Premium\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a355,025\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a353,025 | Electric-only range\u00a066 miles\nThe Mercedes C-Class C300e has the longest official electric-only range of any PHEV\u00a0executive car, with a figure that's significantly longer\u00a0than that of its closest rival, the BMW 3 Series 33oe (37 miles).\nHowever, it's not just the\u00a0electric range that appeals, because the C-Class is one of the more comfortable executive cars. That's helped by the fact that the C300e gets rear air suspension as standard (to help cope with the extra weight of the battery), which does a\u00a0good job of keeping the car level over bumpy roads. It's a similar story with non-PHEV versions, which are also very comfortable.\nEven though the interior quality isn't as good as what you'll find in\u00a0the 3 Series, the design is slick and the infotainment system is relatively easy to use. It's just a shame there are minimal physical controls for operating certain functions, such as the climate controls.\u00a0\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes C-Class review\nMercedes E-Class\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion E300e AMG Line Premium\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a370,900\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a370,900 | Electric-only range\u00a065\u00a0miles\nIt may be an expensive option, but the Mercedes E-Class E300e is a brilliant\u00a0PHEV executive car. That's helped by the fact that it's well appointed and spacious inside, which makes\u00a0it a great option for carrying passengers.\nThe hybrid system itself is also very impressive.\u00a0It has a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol\u00a0engine and\u00a0an electric motor\u00a0that generates a combined output of 328bhp (making it the quickest\u00a0E-Class available), while the\u00a025.4kWh (usable) battery delivers an official range of 65 miles. While this is big battery pays dividends when it comes to range, the downside\u00a0is\u00a0that it\u00a0eats into boot space, with only 370 litres of capacity as opposed to 540 litres with the mild hybrid models.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes E-Class review\nMercedes C-Class Estate\nOur pick: C220d AMG Line 5dr 9G-Tronic\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion C300e AMG Line Premium Plus |\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a360,585\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a360,585 | Electric-only range\u00a064\u00a0miles\nThe Mercedes C-Class Estate C300e\u00a0has the longest official electric-only range of any PHEV estate car.\u00a0This is partly thanks to its large\u00a025.4kWh (usable) battery, which it shares with the saloon. As a result, it can travel farther than the Mercedes E-Class Estate E300e, BMW 330e Touring and Audi A6 Avant TFSIe.\u00a0\nWhile the\u00a0AMG Line Premium Plus trim is\u00a0pricey (it's\u00a0the only trim level available\u00a0with the\u00a0C300e), it does give you all the kit you could ever need, including\u00a0three-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, a\u00a0Burmester sound system and a head-up display. The interior is smart to look at and\u00a0filled\u00a0with the latest tech, too.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes C-Class Estate review\nMercedes E-Class Estate\nOur pick: E300e AMG Line Premium 5dr 9G-Tronic [Pan Roof]\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion E300e AMG Line Premium |\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a373,150\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a373,150 | Electric-only range\u00a063\u00a0miles\nThe Mercedes E-Class Estate E300e shares its hybrid system with the E-Class saloon, and as a result it has an equally long\u00a0electric-only range, making it a brilliant option if you want a company car with a big boot. That said, the\u00a0location of the battery beneath the boot floor means the loading area\u00a0is higher than on non-PHEV versions, cutting capacity to 460 litres. However, this is similar to\u00a0rivals.\nPerhaps the best thing about the E300e, though, is the\u00a0ride. Like all the regular versions, it comes with\u00a0air suspension on the rear axle, helping keep the back end well\u00a0controlled over bumps\u00a0\u2013 even when you\u2019re carrying\u00a0a boot full of luggage.

With a 0-62mph time of just 5.2 seconds, it's properly quick, although the acceleration isn\u2019t as\u00a0sprightly in electric mode. That said,\u00a0there's plenty of oomph for rush-hour traffic and\u00a0reaching motorway speeds.\nSpeaking of motorways, the\u00a0S-Class's ride\u00a0is exemplary at high speeds, and the air suspension\u00a0irons out dips and crests exceptionally well.

    "Document1": "2024 U.S. Electric Cars Listed From Lowest To Highest Energy Consumption\n The Hyundai Ioniq 6, Lucid Air and Lexus RZ are your energy consumption champions. \nOutstanding energy consumption numbers are one of the key features of electric vehicles. High efficiency is crucial to achieve a desirable driving range while using a limited amount of energy in batteries. Basically, you can make a fast EV or one with great range, but if it's bad at efficiency, you won't see the benefits you want.\u00a0\nIn today's post, we'll take a look at a list of EPA energy consumption results\u2014Combined, City and Highway\u2014for U.S.-market battery-electric vehicles. The EPA results are not perfect, but they remain the only common measure for all EVs on the market.\nThere are more than 300 individual EV configurations on sale, including different battery sizes, ranges, powertrain setups, and wheels\u2014all of which directly affect energy consumption. We collected numbers for about 200 configurations, for which data were available\u2014listed directly by EPA, or by the manufacturers. (There is an asterisk in such cases, just like when we applied numbers from the previous model year of an EV.)\nNo Tesla Models For 2024, Yet\nUpdate March 1, 2024: We should note that at the moment, this\u00a0chart is lacking some of the popular models\u2014including the Tesla lineup\u2014because they unfortunately are not yet listed on the EPA website. We will include them in the future.\nHistorically, Tesla models have been rated as highly efficient, boasting\u00a0276 Wh/mi (172 Wh/km) for the Model Y Long Range AWD. We expect them to be very competitive when the data comes in.\nWe've included models that are currently available for order or reservation, some upcoming models, and a few that have been discontinued but may still be found on dealer lots as reference points.\nThe Stats\nThe EPA provides fuel economy numbers in MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent), assuming that one gallon of gasoline is 33.7 kWh of energy. This unit was created to have a kind of comparison to the MPG rating, used for internal combustion engine cars. It basically measures the equivalent amount of energy consumed when compared to a gasoline vehicle.\nHowever, because EVs are using electricity, it's better to operate using Wh or kWh as a metric. That's simply because the battery stores a certain number of kWh of energy. (The MPGe metric has been criticized for not being easy to understand or very relevant.)\u00a0\nIn our charts, we used the EPA Combined energy consumption numbers in miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh), as well as in watt-hours per mile (Wh/mi). Both have white color text. Additionally, we also have Wh/mi numbers for EPA City (green) and EPA Highway (yellow.)\nWhile the mi/kWh metric might be more intuitive for some reasons, the Wh/mi is also handy and allows to quickly calculate the amount of energy, the vehicle will use during a month or a year, when assuming a certain mileage. For example, a vehicle with 300 Wh/mi energy consumption needs 3,000 kWh per 10,000 miles.\nA very important thing to note is that all the EPA figures include the charging losses, usually at least several percent of the total amount.\nAccording to the data, the average energy consumption for the 200 EVs listed below is 2.6 mi/kWh (381 Wh/mi). The highway numbers are over 5% worse, while the city numbers are some 4.5% better. About half of all vehicle configurations sits between 2.5-3.3 mi/kWh (300-400 Wh/mi).\nBest Energy Consumption EVs\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6\n2024 Lucid Air Pure RWD\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 6 (SE trim) with rear-wheel drive, a 77.4-kilowatt-hour battery and 18-inch wheels has the best EPA Combined energy consumption number of 140 MPGe or 4.2 mi/kWh (241 Wh/mi), including charging losses. One of the key elements to achieve such a high result is outstanding aerodynamics and a high-voltage battery system (697 volts nominal).\nThe second best is the Lucid Air Pure, rear-wheel drive with 19-inch wheels. It has a rating of 137 MPGe or 4.1 mi/kWh (246 Wh/mi). It's worth noting that the Lucid Air is the most efficient car on the market in the EPA Highway category (251 Wh/mi compared to 265 Wh/mi in the case of the Hyundai Ioniq 6). This is also a tremendous achievement considering the size, weight, battery capacity, range and performance of Lucid Air cars.\nOne of the biggest surprises is that the third model on the list is the new entry-level Lexus RZ 300e. According to the manufacturer, it is good for 125 MPGe or 3.7 mi/kWh (270 Wh/mi).\nHigh in the ranking are also some versions of the BMW i4 (eDrive35), the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EV/Bolt EUV duo, Toyota bZ4X, Kia EV6, Hyundai Kona Electric, Polestar 2 (Long Range Single Motor), Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia Niro EV, Volkswagen ID.4 and Tesla Model 3 (the latest version is not yet listed by the EPA).\nRoughly about 10% of the best EV configurations gets results better than 300 Wh/mi (more than 3.3 mi/kWh).\nWorst Energy Consumption EVs\nOn the other end of the spectrum, we usually can find large and heavy electric vehicles with multi-motor powertrains. They consume up to about three times more energy than the most efficient electric cars, according to EPA.\nThe worst result belongs to the Lordstown Endurance pickup, which was rated just before the company went bankrupt. With just 48 MPGe or 1.4 mi/kWh (702 Wh/mi), the vehicle sits at the bottom of the list.\nThe GMC Hummer EV Pickup and GMC Hummer EV SUV (20 battery module version) are also electron guzzlers with 50-53 MPGe, depending on the wheels/tires (Mud-Terrain MT or All-Terrain AT). The results are as low as 1.5 mi/kWh or 674 Wh/mi, and goes up to 749 Wh/mi to an absolute worst result in EPA Highway category. However, considering the size, weight and performance, this EV is still tremendously more efficient than an ICE counterpart.\nThere are GMC Hummer EV Pickups with 24 battery modules. As we understand, they are too heavy to qualify for EPA energy consumption tests (a heavy-duty pickup category).

    "Document2": "The longest-range plug-in hybrids\nLike the idea of a plug-in hybrid car, but want to spend as much time as possible on electric power? Here are the top 10 models with the longest electric ranges...\nIf you need a car to help minimise your fuel costs, a plug-in hybrid\u00a0(PHEV) can make a lot of sense. That\u2019s because they essentially offer the best of both worlds;\u00a0combining a combustion engine with an\u00a0electric motor and a battery to give you the option of running on electric power\u00a0for\u00a0short\u00a0journeys, and the engine on longer ones.\nSo, if you regularly cover a 30-mile round trip to work or to drop your kids off at school, for example, a PHEV could be the ideal choice for you. A PHEV can also be a good option if you're a company car driver, because\u00a0their often\u00a0low official CO2 emissions\u00a0result in low benefit-in-kind (BIK) ratings.\nSo,\u00a0which plug-in hybrids have the longest\u00a0electric-only ranges? Here, we name\u00a0the top 10 cars,\u00a0and reveal\u00a0how much you can save on each with our\u00a0Target Price\u00a0deal and\u00a0free\u00a0New Car Deals\u00a0service. In each case, we've used the official WLTP electric-only ranges of each model, although we have also revealed real-world range figures where appropriate.\nIf you want to know which car has the longest official electric-only range, that would be the Range Rover Sport P460e and Mercedes GLC 300e \u2013 both cars have identical official range figures. However, if neither of those cars are to your taste, there are plenty of other cars on this list that aren't too far behind them.\u00a0\nRange Rover Sport\nOur pick: 3.0 D300 Dynamic SE 5dr Auto\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0P460e Dynamic SE\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a392,980\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a390,425 | Electric-only range\u00a075 miles\nThe silence offered by electric motor in the Range Rover Sport P460e makes it one of the most refined plug-in hybrids out there. Not only that, but the enormous\u00a0official electric-only range of 75 miles means you can maximise the serenity more than you can in the BMW X5 xDrive50e, which can manage 62 miles.\u00a0\nHaving said that, a range of around 50 miles is more likely in the real world, although that's still longer than what you get officially in\u00a0the Lexus RX 450h+ (43 miles). When\u00a0the 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine does eventually kick\u00a0in, it's incredibly quiet and smooth, and you'll hardly even notice it.\nOf course, being a Range Rover, the interior is as beautiful to look at as it is to touch, while the seats are comfortable and supportive. You also feel slightly more hunkered down in the Sport compared with its bigger Range Rover brother, thanks to the raised centre console.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Range Rover Sport review\nMercedes GLC\nOur pick: GLC 220d 4Matic AMG Line 5dr 9G-Tronic\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0GLC 300e AMG Line\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a363,210\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a361,210 | Electric-only range\u00a075 miles\nAll versions of the latest GLC offer a comfortable ride and an interior that's filled\u00a0with tech, but the GLC 300e\u00a0also gives you one of\u00a0the longest official ranges of any plug-in hybrid. At 75 miles, its range is\u00a0almost double that of its closest competitor, the Lexus NX 450h+.\nHaving tested those two cars\u00a0back-to-back in the real-world, we found the GLC managed a healthy 57 miles before running out of charge in our real world test. The NX, by comparison, managed 30 miles in the same conditions (versus 43 miles officially).\nPerformance is\u00a0respectable\u00a0in the GLC 300e, with\u00a00-62mph taking\u00a06.4sec. However, the petrol engine is rather grumbly when it fires up, and you do feel the extra weight of the battery in the corners\u00a0compared with non-PHEV versions.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes GLC review\nRange Rover\nOur pick: 3.0 D300 SE 4dr Auto\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0P460e\u00a0SE\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a3115,585\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a3115,585 | Electric-only range\u00a074 miles\nThe Range Rover takes luxury to the next level, with its commanding driving position, effortless\u00a0performance\u00a0and\u00a0super-soft\u00a0ride making it the ultimate long-distance cruiser.\nLike the Range Rover Sport, the P460e plug-in hybrid version\u00a0is a great option if you want to do big miles on electric-only power, with it only travelling\u00a0one less mile officially between charges than its sibling. Despite that, it can still travel much farther than\u00a0the\u00a0Bentley Bentayga PHEV (28 miles).\nWhere the Range Rover wins back some points compared with the Sport\u00a0is with the long-wheelbase version, because it's available with\u00a0seven seats (the Sport isn't). So, if you want a seven-seater PHEV that does big miles on electricity, then the Range Rover is a great option. You will have to exchange a big sum of cash\u00a0for it, though.\u00a0\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Range Rover\u00a0review\nMercedes C-Class\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0C300e AMG Line Premium\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a355,025\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a353,025 | Electric-only range\u00a066 miles\nThe Mercedes C-Class C300e has the longest official electric-only range of any PHEV\u00a0executive car, with a figure that's significantly longer\u00a0than that of its closest rival, the BMW 3 Series 33oe (37 miles).\nHowever, it's not just the\u00a0electric range that appeals, because the C-Class is one of the more comfortable executive cars. That's helped by the fact that the C300e gets rear air suspension as standard (to help cope with the extra weight of the battery), which does a\u00a0good job of keeping the car level over bumpy roads. It's a similar story with non-PHEV versions, which are also very comfortable.\nEven though the interior quality isn't as good as what you'll find in\u00a0the 3 Series, the design is slick and the infotainment system is relatively easy to use. It's just a shame there are minimal physical controls for operating certain functions, such as the climate controls.\u00a0\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes C-Class review\nMercedes E-Class\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion E300e AMG Line Premium\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a370,900\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a370,900 | Electric-only range\u00a065\u00a0miles\nIt may be an expensive option, but the Mercedes E-Class E300e is a brilliant\u00a0PHEV executive car. That's helped by the fact that it's well appointed and spacious inside, which makes\u00a0it a great option for carrying passengers.\nThe hybrid system itself is also very impressive.\u00a0It has a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol\u00a0engine and\u00a0an electric motor\u00a0that generates a combined output of 328bhp (making it the quickest\u00a0E-Class available), while the\u00a025.4kWh (usable) battery delivers an official range of 65 miles. While this is big battery pays dividends when it comes to range, the downside\u00a0is\u00a0that it\u00a0eats into boot space, with only 370 litres of capacity as opposed to 540 litres with the mild hybrid models.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes E-Class review\nMercedes C-Class Estate\nOur pick: C220d AMG Line 5dr 9G-Tronic\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion C300e AMG Line Premium Plus |\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a360,585\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a360,585 | Electric-only range\u00a064\u00a0miles\nThe Mercedes C-Class Estate C300e\u00a0has the longest official electric-only range of any PHEV estate car.\u00a0This is partly thanks to its large\u00a025.4kWh (usable) battery, which it shares with the saloon. As a result, it can travel farther than the Mercedes E-Class Estate E300e, BMW 330e Touring and Audi A6 Avant TFSIe.\u00a0\nWhile the\u00a0AMG Line Premium Plus trim is\u00a0pricey (it's\u00a0the only trim level available\u00a0with the\u00a0C300e), it does give you all the kit you could ever need, including\u00a0three-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, a\u00a0Burmester sound system and a head-up display.

That said, the\u00a0location of the battery beneath the boot floor means the loading area\u00a0is higher than on non-PHEV versions, cutting capacity to 460 litres. However, this is similar to\u00a0rivals.\nPerhaps the best thing about the E300e, though, is the\u00a0ride. Like all the regular versions, it comes with\u00a0air suspension on the rear axle, helping keep the back end well\u00a0controlled over bumps\u00a0\u2013 even when you\u2019re carrying\u00a0a boot full of luggage.

With a 0-62mph time of just 5.2 seconds, it's properly quick, although the acceleration isn\u2019t as\u00a0sprightly in electric mode. That said,\u00a0there's plenty of oomph for rush-hour traffic and\u00a0reaching motorway speeds.\nSpeaking of motorways, the\u00a0S-Class's ride\u00a0is exemplary at high speeds, and the air suspension\u00a0irons out dips and crests exceptionally well.

That's more than the Audi A6 TFSIe\u00a0(34 miles), but less than\u00a0the Mercedes E-Class E300e (65 miles).\nIf you want more power, there's also the 550e version. It gets a 3.0-litre petrol engine and a boost in performance (0-62mph takes 4.3sec as opposed to 6.3sec), but it can't travel quite as far as the 530e on electric-only power\u00a0(55 miles).

Average fuel economy for light-duty vehicles has improved from approximately 13.1 miles per gallon (mpg) in 1975 to 25.3 mpg in 2021, with dramatic initial gains, a 17-year decline, and since 2005 significant though slowing improvement again. During this period, passenger cars experienced impressive growth in horsepower. The second chart shows the improvement in real-world miles per gallon of several different light duty vehicle types.\nThe Biden administration has begun to make up for stalled progress by putting in place new fuel standards that will require carmakers to achieve average fuel efficiencies of 49 miles per gallon. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has taken an even more aggressive route, requiring all vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.\n47\nInternational Fuel Economy Standards and Targets\nSource: ICCT (2022)\nThe U.S. has set aggressive new the fuel economy standards. In 2022, it has only the second most stringent standards, after Brazil. other countries are further along in strengthening fuel economy targets for their own fleets. By 2025, U.S. fuel standards fall behind China and New Zealand. The European Union is considering net-zero fuel standards by 2035, the strongest of any other country. Their regulations will likely have important impacts for U.S. competitiveness in the auto market, as well as for U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and energy use overall.\n48\nMedium and Heavy-Duty Modes\nSource: EIA (2022), Annual Energy Outlook 2022\nSource: EPA (2022)\nSource: AFDC (2020), Average Fuel Economy by Vehicle\u00a0\nWhile a small percentage of vehicles, medium and heavy-duty vehicles make up a significant part of pollution impacts relative to other highway transportation modes. In particular, the heavy truck segment was responsible for approximately one-quarter of total energy consumption and the carbon dioxide emissions for all highway transportation in 2021, in spite of the fact that it was only responsible for 9% of the vehicle miles traveled. Additionally, the vehicle miles traveled by this segment are projected to increase by more than 30% by 2050.3\nAdvances in fuel economy, utilizing alternative freight modes like rail and waterways, alternative fuels in highly efficient engines (such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas \u2013 a prime example of redirecting energy waste to productive energy use with a wide variety of applications),4 and streamlining logistics will likely be important to keep this segment energy-productive, and reduce local particulate, NOx, and carbon emissions.\n49\nLight-Duty Electric Vehicles\nChart credit: Atlas (2022), EV Hub\nElectric vehicles (EVs) in the light duty segment (which include battery-electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell electric vehicles) present significant efficiency gains over conventional vehicles, with battery-electric cars estimated to be twice as efficient as a conventional car on a well-to-wheel basis.5 The U.S. market for these vehicles has grown quickly in the last decade, driven in part by Zero-Emission Vehicle mandates in select states, and federal and state tax credits. In the first two quarters of\u00a0 2022, the annual U.S. sales of EVs have already exceeded total sales in 2015 by more than a factor of four, to 430,000, primarily due to battery-electric vehicle growth. The U.S. currently has an estimated 1.5 million electric vehicles, and there are 84 different makes and models of plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles on the U.S. market as of September 2022.6, 7\n50\nEV Transit\nSource: Calstart (2021)\nThe adoption of full-size, zero-emissions transit buses grew by 27% between 2020 and 2021 in the U.S. California has the largest number of zero-emissions transit buses (1,371) and has passed regulation that transit buses must be zero-emission by 2030. Nationally, the number of zero-energy buses is expected to increase as a result of new funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\nBattery-electric buses make up the large majority of zero-emissions transit buses in the country today, likely due to their cost, charging infrastructure requirements, and other operational considerations. Fuel cell adoption is also expected to increase as these buses perform better on longer routes and transit agencies are increasingly considering these buses for longer routes.8\n51\nEV Charging Infrastructure\nSource: DOE (2022), Alternative Fuels Data Center\nSource: DOE (2022), Alternative Fuels Data Center\nEVs require wide availability of EV-charging infrastructure to mitigate the market barrier caused by range anxiety.9 The number of charging stations available in the U.S. has grown dramatically in the last 10 years, expanding in number and geographical coverage. As of September 2022, there were 36,213 publicly available charging stations that were Level-2 or Direct Current Fast Charge (DCFC) stations, which are capable of charging most vehicles in 20 to 30 minutes. This is an over 200% increase in chargers relative to 2019, when it was estimated that roughly 10,000 of these charging stations were installed nationwide.10\n52\nVehicle Miles Traveled\nSource: DOT (2019), Travel Monitoring\nSince 1970, Americans have nearly tripled the number of vehicle miles traveled by cars and trucks. Though COVID led to a dramatic decrease in vehicle miles traveled in 2020, the U.S. is already on track to exceed its 2019 levels. More driving leads to traffic congestion, resulting in increased energy waste, air pollution, time waste, and costly infrastructure degradation.\n53\nUtilization Of Transportation Modes\nSource: ORNL (2022), Transportation Energy Data Book 40, Table 2.13\nEfficiency in the transportation sector is related to the efficiency of the vehicles, but also to the load factor, which reflects vehicle occupancy. These factors can be combined to consider the passenger miles per gallon of gasoline (pmpG), which quantifies the efficiency of moving one person one mile at a given vehicle fuel economy and vehicle occupancy. On a pmpG basis, rail options tend to be the most efficient travel modes (80-140 pmpG), but domestic flights, which exhibit the lowest fuel economy (0.45 pmpgG) appear relatively efficient per passenger due to a high load factor (averaging 120 passengers per flight) \u2014 a reflection of airlines\u2019 efforts to ensure planes fly full. In contrast, transit buses currently exhibit lower pmpG (26) than cars (43) due to lower average levels of national bus ridership. However, during high ridership periods, transit bus pmpG is estimated to be over four times higher (137).11 This illustrates the value of increasing not only fuel economy, but the utilization of such modes.\n54\nTransit Equity Metrics\nClean, Efficient Transportation for Low-Income Communities Scores (out of 6 possible points)\nSource: ACEEE (2021) City Scorecard\nCreating a broad low-carbon transportation system is an essential part of reducing transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), localized pollution, creating livable communities, and ensuring that our transportation system serves everyone.12\nAs cities have sprawled and jobs have moved away from urban cores, many low-income communities have become geographically isolated and inadequately served by affordable, efficient transportation. These communities\u2019 transportation options are often limited to automobiles and unreliable public transport services. Expenditures for vehicles, including the cost of fuel, insurance, and maintenance, can be large and unpredictable for these households. Cities can use a number of policy levers to increase access to mobility options other than personal vehicles in low-income communities, such as low-income housing near transit, low-income access to high-quality transit, and subsidized access to efficient transportation options.13\n\u00a0\nFootnotes\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright 2022\n",

PHEVs are also beneficial for company car drivers due to their low official CO2 emissions, resulting in low benefit-in-kind (BIK) ratings.\n\nHere are the top 10 PHEVs with the longest electric-only ranges, using official WLTP electric-only ranges and real-world figures where appropriate:\n\n1. **Range Rover Sport P460e Dynamic SE**\n   - List price: \u00a392,980\n   - Target Price: \u00a390,425\n   - Electric-only range: 75 miles (50 miles real-world)\n\n2. **Mercedes GLC 300e AMG Line**\n   - List price: \u00a363,210\n   - Target Price: \u00a361,210\n   - Electric-only range: 75 miles (57 miles real-world)\n\n3. **Range Rover P460e SE**\n   - List price: \u00a3115,585\n   - Target Price: \u00a3115,585\n   - Electric-only range: 74 miles\n\n4. **Mercedes C-Class C300e AMG Line Premium**\n   - List price: \u00a355,025\n   - Target Price: \u00a353,025\n   - Electric-only range: 66 miles\n\n5. **Mercedes E-Class E300e AMG Line Premium**\n   - List price: \u00a370,900\n   - Target Price: \u00a370,900\n   - Electric-only range: 65 miles\n\n6. **Mercedes C-Class Estate C300e AMG Line Premium Plus**\n   - List price: \u00a360,585\n   - Target Price: \u00a360,585\n   - Electric-only range: 64 miles\n\n7. **Mercedes E-Class Estate E300e AMG Line Premium**\n   - List price: \u00a373,150\n   - Target Price: \u00a373,150\n   - Electric-only range: 63 miles\n\n8. **Mercedes S-Class S580e L AMG Line Premium**\n   - List price: \u00a3113,575\n   - Target Price: \u00a3113,575\n   - Electric-only range: 63 miles\n\n9. **BMW 530e M Sport**\n   - List price: \u00a359,455\n   - Target Price: \u00a356,674\n   - Electric-only range: 63 miles\n\n10. **BMW X5 xDrive50e M Sport**\n    - List price: \u00a380,835\n    - Target Price: \u00a377,038\n    - Electric-only range: 62 miles\n\nThese PHEVs offer a range of benefits, including reduced fuel costs, lower emissions, and the convenience of electric-only driving for short trips. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, but all provide substantial electric-only ranges, making them suitable for various needs and preferences.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards have significantly improved the miles per gallon (mpg) of new passenger cars by over 90% since 1975. Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which account for 9% of total vehicle miles traveled, use about 25% of all highway energy. Their vehicle miles traveled are expected to increase by more than 30% by 2050. Electric vehicle (EV) sales have more than doubled since 2019, with the U.S. now having an estimated 1.5 million EVs on the road. The number of vehicle miles traveled has tripled since 1970, leading to increased traffic congestion, consumer costs, and air pollution. The efficiency of transportation modes depends on both fuel economy and vehicle utilization. Transportation accounts for 27% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and 67% of U.S. oil use. The Biden administration has set new fuel standards requiring carmakers to achieve average fuel efficiencies of 49 mpg. California aims for all vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035. Medium and heavy-duty vehicles, despite being a small percentage of vehicles, contribute significantly to pollution. Advances in fuel economy, alternative fuels, and logistics are crucial for this segment. Light-duty EVs, including battery-electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell electric vehicles, are significantly more efficient than conventional vehicles. The U.S. market for these vehicles has grown rapidly, driven by mandates and tax credits. The adoption of zero-emissions transit buses grew by 27% between 2020 and 2021, with California leading in numbers. Battery-electric buses are the majority, but fuel cell adoption is expected to increase. The number of EV charging stations in the U.S. has grown dramatically, with over 36,213 publicly available charging stations as of September 2022. Since 1970, vehicle miles traveled by cars and trucks have nearly tripled, leading to increased energy waste and pollution. Efficiency in transportation also depends on vehicle occupancy, with rail options being the most efficient. Transit buses have lower efficiency due to lower ridership but can be highly efficient during peak times. Creating a low-carbon transportation system is essential for reducing emissions and ensuring equitable access to transportation, especially for low-income communities.",
