Plus, it\u2019s estimated that roughly 40% of all web traffic is hosted by those two companies combined. But which looks like the better buy today, AMZN stock or GOOG stock?\nBoth stocks were beaten down by the growth stock sell-off of 2022. GOOG has suffered less damage from all the selling, down 6% since the start of 2022 vs. AMZN\u2019s 13% loss. Going back a bit further, to just after the March 2020 Covid crash, the performance of both stocks has been far more palatable, with GOOG up 126% in since March 13, 2020, vs. a 63% gain for AMZN. Over the last five years, GOOG is up 156% vs. an 83% gain in AMZN.\nThose are strong returns for GOOG, especially when compared to the 64% return in the S&P 500 in the last five years. Amazon though? Not so much. Now the question is: Can AMZN and GOOG repeat or beat that performance over the next five years?\n[text_ad]\nIt would be foolish to doubt either company at this point. That said, no stock continues to grow at a breakneck pace forever. Just ask anyone who bought General Electric (GE) 10 or 15 years ago, when it ranked among the 10 largest companies in the world by market cap. So chances are, one or both of these blue-chip tech stocks will start to slow in the years ahead.\nGiven that backdrop, I thought it might be a fun exercise to examine which tech giant stock is better positioned for future growth.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at AMZN stock and GOOG stock, broken into a few key numbers:\nTrailing P/Es: AMZN 76, GOOG 26\nForward P/Es: AMZN 42, GOOG 20\nEstimated 2023 revenue growth: AMZN 11%, GOOG 8.2%\nEstimated 2023 EPS growth: AMZN 1,089%, GOOG 51.4%\nCash per share: AMZN $6.21, GOOG $9.58\nInstitutional ownership: AMZN 61%, GOOG 62%\nThat comparison tells us that AMZN is still the more overvalued stock. However, until recently it had been the faster-growing company on both the top and bottom lines; and it had been since 2016. That was also the year Amazon first turned consistently profitable.\nThat said, Google has way more cash than Amazon - nearly double in terms of total cash, with roughly a fifth as much debt. Considering that Amazon brings in nearly twice as much revenue as Google annually (though that gap is closing), that means that Amazon has been way more willing to spend its cash on things that will grow the company - the Amazon Prime Video streaming service that is rivaling Netflix these days; a new foray into live sports with NFL broadcasts; the Amazon Echo, Amazon Web Services, etc. Google looks more like a cash hoarder. The result is that Amazon stock has grown much faster than GOOG stock in the last decade, though that has certainly changed in the last two years.\nThe guess here is that Google will start loosening its purse strings in the coming years, devoting it to new, exciting products like the long-anticipated and recently released Google Pixel Watch intended to rival the Apple Watch, a new Pixel smartphone, or perhaps Google will join Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Disney in the big-money streaming video wars (YouTube did make a splash buying the NFL broadcast rights). Regardless of what it comes up with, bet on Google spending more of its $120 billion cash stockpile soon. If it does, that could capture investors\u2019 attention the way Amazon did up until the last few years.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either of these growth stocks. If you bought both of them five, 10 or even 15 years ago, you\u2019ve made a LOT of money. But AMZN has been the better performer, at least up until recently. I think that might change in the years to come. Between its cash stockpile, untapped potential revenue streams, and cheaper valuation, I like GOOG stock to outperform AMZN in the next five years. In fact, that shift already seems to be taking place, as the last few years have shown. It could be the start of a longer-term role reversal between two of the biggest, baddest tech stocks on the block.\nFurthermore, after such extreme selling last year, both these stocks are still trading below their 2021 levels despite a furious run-up to start this year. You could buy both (or either, although I prefer GOOG); either way, an investment in GOOG stock will likely turn out quite well five years from now.\nFor a list of the stocks that actually have momentum after a tough earnings season, consider taking a trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Trader.

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

The reorder point (ROP) is a technique in supply chain management to balance these issues by determining the minimum number of units needed in stock to meet sales orders or production targets. When inventory falls below this point, a new purchase order is triggered. Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times.

Authored by USApple Vice President of Insights and Analytics, Chris Gerlach, the report takes an in-depth look at the trends and forces \u2013 from political headwinds to weather events \u2013 that shape the U.S. apple industry.\n*The Outlook Report is based on recently released United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates. After the presentation of those numbers, USApple members met in-person to discuss current growing conditions to formulate a more up-to-date production estimate. The final USApple 2024/25 crop year forecast is an adjustment of the USDA numbers based on those conversations.\nU.S. Production\nAccording to USApple\u2019s analysis, total U.S. apple production for the 2024/25 crop year (CY) will be 259,517,252 bushels. This represents a 10.1% decrease compared to last year\u2019s final production figure.\n\u201cGrowers from across the U.S. are reporting the crop quality is excellent,\u201d said Gerlach.\nThese figures are more comprehensive than USDA data, which only look at the top seven apple-producing states. USApple analyzes the production from states outside of the top seven and adds that back into USDA\u2019s figure. It also incorporates feedback from growers based on what they\u2019re seeing in the field every day.\n\u201cDespite various challenges, the resilience and dedication of our growers have led to another promising year for apple production,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cThe data we\u2019ve gathered not only highlights the strength of our industry, but also underscores the importance of innovation and adaptability in ensuring a bountiful harvest.\u201d\nVarietal Mix\nAt the varietal level, Gala is expected to retain the top spot with more than 48 million bushels produced, accounting for around 17% of the U.S. apple market. After Gala, rounding out the top five are Red Delicious (12.3%), Granny Smith (10%), Honeycrisp (9.8%) and Fuji (9.4%).\nIn general, the varieties on the rise include Honeycrisp, Pink Lady/Cripps Pink and Cosmic Crisp\u00ae. Fuji, Rome and \u201cother\u201d varieties have remained relatively consistent compared to 2019/20 production volumes. Varieties on the decline include Gala and Red Delicious.\n\u201cWe still see strong Honeycrisp production, but it\u2019s tempered this year,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cWith volumes aligning more closely with Gala and Red Delicious, we may see production levels stabilize rather than increase dramatically in the future.\u201d\nTrade\nAccording to USDA trade data, fresh apple exports totaled 46.4 million bushels in the 2023/24 CY (July to June). This is around 14 million bushels higher than 2022/23 export levels \u2013 an astonishing 44% year-over-year increase.\nDuring the same period, fresh apple imports dropped by around one million bushels, a 15% decline. The joint effects of increasing exports and decreasing imports caused the already net positive fresh apple trade balance to grow to more than 42 million bushels.\nThe surge in fresh apple exports is largely attributed to the abundant domestic supply, competitive pricing abroad, and favorable positive trade policies.\n\u201cThanks to the removal of previously imposed tariffs on our apples, exports to India are up nearly 4,000% year over year. We are optimistic that this critical market will continue to grow in volume and value,\u201d said Gerlach.\nGlobal ProductionAccording to United Nations (UN) data, worldwide apple production surpassed 5 billion bushels for the first time in 2022 (the latest available datapoint). In 2022, China alone was responsible for producing 2.5 billion bushels, around half of the world\u2019s total supply. In 2021, Turkey overtook the U.S. to become the world\u2019s second largest apple producer and maintained that spot in 2022, even widening the gap between us (with 253 million bushels, 5% of world production).

    "Summarized_Document": "Chicago (August 16, 2024)\u2014 After record-breaking production last year, apple growers expect another high-performing year, according to a new report released by the U.S. Apple Association (USApple) at the organization\u2019s 129th annual Outlook Conference in Chicago. USApple\u2019s Industry Outlook 2024 provides the most up-to-date data and analysis on U.S. and global apple production, utilization, and trade. Authored by USApple Vice President of Insights and Analytics, Chris Gerlach, the report takes an in-depth look at the trends and forces \u2013 from political headwinds to weather events \u2013 that shape the U.S. apple industry. The Outlook Report is based on recently released United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates. After the presentation of those numbers, USApple members met in-person to discuss current growing conditions to formulate a more up-to-date production estimate. The final USApple 2024/25 crop year forecast is an adjustment of the USDA numbers based on those conversations. According to USApple\u2019s analysis, total U.S. apple production for the 2024/25 crop year (CY) will be 259,517,252 bushels. This represents a 10.1% decrease compared to last year\u2019s final production figure. \u201cGrowers from across the U.S. are reporting the crop quality is excellent,\u201d said Gerlach. These figures are more comprehensive than USDA data, which only look at the top seven apple-producing states. USApple analyzes the production from states outside of the top seven and adds that back into USDA\u2019s figure. It also incorporates feedback from growers based on what they\u2019re seeing in the field every day. \u201cDespite various challenges, the resilience and dedication of our growers have led to another promising year for apple production,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cThe data we\u2019ve gathered not only highlights the strength of our industry, but also underscores the importance of innovation and adaptability in ensuring a bountiful harvest.\u201d At the varietal level, Gala is expected to retain the top spot with more than 48 million bushels produced, accounting for around 17% of the U.S. apple market. After Gala, rounding out the top five are Red Delicious (12.3%), Granny Smith (10%), Honeycrisp (9.8%) and Fuji (9.4%). In general, the varieties on the rise include Honeycrisp, Pink Lady/Cripps Pink and Cosmic Crisp\u00ae. Fuji, Rome and \u201cother\u201d varieties have remained relatively consistent compared to 2019/20 production volumes. Varieties on the decline include Gala and Red Delicious. \u201cWe still see strong Honeycrisp production, but it\u2019s tempered this year,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cWith volumes aligning more closely with Gala and Red Delicious, we may see production levels stabilize rather than increase dramatically in the future.\u201d According to USDA trade data, fresh apple exports totaled 46.4 million bushels in the 2023/24 CY (July to June). This is around 14 million bushels higher than 2022/23 export levels \u2013 an astonishing 44% year-over-year increase. During the same period, fresh apple imports dropped by around one million bushels, a 15% decline. The joint effects of increasing exports and decreasing imports caused the already net positive fresh apple trade balance to grow to more than 42 million bushels. The surge in fresh apple exports is largely attributed to the abundant domestic supply, competitive pricing abroad, and favorable positive trade policies. \u201cThanks to the removal of previously imposed tariffs on our apples, exports to India are up nearly 4,000% year over year. We are optimistic that this critical market will continue to grow in volume and value,\u201d said Gerlach. According to United Nations (UN) data, worldwide apple production surpassed 5 billion bushels for the first time in 2022 (the latest available datapoint). In 2022, China alone was responsible for producing 2.5 billion bushels, around half of the world\u2019s total supply. In 2021, Turkey overtook the U.S. to become the world\u2019s second largest apple producer and maintained that spot in 2022, even widening the gap between us (with 253 million bushels, 5% of world production). The U.S., in the third spot, was credited with 232 million bushels and 4.6% of world production. Rounding out the top five were Poland (4.4%) and India (2.7%).

    "Document": "\nMarch Weather in Paris France\n\n\nDaily high temperatures increase by 7\u00c2\u00b0F, from 49\u00c2\u00b0F to 56\u00c2\u00b0F, rarely falling below 40\u00c2\u00b0F or exceeding 67\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nDaily low temperatures increase by 4\u00c2\u00b0F, from 37\u00c2\u00b0F to 41\u00c2\u00b0F, rarely falling below 28\u00c2\u00b0F or exceeding 49\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nFor reference, on August 3, the hottest day of the year, temperatures in Paris typically range from 59\u00c2\u00b0F to 78\u00c2\u00b0F, while on February 8, the coldest day of the year, they range from 35\u00c2\u00b0F to 45\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nAverage High and Low Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below shows you a compact characterization of the hourly average temperatures for the quarter of the year centered on March. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

We have also added coverage for major international cups such as the UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores.\n    \n\n    FBref is the most complete sources for women's football data on the internet. This includes the entire history of the FIFA Women's World Cup as well as recent domestic league seasons from nine countries, including advanced stats like xG for most of those nine.\n    \n\n    In collaboration with Opta, we are including advanced analytical data such as xG, xA, progressive passing, duels and more for over twenty competitions. For more information on the expected goals model and which competitions have advanced data, see our xG explainer.\n    \n\n        Note that player records are likely not complete for their careers.

    "Document": "Watch CBS News\nGet Ready For Higher Electric Bills, Regulators Sign Off On FPL Rate Increases\n\nOctober 26, 2021 / 11:37 PM EDT\n          / CBS Miami\n        \nTALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/NSF) - State utility regulators Tuesday approved a series of base-rate increases for Florida Power & Light that will result in higher monthly bills for customers in January.\nDespite opponents' arguments that residential and small business customers will end up subsidizing costs for some larger customers, the Public Service Commission unanimously supported a four-year rate settlement, which calls for a $692 million increase in base rates in January and another increase of $560 million in 2023. Additional increases are planned in 2024 and 2025 to pay for solar projects.\nCommission Chairman Gary Clark noted receiving more than 1,100 emails from consumers about the proposal and indicated he had concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and a electric-vehicle charging station program. But, Clark said he understands the need for clean energy investments and pointed to other benefits of the settlement, such as predictability in rates.\n\"There are things within that predictability that I think give homeowners, give businesses some assurity going into the future, that they have a stable rate climate, they can do their budgeting accordingly,\" Clark said. \"I think that is a very positive, very positive thing.\"\nCommissioners also added a requirement for annual reports on the company's expansion of infrastructure for electric vehicles.\nFPL reached the rate settlement in August with the state Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Three other parties later signed on.\nThe rate plan incorporates the merger of FPL and Northwest Florida's Gulf Power. That merger formally took effect Jan. 1, but it came with issues such as the utilities having widely different rates.\nIn a prepared statement, FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy said the deal benefits all customers by keeping \"bills low\" while \"accelerating investments in clean energy.\"\n\"Florida is a rapidly growing state on the front lines of climate change, and our customers deserve bold, decisive, long-term actions as we continue building a more resilient and sustainable energy future all of us can depend on, including future generations,\" Silagy said in the statement.\nFor customers outside of Northwest Florida who use 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month, bills are expected to go from the current $101.70 to $113.85 in January. Those bills would increase to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. In addition to base rates, the totals include costs for such things as natural gas for power plants.\nThe plan uses what is described as a \"transition rider\" to take into account the substantially different rates that FPL and Gulf have charged. The result will leave Northwest Florida customers paying more than FPL customers in other areas.\nUnder the plan, Gulf residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt hours a month will see their bills go from the current $129.24 to $137.49 in January. They then would see the bills decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024 and $126.47 in 2025.\nFPL filed a base-rate proposal in March and then negotiated the settlement, which trimmed the original proposal by about $428 million. The settlement, in part, reduced a targeted return on equity --- a closely watched measure of profitability --- from 11.5 percent to 10.6 percent.\n\"I believe that all of the parties are to be commended for the outstanding job that you did, negotiating on behalf of the folks that you represented,\" Clark said. \"It's pretty obvious some of you did a little better job than others.\"\nBut the settlement was opposed by Floridians Against Increased Rates, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising, which have members who are residential customers of FPL.\nThose groups argued, in part, that the plan will require residential and small business customers to subsidize the rates of large commercial and industrial customers.\n\"To put it succinctly, a settlement that includes so much wasteful spending to double down on fossil fuels, that transfers so much wealth from residential customers to commercial and industrial customers, and that literally leaves residential customers worse off than in FPL's original proposal, cannot be in the public interest,\" attorneys for the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising wrote in an Oct. 11 brief. \"This 'settlement' gives FPL everything they want --- and more.\"\nThe agreement addresses a series of solar-energy issues, which FPL said will support the development of 16 million solar panels at more than 50 sites across Florida. FPL has been operating under a base-rate settlement that took effect in January 2017 and will end in December.\n(\u00a92021 CBS Local Media. All rights reserved.

Additional increases are planned in 2024 and 2025 to pay for solar projects.\nCommission Chairman Gary Clark noted receiving more than 1,100 emails from consumers about the proposal and indicated he had concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and a electric-vehicle charging station program. But, Clark said he understands the need for clean energy investments and pointed to other benefits of the settlement, such as predictability in rates.\n\"There are things within that predictability that I think give homeowners, give businesses some assurity going into the future, that they have a stable rate climate, they can do their budgeting accordingly,\" Clark said. \"I think that is a very positive, very positive thing.\"\nCommissioners also added a requirement for annual reports on the company's expansion of infrastructure for electric vehicles.\nFPL reached the rate settlement in August with the state Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Three other parties later signed on.\nThe rate plan incorporates the merger of FPL and Northwest Florida's Gulf Power. That merger formally took effect Jan. 1, but it came with issues such as the utilities having widely different rates.\nIn a prepared statement, FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy said the deal benefits all customers by keeping \"bills low\" while \"accelerating investments in clean energy.\"\n\"Florida is a rapidly growing state on the front lines of climate change, and our customers deserve bold, decisive, long-term actions as we continue building a more resilient and sustainable energy future all of us can depend on, including future generations,\" Silagy said in the statement.\nFor customers outside of Northwest Florida who use 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month, bills are expected to go from the current $101.70 to $113.85 in January. Those bills would increase to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. In addition to base rates, the totals include costs for such things as natural gas for power plants.\nThe plan uses what is described as a \"transition rider\" to take into account the substantially different rates that FPL and Gulf have charged. The result will leave Northwest Florida customers paying more than FPL customers in other areas.\nUnder the plan, Gulf residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt hours a month will see their bills go from the current $129.24 to $137.49 in January. They then would see the bills decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024 and $126.47 in 2025.\nFPL filed a base-rate proposal in March and then negotiated the settlement, which trimmed the original proposal by about $428 million. The settlement, in part, reduced a targeted return on equity --- a closely watched measure of profitability --- from 11.5 percent to 10.6 percent.\n\"I believe that all of the parties are to be commended for the outstanding job that you did, negotiating on behalf of the folks that you represented,\" Clark said. \"It's pretty obvious some of you did a little better job than others.\"\nBut the settlement was opposed by Floridians Against Increased Rates, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising, which have members who are residential customers of FPL.\nThose groups argued, in part, that the plan will require residential and small business customers to subsidize the rates of large commercial and industrial customers.\n\"To put it succinctly, a settlement that includes so much wasteful spending to double down on fossil fuels, that transfers so much wealth from residential customers to commercial and industrial customers, and that literally leaves residential customers worse off than in FPL's original proposal, cannot be in the public interest,\" attorneys for the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising wrote in an Oct. 11 brief. \"This 'settlement' gives FPL everything they want --- and more.\"\nThe agreement addresses a series of solar-energy issues, which FPL said will support the development of 16 million solar panels at more than 50 sites across Florida. FPL has been operating under a base-rate settlement that took effect in January 2017 and will end in December.\n(\u00a92021 CBS Local Media. All rights reserved.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work.

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive.

    "Summarized_Document": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",
