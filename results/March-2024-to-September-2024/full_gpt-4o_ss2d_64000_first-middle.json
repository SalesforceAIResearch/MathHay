Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company\u2019s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia\u2019s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%.\nNvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion.\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That\u2019s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year.\nGaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion.\nAnalysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%.\nInvestors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter.\nEven if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results.\nThat could have been a sign that some investors weren\u2019t impressed with Nvidia\u2019s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time.\nInvestors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company\u2019s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips.\n (NVDA)\nAt the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What\u2019s more, he said the company\u2019s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter.\nNvidia, however, is also facing an uncertain future, with president-elect Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. He\u2019s also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.\nThe vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers.

    "question": "What was Nvidia's stock price at the beginning of 2024, given that it closed at $109.61 on May 31, 2024, and the year-to-date increase was 189%?",
    "expected_answer": 37.92733564013841,
    "pred_answer": 37.94,
    "correct": false,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Extracted numerical values from the document\n    closing_price_may_31 = 109.61  # Closing price on May 31, 2024\n    percentage_increase_ytd = 189  # Year-to-date percentage increase\n    \n    # Calculate the stock price at the beginning of 2024\n    initial_price = closing_price_may_31 / 2.89\n    \n    answer = initial_price\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "The closing price of Nvidia on May 31, 2024, was $109.61. The year-to-date increase was 189%. To find the stock price at the beginning of 2024, we need to determine the original price before the increase. Let the initial price be X. The increase of 189% means the stock price increased by 1.89 times the initial price. Therefore, the final price is X + 1.89X = 2.89X. We know that 2.89X = $109.61. Solving for X gives X = $109.61 / 2.89, which equals approximately $37.94.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps to determine the initial stock price at the beginning of 2024. They both start with the closing price on May 31, 2024, which is $109.61, and use the year-to-date percentage increase of 189% to calculate the initial price. The solutions correctly interpret the 189% increase as the stock price being 2.89 times the initial price, leading to the equation 2.89X = $109.61. Both solutions solve for X by dividing $109.61 by 2.89, resulting in approximately $37.94. The slight difference in the final numerical answers (37.92733564013841 vs. 37.94) is due to rounding, but they are effectively the same for practical purposes."

Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

    "question": "What is the combined value of Nvidia's Q3 2024 expected revenue and its year-over-year growth in billions, as of Q3 2024, and Tesla's volatility percentage as of October 29, 2024?",
    "expected_answer": 97.47,
    "pred_answer": 104.713,
    "correct": false,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Nvidia's expected Q3 2024 revenue in billions\n    nvidia_revenue = 33.2\n    # Nvidia's year-over-year growth in billions\n    nvidia_growth = 11.1\n    # Tesla's volatility percentage as of October 29, 2024\n    tesla_volatility = 53.17\n    \n    # Calculate the combined value\n    answer = nvidia_revenue + nvidia_growth + tesla_volatility\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "No",
    "pred_reasoning": "Nvidia's Q3 2024 expected revenue is $33.2 billion, and its year-over-year growth is 83%. To find the growth in billions, we calculate 83% of the previous year's Q3 revenue, which was $22.1 billion. The growth is 0.83 * 22.1 = $18.343 billion. Tesla's volatility as of October 29, 2024, is 53.17%. The combined value of Nvidia's expected revenue and its growth in billions is 33.2 + 18.343 = $51.543 billion. Tesla's volatility percentage is 53.17%. Therefore, the combined value of Nvidia's Q3 2024 expected revenue and its year-over-year growth in billions, and Tesla's volatility percentage is 51.543 + 53.17 = 104.713.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions are different in both reasoning and final answer. Solution 1 calculates the combined value by simply adding Nvidia's expected revenue, its growth in billions, and Tesla's volatility percentage directly, resulting in 97.47. Solution 2, however, calculates Nvidia's growth based on an 83% increase from the previous year's revenue, leading to a different growth value of 18.343 billion. This results in a different combined value of 104.713 when added to Tesla's volatility. The discrepancy arises from the different methods of calculating Nvidia's growth, leading to different final answers."

Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap.

It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock\u2019s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I\u2019ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm\u2019s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla\u2019s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla\u2019s \u201cdifficult environment,\u201d the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it\u2019s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla\u2019s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla\u2019s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA\u2019s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla\u2019s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla\u2019s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company\u2019s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%.\nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla\u2019s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles.\nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that\u2019s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "On August 5, 2024, Tesla's stock price dropped by 12.4% due to the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike. However, over the next five days, the stock price recovered by 8.04%. We need to calculate the percentage increase in volatility based on this stock price recovery. Tesla's volatility on October 29, 2024, was initially 53.17%. To find the new volatility, we apply the same percentage increase of 8.04% to the initial volatility. The calculation is as follows: New Volatility = Initial Volatility * (1 + Percentage Increase) = 53.17 * (1 + 0.0804) = 53.17 * 1.0804 = 57.45%. Therefore, the new volatility percentage is 57.45%.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions aim to calculate the new volatility of Tesla's stock based on an 8.04% increase from an initial volatility of 53.17%. Solution 1 directly applies this percentage increase to the initial volatility, resulting in a calculated new volatility of 57.44486800000001. Solution 2 describes a scenario where Tesla's stock price initially dropped and then recovered by 8.04%, and applies this recovery percentage to the initial volatility to find the new volatility, resulting in 57.45%. The reasoning in both solutions is similar in that they both apply an 8.04% increase to the initial volatility. However, the final numerical answers differ slightly due to rounding: Solution 1 provides a more precise result (57.44486800000001), while Solution 2 rounds it to 57.45. Despite this minor difference in precision, the reasoning and approach are equivalent."

Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

    "pred_reasoning": "From the Long-Context Documents, Google's closing stock price in May 2025 is $194. Meta's total revenue for Q3 2024 is $40,589 million. To find the difference, we subtract Google's closing stock price from Meta's total revenue: 40,589 - 194 = 40,395.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they identify Google's closing stock price in May 2025 as $194 and Meta's total revenue for Q3 2024 as $40,589 million. They both calculate the difference by subtracting Google's stock price from Meta's revenue, resulting in the same numerical answer of 40,395. Although Solution 2 presents the answer as a float (40,395.0), it is numerically equivalent to the integer result in Solution 1 (40,395). Therefore, the solutions are equivalent in reasoning and final answer."

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions involve the same reasoning steps: they identify Google's closing stock price in July 2025 as $232 and Meta's net income for Q3 2024 as $15,688 million. They then add these two values to arrive at the sum. The final numerical answers are also equivalent, with Solution 1 providing an integer (15920) and Solution 2 providing a float (15920.0), which are numerically identical. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent."

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

    "pred_reasoning": "Meta Platforms, Inc.'s total revenue for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024, is $40,589 million. Netflix, Inc.'s stock price on October 1, 2024, is $706.13. To find the difference, subtract Netflix's stock price from Meta's total revenue: 40,589 - 706.13 = 39,882.87.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they calculate the difference between Meta Platforms, Inc.'s revenue for the third quarter and Netflix, Inc.'s stock price on October 1, 2024. Both solutions correctly perform the subtraction: 40,589 - 706.13, resulting in the same final numerical answer of 39,882.87. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent in terms of reasoning and final answer."

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

    "question": "If Meta Platforms, Inc.'s net income for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024, was divided by Netflix, Inc.'s stock price on September 25, 2024, what would be the result?",
    "expected_answer": 21.741781695215924,
    "pred_answer": 21742964.63,
    "correct": false,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Meta Platforms, Inc. net income for the third quarter\n    meta_net_income = 15688\n    \n    # Netflix, Inc. stock price on September 25, 2024\n    netflix_stock_price = 721.56\n    \n    # Calculate the division result\n    answer = meta_net_income / netflix_stock_price\n    return answer",

    "pred_reasoning": "To solve the question, we need to divide Meta Platforms, Inc.'s net income for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024, by Netflix, Inc.'s stock price on September 25, 2024. From the Long-Context Documents, Meta's net income for the third quarter of 2024 is $15,688 million. Netflix's stock price on September 25, 2024, is $721.56. Therefore, the calculation is 15,688,000,000 (converting millions to a whole number) divided by 721.56, which equals approximately 21,742,964.63.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions are different. Solution 1 divides Meta's net income of 15,688 by Netflix's stock price of 721.56, resulting in 21.741781695215924. Solution 2, however, interprets Meta's net income as 15,688 million (or 15,688,000,000) and divides this by the same stock price, resulting in 21,742,964.63. The discrepancy arises from the interpretation of the net income value: Solution 1 uses the number directly, while Solution 2 converts it from millions to a whole number, leading to vastly different results."

Amid these headwinds, Defence Engage looks at the trends which could come to characterise 2024, from battling skills shortages to pivotal digitalisation efforts.\nMarked by ongoing conflicts in Israel-Palestine and Ukraine, 2024 will see ongoing tensions with China and Iran which pose significant threats to the international order. Geopolitical concerns aside, the industry grapples with supply chain issues, talent shortages, operational risks, and rising costs amid inflation. In the biggest global election year in history we could see significant strategic changes from key players such as the USA, UK, India, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. Here are the five key trends likely to dominate 2024\u2026\n\u00a0\n#1 AI and digitalisation efforts to bring security and efficiencies\nThe defence industry faces challenges in rapidly adopting new defensive systems and procedures to keep up with adversaries' technological innovations. From upgrading aging software to mitigate cyber threats, to expanding access to, and the adoption of, key cyber credentials, keeping up with digital trends remains pivotal. Meanwhile, governments are prioritising bringing AI to maturity while ensuring its development is safe and responsible. The rapid adoption of AI, spurred by recent advancements like Chat-GPT, is underway in industry, and indeed OpenAI has already started the year by easing its stance on the use of ChatGPT for military purposes.\nThe impact of AI for defence is forecast to be significant, from helping front-line users detect threats to activating cyber defences faster and with greater agility. Additionally, the integration of AI into defence supply chains could improve platform and parts delivery efficiency, reducing delays and costs, whilst improving security. Meanwhile, digital twins, coupled with machine learning, can enhance visibility of supply chain problems or complexities. According to a BAE report, 86% of defence and aerospace decision makers say their nation has adopted AI for defence applications, so the technology is set to become increasingly mature in 2024.\n\u00a0\n#2 Decarbonisation initiatives continue\nFollowing recent data which indicates that 2023 was the hottest year ever, the impetus behind decarbonisation efforts sees renewed urgency. The contribution of the global defence industry to carbon emissions has come under a microscope, with some having suggested that the sector had been overlooked, but there have been some major decarbonisation initiatives, including the establishment of NATO\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and the UK\u2019s Sustainable Support Strategy.\nThe impact of climate change upon defence goes beyond the weight of its own contributions, with both the UN and NATO describing climate change as a \u2018threat multiplier\u2019, alluding to the destabilising impact climate can have on societies and economies. Industry is rising to meet the challenge, with innovations such as new power solutions or increased circularity in manufacturing. \u00a0Last year the EU signalled its intention for defence supply chains to become more sustainable, alongside developing more localised energy in a drive for logistical resilience. Individual initiatives such as the Royal Air Force\u2019s first use of sustainable aviation fuel in a fighter aircraft are lighting the way towards a greener, more sustainable, military.\n\u00a0\n#3 Recruitment challenges to persist\nDefence is facing significant challenges when it comes to acquiring talent, skills and retention, from front-line military roles to cyber, quantum and manufacturing. In recent weeks the UK\u2019s Royal Navy has seen significant problems with hiring, at a critical time for the force, with ships being deployed to the Red Sea to counter Houthi Rebels. Last month, the Times reported that Armed forces and defence companies are locked in \u2018a war for talent\u2019.\nDwindling forces are due to the lack of recruits for basic training, a lack of digital skills, and the pull of incentives given by neighbouring sectors. The EU and US have recently signalled their plans to try and combat personnel shortages in key areas. The US\u2019 new Defence Industrial Strategy, cites \u2018workforce readiness\u2019 as a key strategic focus, with a desire to develop a \u2018sufficiently skilled and staffed workforce\u2019. Meanwhile, the European Commission expects skills shortages to increase into the future, with defence urgently requiring skills and talent acquisition, as procurement organisations seek to develop and manage emerging disruptive technologies.\n\u00a0\n#4 Agile supply chains to be prioritised\nThe scramble to arm Ukraine and Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China have highlighted US and allied supply chain vulnerabilities. The last couple of years have seen efforts to build a more resilient supply chain. The US CHIPS act and the EU CHIPS Act designed to securitise semiconductor supply, the European Defence Agency has set out to ensure \u2018security of supply\u2019 across the EU, and at the start of 2024, the US\u2019 Defence Industrial Strategy took aim at supply chain fragility, seeking to make it more sustainable alongside more flexible acquisition processes.\n2024 will see more emphasis on agile supply chains: increasing pressure to move away from lengthy procurement processes that cannot react quickly enough or where the end product could be outdated by the time it comes into service. There will be a race to secure and effect easy access to increasingly scarce resources such as minerals driven by the appetite for batteries and the move away from fossil fuels. The surge of additive manufacturing creates a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply option, while new military tactics such as the use of drones and increasing need for cyber security will continue to push military to commercial and more readily available solutions.\n\u00a0\n#5 Alliances and collaboration lead development and procurement\nCollaborative development programmes such as the sixth-generation fighter efforts: Tempest (by Italy, Japan and the UK) and FCAS (by France, Germany and Spain), are key initiatives designed to combine the best of each nation\u2019s domestic capabilities and combat declining resources. Meanwhile, the AUKUS programme demonstrates how two established nuclear navies (UK and US) are aiding Australia in bolstering Indo-Pacific security. Furthermore, NATO\u2019s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which opened its doors with three innovation challenges in 2023, has established test centres and accelerator units across Europe and North America. The collaboration of NATO members is nothing new, but this more centralised effort to progress on emerging disruptive technologies is hoped to go from strength to strength in 2024.\nGroup-purchases have become increasingly common amongst NATO allies in recent years, with a marked increase since the war in Ukraine began. Just two weeks ago, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain agreed to jointly purchase $5.5 billion worth of Patriot missiles following their effective use observed in Ukraine. Additionally, the research opportunities posed by the war in Ukraine have seen allies and industry testing experimental tech in partnership with Ukrainian soldiers, helping speed up development initiatives, particularly for drones. Following on from the big trend of multi-domain integration, Defence Engage expects multi-national development, purchases and bids to strengthen regional military power and aid embattled allies such as Israel and Ukraine, to continue in 2024 amid ongoing geopolitical upheaval.\n\u00a0\nKeep ahead of the trends\nDefence Engage connects suppliers and buyers to help make defence accessible, follow us on LinkedIn or register for our weekly Defence Contracts Digest to stay apprised of new solutions and collaboration opportunities this year.\nWant to discover more about how Defence Engage can enhance your lead-gen efforts and boost your discoverability in Defence?

    "pred_reasoning": "The stock price of Raytheon Technologies Corp on September 25, 2024, is 108.32 EUR. The joint purchase amount of Patriot missiles by Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, and Spain in 2024 is $5.5 billion. To find the total cost, we need to add these two values. Since the stock price is in EUR and the missile purchase amount is in USD, we assume the stock price is directly added to the purchase amount without currency conversion for simplicity. Therefore, the total cost is 108.32 + 5500000000 = 5500000108.32.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions involve adding the joint purchase amount of Patriot missiles, which is $5.5 billion, to the stock price of Raytheon Technologies Corp, which is 108.32. Both solutions assume the stock price is directly added to the purchase amount without currency conversion. The arithmetic operation performed in both solutions is the same, and both arrive at the same final numerical answer of 5500000108.32. Therefore, the reasoning steps and the final answers are identical."

    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "To find the combined net income of Apple and Microsoft for the quarter ending in June 2024, we need to extract the net income figures for both companies from the provided documents. Apple's net income for the quarter ending June 29, 2024, is $21,448 million. Microsoft's net income for the quarter ending June 30, 2024, is $22,036 million. Adding these two figures gives us the combined net income: $21,448 million + $22,036 million = $43,484 million.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they identify the net income figures for Apple and Microsoft for the quarter ending in June 2024, and then they add these figures to find the combined net income. The final numerical answers are also identical, with Solution 1 providing an integer and Solution 2 providing a float, but both representing the same value of 43484. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent."

    "pred_reasoning": "To find the total revenue generated by Apple in the Americas and Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment in the second quarter of 2024, we first extract the relevant numerical data from the documents. From Apple's financial data, the revenue in the Americas for the second quarter of 2024 is $37,678 million. From Microsoft's financial data, the revenue for the Intelligent Cloud segment in the second quarter of 2024 is $28,515 million. Adding these two figures together gives us the total revenue: $37,678 million + $28,515 million = $66,193 million.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they identify the revenue figures for Apple in the Americas and Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment for the second quarter of 2024, and then they add these figures together to calculate the total revenue. The final numerical answers are also effectively identical, with Solution 1 providing an integer and Solution 2 providing a float representation of the same number. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent."

    "pred_reasoning": "To find the increase in Microsoft Cloud revenue from the quarter ending March 31, 2024, to the quarter ending June 30, 2024, we first extract the relevant revenue figures from the document. The Microsoft Cloud revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, was $35.1 billion. For the quarter ending June 30, 2024, the Microsoft Cloud revenue was $36.8 billion. The increase in revenue is calculated by subtracting the revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, from the revenue for the quarter ending June 30, 2024: $36.8 billion - $35.1 billion = $1.7 billion.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they extract the revenue figures for two consecutive quarters and calculate the increase by subtracting the earlier quarter's revenue from the later quarter's revenue. The final numerical answers are also equivalent, with Solution 1 providing the answer as 1700 and Solution 2 providing it as 1.7 billion, which are the same value expressed in different units (1.7 billion is equivalent to 1700 million). Therefore, the solutions are equivalent."

    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions involve calculating the total shareholder return over two quarters, Q3 and Q4 of FY24, where the return for each quarter is $8.4 billion. Solution 1 uses numerical values directly in the code, while Solution 2 describes the process in words. Both solutions perform the same arithmetic operation: adding $8.4 billion for Q3 and $8.4 billion for Q4, resulting in a total of $16.8 billion. The final numerical answers are equivalent, with Solution 1 providing the answer as 16800 (implicitly in millions) and Solution 2 as 16.8 (in billions). Therefore, the solutions are equivalent in reasoning and final answer."

While there is no way to definitively answer that question \u2013 by definition, our fiscal problems are due to the disconnect between spending and revenue \u2013 one way to evaluate our situation would be to put spending and revenue in a historical context as a share of economic output. From that perspective, it is clear the answer is \"both.\"\nIncorporating the effects of the recent budget deal, federal spending is expected to total 21.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, while revenue is expected to total about 16.6 percent of GDP. With 50-year historical averages for spending and revenue at 20.3 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, that means spending will be higher and revenue will be lower than their historical\u00a0averages by about the same amount:\u00a00.8 percent of GDP.\nThis wasn't always so. As recently as 2017, revenue was close to its historical average, and as recently as 2018, spending was as well. But thanks in large part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, both have departed from these averages.\nDue to the rising costs of health, retirement, and interest spending, spending is projected to diverge from its average even further. We estimate that over the next decade, spending will rise to 23.1\u00a0percent of GDP by 2029, which is 2.8 percentage points\u00a0above the historical average. Revenue will rise above its historical average but largely because the net revenue-losing portions of the TCJA are scheduled to expire, mostly after 2025. If those and other tax cuts were continued as the Congressional Budget Office presents in its Alternative Fiscal Scenario (AFS), revenue would remain below its historical average at least through the next decade, with revenue 0.4 percentage points below that average in 2029.\u00a0\nThe fact that spending and revenue are above and below their historical averages, respectively, is troubling, especially since even at these\u00a0averages debt has risen by about 50 percent of GDP over the past half century to its highest level since just after World War II.\nIn the past when the economy was strong and unemployment was low, revenue usually rose above average levels as a share of GDP while spending fell below. This time, policymakers have continued to cut taxes and increase spending regardless of the fiscal consequences.\nTrending\n$700 Billion of Easy Deficit Reduction\nWith the national debt approaching record levels and interest costs exploding, lawmakers will need to consider substantial spending cuts and revenue increases to put the national debt on a more...\nAs the Fed Cuts Rates, Treasury Yields Are Rising\nWith last week\u2019s rate decision, the Federal Reserve has now cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points over the past eight weeks.

    "pred_reasoning": "The mean sea level trend at Miami Beach from 1931 to 1981 is given as 2.39 mm/year. The federal budget deficit in the United States as of October 2024 is reported to be $2.0 trillion. To find the difference between these two values, we need to convert the budget deficit from trillions to a comparable unit with the sea level trend. Since the sea level trend is in mm/year, we will keep the budget deficit in trillions as it is a large-scale financial figure. The difference is calculated as 2.39 mm/year - 2.0 trillion, which is not a direct arithmetic operation due to the different units. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we consider the numerical difference without unit conversion, resulting in 2.39 - 2.0 = 0.39.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions are not equivalent. Solution 1 directly performs a subtraction between two numerical values without considering the units, resulting in a numerical answer of 0.3900000000000001. Solution 2 acknowledges the difference in units between the sea level trend and the budget deficit but still performs the subtraction for the sake of the exercise, resulting in a numerical answer of 0.39. Although the numerical difference is minor due to floating-point precision, the reasoning in Solution 2 highlights the unit discrepancy, which is not addressed in Solution 1."

They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100.

The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities. The changes in high tide flooding over time are greatest where elevation is lower, local RSL rise is higher, or extreme variability is less.\nIn a sense, today\u2019s flood will become tomorrow\u2019s high tide, as sea level rise will cause flooding to occur more frequently and last for longer durations of time.\nThe red layer in the map represents areas currently subject to tidal flooding, often called \u201crecurrent or nuisance flooding.\u201d\nClick on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings,  and advisories.\nCurrent Location\nHigh Tide Flooding\nHistorical Yearly Inundation Events\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\nUse the sea level rise snapshot to communicate potential impacts at the county level\nLake Level Viewer\nVisualize potential lake level changes and impacts for the U.S. Great Lakes\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\nMap people, places, and natural resources that are potentially exposed to coastal flooding\nTakeaways from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report\nWatch this video to explore four takeaways from the report and key actions that communities can take\nGet more sea level rise and inundation resources and tools from the Digital Coast.\nAbout Sea Level Rise Viewer v 3.0.0\nThe purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.\nThe data and maps in this tool illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction. Water levels are shown as they would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind-driven tides). The data, maps, and information provided should be used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The data and maps in this tool are provided \u201cas is\u201d without warranty to their performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated with the results and performance of these data is assumed by the user. This tool should be used strictly as a planning reference tool and not for navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.\nAdditional Resources\nLeveed Areas Disclaimer\nLevees are displayed as yellow lines, and enclosed leveed areas are displayed as a white stippled pattern.\nMajor federal leveed areas were assumed high enough and strong enough to protect against inundation depicted in this viewer, and therefore no inundation was mapped in these regions.\nMinor (nonfederal) leveed areas were mapped using the best available elevation data that capture leveed features. In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\nReducing the Effects of Urban Flooding in New York City Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 3 June 2023 Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding in New York City PRE-DECISIONAL DRAFT \u2013 Not for Public Distribution or Release (FEMA Footer) Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this publication do not necessarily reflect the views of FEMA.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

    "pred_reasoning": "From the Long-Context Documents, the number of historical yearly inundation events in July 2020 is given as data through 2019, which is not explicitly stated but can be assumed to be a certain number. However, the peak hourly rainfall intensity during Hurricane Ida in September 2021 in Central Park, New York City, is explicitly mentioned as 3.15 inches per hour. Since the number of inundation events is not explicitly provided, we cannot calculate the difference. Therefore, the answer is based on the available data for the peak hourly rainfall intensity.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Solution 1 and Solution 2 are different in both reasoning and final answer. Solution 1 assumes a specific number of historical inundation events (10) and performs a subtraction with the peak rainfall intensity (3.15), resulting in an answer of 6.85. Solution 2, on the other hand, states that the number of inundation events is not explicitly provided and therefore does not perform the subtraction, instead providing the peak rainfall intensity (3.15) as the answer. The reasoning steps and the final numerical answers are not the same."

They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter)\r\n                            scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century.

These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities. The changes in high tide flooding over time are greatest where elevation is lower, local RSL rise is higher, or extreme variability is less.\nIn a sense, today\u2019s flood will become tomorrow\u2019s high tide, as sea level rise will cause flooding to occur more frequently and last for longer durations of time.\nThe red layer in the map represents areas currently subject to tidal flooding, often called \u201crecurrent or nuisance flooding.\u201d\nClick on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings,  and advisories.\nCurrent Location\nHigh Tide Flooding\nHistorical Yearly Inundation Events\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\nUse the sea level rise snapshot to communicate potential impacts at the county level\nLake Level Viewer\nVisualize potential lake level changes and impacts for the U.S. Great Lakes\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\nMap people, places, and natural resources that are potentially exposed to coastal flooding\nTakeaways from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report\nWatch this video to explore four takeaways from the report and key actions that communities can take\nGet more sea level rise and inundation resources and tools from the Digital Coast.\nAbout Sea Level Rise Viewer v 3.0.0\nThe purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.\nThe data and maps in this tool illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction. Water levels are shown as they would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind-driven tides). The data, maps, and information provided should be used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The data and maps in this tool are provided \u201cas is\u201d without warranty to their performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated with the results and performance of these data is assumed by the user. This tool should be used strictly as a planning reference tool and not for navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.\nAdditional Resources\nLeveed Areas Disclaimer\nLevees are displayed as yellow lines, and enclosed leveed areas are displayed as a white stippled pattern.\nMajor federal leveed areas were assumed high enough and strong enough to protect against inundation depicted in this viewer, and therefore no inundation was mapped in these regions.\nMinor (nonfederal) leveed areas were mapped using the best available elevation data that capture leveed features. In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\nReducing the Effects of Urban Flooding in New York City Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 3 June 2023 Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding in New York City PRE-DECISIONAL DRAFT \u2013 Not for Public Distribution or Release (FEMA Footer) Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this publication do not necessarily reflect the views of FEMA.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows. Source: CoCoRaHS Mapping Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 4 2.\nRainfall Runoff and Urban Flooding Basics Cities and highly urbanized areas have many buildings and paved surfaces, including streets, parking lots, and sidewalks. When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

Agencies and organizations are working to prepare people as their world changes around them, and NASA information is helping these efforts.\nThe agency\u2019s global data is now available in the sea level section of the Earth Information Center. NASA developed the global sea level change website in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, the World Bank, the U.S. Department of State, and the United Nations Development Programme. \u00a0\nThe site includes information on projected sea level rise through the year 2150 for coastlines around the world, as well as estimates of how much flooding a coastal community or region can expect to see in the next 30 years. The projections come from data collected by NASA and its partners and from computer models of ice sheets and the ocean, as well as the latest sea level assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other sources.\n\u201cNASA innovates for the benefit of humanity. Our cutting-edge instruments and data-driven information tools help communities and organizations respond to natural hazards and extreme weather, and inform critical coastal infrastructure planning decisions,\u201d said Karen St. Germain, director of the Earth science division at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nInformation to Action\nInternational organizations such as the World Bank will use the data from the global sea level change site for tasks including the creation of Climate Risk Profiles for countries especially vulnerable to sea level rise.\nThe Defense Department will continue to incorporate sea level rise data into its plans to anticipate and respond to hazards posed to its facilities by the effects of rising oceans. Similarly, the State Department uses the information for activities ranging from disaster preparedness to long-term adaptation planning to supporting partners around the world in related efforts.\n\u201cWe are at a moment of truth in our fight against the climate crisis. The science is unequivocal and must serve as the bedrock upon which decision-making is built. With many communities around the world already facing severe impacts from sea-level rise, this new resource provides a vital tool to help them protect lives and livelihoods. It also illustrates what is at stake between a 1.5-degree-Celsius world and a current-policies trajectory for all coastal communities worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Secretary-General Selwin Hart, special adviser to the United Nations secretary-general on climate action and just transition.\nRising Faster\nNASA-led data analyses have revealed that between 1970 and 2023, 96% of countries with coastlines have experienced sea level rise. The rate of that global rise has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) per year in 1993 to about 0.18 inches (0.45 centimeters) per year in 2023.\nAs the rate of sea level rise increases, millions of people could face the related effects sooner than previously projected, including larger storm surges, more saltwater intrusion into groundwater, and additional high-tide flood days \u2014 also known as nuisance floods or sunny day floods.\n\u201cThis new platform shows the timing of future floods and the magnitude of rising waters in all coastal countries worldwide, connecting science and physics to impacts on people\u2019s livelihoods and safety,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director of the ocean physics program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nData released earlier this year found that Pacific Island nations will experience at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) of sea level rise in the next 30 years. The number of high-tide flood days will increase by an order of magnitude for nearly all Pacific Island nations by the 2050s.\n\u201cThe data is clear: Sea levels are rising around the world, and they\u2019re rising faster and faster,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and head of the agency\u2019s sea level change science team. \u201cHaving the best information to make decisions about how to plan for rising seas is more crucial than ever.\u201d\nTo explore the global sea level change site:\nhttps://earth.gov/sealevel\nNews Media Contacts\nKaren Fox / Elizabeth VlockNASA Headquarters, Washington202-358-1600karen.c.fox@nasa.gov / elizabeth.a.vlock@nasa.gov\nJane J.

    "relevant_documents": "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R.

St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available.

These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F.

St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",

The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7",

The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\u00a0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals\u2014expanding some and shrinking others.\u00a0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget\u2014how much sunlight\u00a0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat\u2014over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\u00a0temperature readings\u00a0to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\u00a0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\u00a0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The \"coolest\" month was November, which was 1.35 \u02daF (0.75 \u02daC) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)\u2013the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86\u00b0C (1.55\u00b0F) above the 20th century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F). This value is 0.13\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02\u00b0C (0.04\u00b0F) higher than the last year's (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014\u20132022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's\u00a02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\u00a0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\u00a00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\u00a0Celsius)\u00a0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 \u00b0F (0.18 \u00b0C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities\u2014burning fossil fuels and clearing forests\u2014add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (\"representative concentration pathways,\" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns. (right)\u00a0 Projected temperature increase relative to the 1901-1960 average depending on which RCP we eventually follow. Image by Katharine Hayhoe, from the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nAccording to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,\u00a0 models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.\nReferences\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2023).

While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting.

St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7Main Menu\nBreadcrumb\nClimate Change: Global Temperature\nYearly surface temperature compared to the 20th-century average from 1880\u20132022. Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\u00a0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals\u2014expanding some and shrinking others.\u00a0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget\u2014how much sunlight\u00a0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat\u2014over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\u00a0temperature readings\u00a0to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\u00a0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\u00a0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The \"coolest\" month was November, which was 1.35 \u02daF (0.75 \u02daC) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)\u2013the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86\u00b0C (1.55\u00b0F) above the 20th century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F). This value is 0.13\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02\u00b0C (0.04\u00b0F) higher than the last year's (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014\u20132022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's\u00a02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\u00a0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\u00a00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\u00a0Celsius)\u00a0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 \u00b0F (0.18 \u00b0C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities\u2014burning fossil fuels and clearing forests\u2014add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (\"representative concentration pathways,\" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns. (right)\u00a0 Projected temperature increase relative to the 1901-1960 average depending on which RCP we eventually follow. Image by Katharine Hayhoe, from the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nAccording to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,\u00a0 models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.\nReferences\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2023).

The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer.\nSummer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August.\nAs we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here\u2019s the outlook from NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September.\nThe U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September.\u00a0Much warmer\u00a0or\u00a0much cooler than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nOn August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above average temperatures across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above average precipitation along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest.\nThe precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September.\u00a0Much higher\u00a0or\u00a0much lower than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nIn addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I\u2019ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here\u2019s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the most likely outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found here.\nThe updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC\u2019s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With the expected arrival of La Ni\u00f1a somewhat delayed, it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry) can influence temperatures and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks.\nTemperature outlook favors more heat in the West, uncertainty in much of the East\nThe September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. (Well above average means \u201cin the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.\u201d) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with equal chance odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions.\nThe best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is \u201cequal chances\u201d along the coast.\nIt\u2019s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so \u201cequal chances\u201d is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month.\nPrecipitation outlook tilts wet in across the South, mainly dry across the North\nThe precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-\u201cequal chances\u201d forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough.\nBelow-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods.\nU. S. Drought area increases further during August\nThe amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing extreme and exceptional drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards.\nThe summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our\u00a0Data Snapshots Collection,\u00a0based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project.\u00a0\nRegionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north.\nDrought outlook mainly predicts persistence and development, but improvement across parts of the South\nU.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See\u00a0CPC version\u00a0for Alaska and Hawaii.\nWith above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.\nTo read the entire discussion of the monthly climate outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center, check out their\u00a0website.\nWe value your feedback\nHelp us improve our content\nRelated Content\nNEWS & FEATURES\nMAPS & DATA\nTEACHING CLIMATE\nCLIMATE RESILIENCE TOOLKIT\nStay Connected\nSecretary Naig: \u201cIowa Remained a Production Powerhouse\u201d\nDES MOINES, Iowa (Jan. 12, 2024) \u2013 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig commented today on the 2023 Iowa Crop Production Annual Summary released by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. The national summary and state summaries are released in January each year. \u00a0\n\u201cEven with all the weather challenges last year, Iowa remained a production powerhouse and that\u2019s a testament to the assistance of timely rains, the resiliency of Iowa farmers, and continuous improvements in genetics, traits, equipment, technology, production methods and many other innovations,\u201d said Secretary Naig.\u00a0\nDespite 2023 ending as the state\u2019s 22nd driest year on record, with 8 of the 12 months registering below normal precipitation and persistent drought continuing for a record 184 consecutive weeks and counting, Iowans once again produced a historically strong corn and soybean crop.2023 Iowa crop production highlights include:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 201 bushels per acre and 2.52 billion bushels of production, this year\u2019s Iowa corn crop ranks as the 4th highest yield and 5th largest production in state history and helped drive the national corn yield and production to all-time record levels.\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 58 bushels per acre and 573 million bushels of production, this year\u2019s soybean crop ranked as the 4th highest yield and 3rd highest production in Iowa history, contributing to the country\u2019s 4th highest yield and 7th largest soybean crop ever.Strong production requires continual efforts to build markets and promote conservation, both of which are top priorities for Secretary Naig and the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\u201cAs Iowa remains a pacesetter in innovation and crop production,\u00a0I'll continue to focus on protecting our essential natural resources like soil and water, and creating new markets and expanding existing markets locally, domestically and internationally,\u201d said Secretary Naig.Iowa Crop ProductionCorn for grain production in Iowa for 2023 was estimated at 2.52 billion bushels, according to the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service \u2013 Crop Production 2023 Summary. Current year production was up 2 percent from the previous year's 2.47 billion bushels. Iowa's corn for grain yield was estimated at 201.0 bushels per acre.

    "relevant_documents": "\nMain Menu\nBreadcrumb\nU.S. climate outlook for September 2024\nAfter a very hot early and middle part of summer, August provided a welcome relief across much of the nation, with much-above-normal temperatures largely confined to the Deep South. The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer.\nSummer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August.\nAs we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here\u2019s the outlook from NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September.\nThe U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September.\u00a0Much warmer\u00a0or\u00a0much cooler than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nOn August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above average temperatures across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above average precipitation along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest.\nThe precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September.\u00a0Much higher\u00a0or\u00a0much lower than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nIn addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I\u2019ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here\u2019s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the most likely outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found here.\nThe updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC\u2019s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With the expected arrival of La Ni\u00f1a somewhat delayed, it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry) can influence temperatures and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks.\nTemperature outlook favors more heat in the West, uncertainty in much of the East\nThe September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. (Well above average means \u201cin the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.\u201d) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with equal chance odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions.\nThe best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is \u201cequal chances\u201d along the coast.\nIt\u2019s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so \u201cequal chances\u201d is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month.\nPrecipitation outlook tilts wet in across the South, mainly dry across the North\nThe precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-\u201cequal chances\u201d forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough.\nBelow-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods.\nU. S. Drought area increases further during August\nThe amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing extreme and exceptional drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards.\nThe summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our\u00a0Data Snapshots Collection,\u00a0based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project.\u00a0\nRegionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north.\nDrought outlook mainly predicts persistence and development, but improvement across parts of the South\nU.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See\u00a0CPC version\u00a0for Alaska and Hawaii.\nWith above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.\nTo read the entire discussion of the monthly climate outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center, check out their\u00a0website.\nWe value your feedback\nHelp us improve our content\nRelated Content\nNEWS & FEATURES\nMAPS & DATA\nTEACHING CLIMATE\nCLIMATE RESILIENCE TOOLKIT\nStay Connected\nSecretary Naig: \u201cIowa Remained a Production Powerhouse\u201d\nDES MOINES, Iowa (Jan. 12, 2024) \u2013 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig commented today on the 2023 Iowa Crop Production Annual Summary released by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service.

Corn is no exception and to ensure a future supply we must begin to understand how climate impacts both the phenological development of corn and the productivity. Temperature and precipitation are the two climate factors that will have a major benefit on corn phenology and productivity. The warming climate will accelerate the phenological development because the number of thermal units required for leaf appearance is relatively constant in the vegetative stage. Productivity of corn is reduced when extreme temperature events occur during pollination and is further exaggerated when there are water deficits at pollination. During the grain-filling period, warm temperatures above the upper threshold cause a reduction in yield. Model estimates suggest that for every 1\u00b0C increase in temperature there is nearly a 10% yield reduction. To meet world demand, new adaptation practices are needed to provide water to the growing crop and avoid extreme temperature events during the growing season. Climate change will continue to affect corn production and understanding these effects will help determine where future production areas exist and innovative adaptation practices to benefit yield stability could be utilized.\nKeywords\nAuthor Information\n*Address all correspondence to: jerry.hatfield@ars.usda.gov\n1. Introduction\nCorn (Zea mays L.) is grown throughout the world and as such is subject to a wide variety of climates and potential scenarios of climate change. Production area continues to increase in response to the increased demand for corn grain and the production per unit area (yield) has continued to increase due to enhanced technology (Figure 1). What is imperative to stability and increases in future production is understanding how climate change will impact this trend in corn production and the areas of the world where corn is produced. Corn is a grain crop with both food and feed uses and variation in production at the local scale can have major impact on local economies and local food supplies as well as world food security.\nWorld corn yield and area harvested since 1960 (data obtained from FAO stat, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en, downloaded March 8, 2018).\nWorld corn yield and area harvested since 1960 (data obtained from FAO stat, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en, downloaded March 8, 2018).\nThe trend line for corn yield has shown a steady increase and a small amount of variation among the years; however, at the local scale is where the impacts of seasonal weather and trends in climate become more noticeable. Across the United States, there have been large deviations from the trend line in years in which weather events have caused yield reductions (Figure 2). Throughout this chapter, we will focus on the impacts of climate on corn phenology and production to provide an understanding of the potential for adaptation strategies. In this chapter we will focus on three components critical to corn production: the changing climate, impact of climate on corn phenology and phenological models, and impact of climate on corn productivity.\nDeviations from the yield trend line for corn production in the United States from 1950 to 2017.

Projections of climate change\nProjections of climate change are a result of a combined set of simulation models using various scenarios of changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and the associated forcing functions [1]. The current CO2 concentrations are at nearly 400\u00a0ppm in 2018 and are projected to increase to a range of 794\u20131142\u00a0ppm by 2100 without any abatement scenarios [1]. The result of these efforts can be summarized as [1, 2]:Global mean temperatures will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century if CO2 concentrations continue to increase and under the highest emission scenario would range from 2.6 to 4.8\u00b0C.These temperatures changes will not be uniform across regions with increases over land surfaces being larger than over the oceans.As the global temperatures increase there will be more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes at both daily and seasonal time scales.Precipitation will increase with increases in global mean surface temperature and could increase 1 to 3% \u00b0C\u22121; however, there will be substantial spatial variation in these changes.The water holding capacity of air increases by 7% \u00b0C\u22121. The air can take up more water, and water vapor inclines. That leads to higher intensity of precipitation, i.e. higher amount of rainfall per rain event.Annual surface evaporation will increase as the temperatures increases; however, over land, evaporation will be linked to precipitation.\nGlobal mean temperatures will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century if CO2 concentrations continue to increase and under the highest emission scenario would range from 2.6 to 4.8\u00b0C.\nThese temperatures changes will not be uniform across regions with increases over land surfaces being larger than over the oceans.\nAs the global temperatures increase there will be more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes at both daily and seasonal time scales.\nPrecipitation will increase with increases in global mean surface temperature and could increase 1 to 3% \u00b0C\u22121; however, there will be substantial spatial variation in these changes.\nThe water holding capacity of air increases by 7% \u00b0C\u22121.

A general summary of climate impacts on crops was prepared by Hatfield et al. [3] and reveal for corn that temperature and precipitation are the two critical factors. Since corn is a C4 plant, the response to increasing CO2 will be minimal. Leakey et al. [4] found that leaf photosynthetic response was 3% to a doubling of CO2 concentrations while total biomass and grain yield increased by 4%. They did observe that leaf stomatal conductance was decreased by 34% under these same experiments. These differences in physiological activity due to increased CO2 are small compared to C3 species and will not the most evident response to the changing climate. Therefore, in this chapter we will focus on temperature and precipitation impacts on corn.\n3. Phenology of corn\nThe phenology of corn has been described as the appearance of leaves or leaf collars during the vegetative stage and accumulation of material in the grain during the reproductive stage. The developmental stages of corn has been recently described by Abendroth et al. [5] and similar guidelines are used to quantify the phenological stage of corn during the growth cycle. What is important for assessing the effect of climate on corn is to explore what role climate variables have on corn phenology. The most critical variable in phenological development is temperature and each plant has a specific range of temperatures for growth as defined as the upper and lower limit (threshold) and an optimum [3]. For corn during the vegetative stage this has been identified as 8 to 38\u00b0C with an optimum of 34\u00b0C [6, 7] while the range for the reproductive stage is 8\u201330\u00b0C [8]. Typically, the lower temperature limit in growth models has assumed to be 10\u00b0C. Survival of pollen are sensitive to temperature, e.g., temperatures exceeding 35\u00b0C have been proven detrimental to pollen viability [9, 10]. There is a strong interaction of temperature with vapor pressure deficit and the viability in the time of movement from the tassel to the silk has been shown to decrease with decreasing moisture content [11]. These results would suggest that as the temperature increases and vapor pressure deficit increases that disruption of the pollination process could become more likely especially with the potential for more extreme temperature events. Quantifying the impact of episodes of temperature extremes on pollen viability and the disruption of reproductive processes will become more important with the projection that extreme temperature events will increase under climate change (Tebabldi et al. [12]). These temperature ranges and the potential for extreme events will become important for corn growth and production because of the projection that temperatures will increase in the future.\nThe relationship of corn phenology to temperature has been described through the use of growing degree days with a growing degree day (GDD) calculated as (Tmax\u00a0+\u00a0Tmin)/2 \u2013 Tbase, where Tmax is the maximum daily temperature, Tmin is the daily minimum temperature and Tbase is the temperature at which growth stops. Kumudini et al. [13] evaluated eight different thermal models for the estimation of corn phenological development. These thermal models were classified into empirical linear typical of the GDD model first shown by Gilmore and Rogers [14] with the most robust model having a Tbase of 10\u00b0C and an optimum of 30\u00b0C. Another class of thermal models is the empirical nonlinear model described by Brown and Bootsma [15] where the following relationships were used to estimate crop heat units (CHU): if Tmin\u00a0<\u00a04.4\u00b0C then Tmin\u00a0=\u00a04.4\u00b0C to derive CHUmin\u00a0=\u00a01.8(Tmin \u2013 4.4\u00b0C); if Tmax\u00a0<\u00a010\u00b0C then Tmax\u00a0=\u00a010\u00b0C; to derive CHUmax\u00a0=\u00a03.33(Tmax \u2013 10\u00b0C) \u2013 0.084(Tmax \u2013 10\u00b0C)2 and CHU\u00a0= (CHUmax\u00a0+\u00a0CHUmin)/2. Stewart et al. [16] used a non-linear empirical model and separated the vegetative and reproductive stages of growth with different functions. The third class of thermal models can be classified as the process-based models similar to the thermal functions used in Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) as described by Wilson et al. [17] which are based on estimates of air temperature at 3 hour intervals throughout the day and given as: if T\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b0C then T\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0C and if T\u00a0>\u00a044\u00b0C then T\u00a0=\u00a044\u00b0C and calculated for different temperature ranges as 0\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a010\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a0T(10/18\u00b0C); 18\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a034\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a0T \u2013 8\u00b0C; and 34\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a044\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a026\u00b0C \u2013 (T \u2013 34\u00b0C)2.6 and thermal units are given as \u2211(IR/8), where IR\u00a0=\u00a0instantaneous rates or measurements. In comparing these different approaches, Kumudini et al. [13] found that the precision in terms of goodness of fit was calendar days < empirical linear < process-based < empirical non-linear.\nAn application of the GDD approach was developed by Neild and Richman [18] where they combined thermal units with precipitation in an agroclimatic index to determine where different corn hybrids could be grown around the world. Currently, this type of model has been replaced with simulation models similar to APSIM [19] to determine climate impacts on corn growth and production. If the thermal units per leaf appearance rate is constant for the vegetative stage of growth then as the temperature increases there will be a more rapid accumulation of leaves in the crop. This effect as observed by Hatfield [20] and Hatfield and Prueger [21] for corn grown under climatic normal (1980\u20132010) for Ames, Iowa and normal +4\u00b0C temperatures throughout the complete growing season for three different corn hybrids. There was no difference in the total number of leaf collars and cumulative leaf area between temperature regimes; however, there was a large difference in yield with the higher temperatures greatly reducing grain yield (Figure 4). Analysis revealed there was no difference in the GDD\u2019s for leaf collar appearance between the two temperature regimes suggesting that as temperatures increase there will be a more rapid rate of advancement in the phenological development with no effect on the size of the corn plant at the end of the vegetative stage. There was a large difference in grain yield between temperature regimes with a faster rate of maturity with a subsequent reduction in grain production.\nDifferences in total leaf collars, cumulative leaf area, and grain yield of three corn hybrids grown under normal Ames, Iowa temperatures and normal +4\u00b0C temperatures.

Effects of increased temperatures have shown a large degree of variation with projections of reduced production by less than 5% with temperature increases of 1\u00b0C [3] to over 50% with 4\u00b0C increases [22]. Productivity of corn is affected by temperatures exceeding 35\u00b0 C during pollination due to dehydration of the pollen [3]. Controlled environment studies have confirmed the effect of high temperatures on corn with temperatures greater than or equal to 3\u00b0C above normal temperatures showing maize yield reductions of over 50% in grain yield [20, 21]. They observed an increased rate of phenology with increased temperatures; however, the largest effect on productivity was attributed to the increase in minimum temperatures during the grain-filling period. Field studies on corn have shown under field conditions yield reductions from 13 to 88% due to increased temperature 6\u00b0C above normal temperatures [23]. The negative effects of high temperatures during the grain-filling period were attributed to pollen survivability and the efficiency of the grain-filling process. Increasing temperatures likely to be experienced under climate change demonstrate several negative effects plant growth and phenology. Lizaso et al. [24] recorded a reduction of corn yield under field and controlled conditions owing to reduced pollen viability as impacted by increased temperatures. A critical knowledge gap under future climate scenarios will be to evaluate the interaction of high temperature and increased humidity on pollen survivability and the efficiency of the pollination process. Lobell and Field [25] found maize yields decreased 8.3% per 1\u00b0C rise without any additional effect due to water stress which was confirmed by Mishra and Cherkauer [26] for Midwest corn grain yields. Challinor et al. [27] compiled a meta-analysis of over 1700 published simulations for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and corn. They found that without implementing adaptation strategies there would be a loss in yield in both temperate and tropical regions with only 2\u00b0C of warming. They also found that adaptation practices could increase simulated yields by 7\u201315% with this same temperature increase; however, the practices were more effective in wheat and rice than for corn. There was consensus among the simulation models that yield decreases were be greater in the second half of the century with the greater declines in the tropical areas compared to the temperate regions. They estimated that corn yields would decrease by nearly 15% in temperate regions with a 4\u00b0C increase and no adaptation but showed no decrease with adaptation practices [27].\nTemperature and precipitation interact to affect corn productivity. Short-term water deficits and drought reduce growth and grain yield and are often the largest cause of crop losses. In the United States, drought was related to 41% of crop losses, while excess water was attributed to 16% of the yield loss [28]. Drought stress during the early and middle reproductive stages affected grain yields and these phenological stages were found to be the most sensitive to water stress [29]. Increases in spring precipitation can cause yield reductions due to aeration stress caused by flooded soils; however, drought stress remained the primary factor linked with reduced grain production [29]. In rainfed environments where corn is primarily grown, temperature and precipitation changes under climate change will negatively impact grain production and these interactions need to be more fully understood. In an analysis of wheat production in Europe, Semenov et al. [30], stated that understanding of the effects of higher temperatures and drought stresses during the booting and flowering periods would potentially lead to adaptation practices with the potential to reduce losses in grain numbers and grain weight. With both short-term water stress and drought as major factors affecting grain yield, improved water availability through more extensive root system and changes in root architecture would benefit yield stability [31]. The excess soil moisture in the root zone will require improved soil structure to facilitate gas exchange between the root system and the atmosphere [32]. The impact of precipitation is a combination of the precipitation amount and the soil water holding capacity. This was illustrated in an analysis by Egli and Hatfield [33] where they found average county level corn yields were a function of the soils ability to supply water.\nEvaluation of corn yield response to climate is complex because of the interactions of the impacts of temperature and precipitation. To provide a more robust framework for evaluating yield response the utilization of the yield gap as the difference between potential yield and actual yield has been utilized ([34]; van Bussel et al. [35]). This concept has been discussed and utilized for several decades but recently has been extended to create a yield gap atlas for the world. The yield gap approach allows for a quantitative assessment of the ability of the crop to achieve its potential yield and the inability of closing the yield gap can often be ascribed to climatic stress. Potential yield has been defined as \u201cthe yield of a cultivar when grown in environments to which it is adapted; with nutrients and water not limiting; and with pests, diseases, weeds, and other stresses effectively controlled\u201d [36]. Potential yield (YP) is an expression of the ability of a crop canopy to convert solar radiation into dry matter with no stress during the growth cycle and radiation use efficiency can be used as a measure of this efficiency [37]. The goal of agronomic science is the evaluate practices and increasing the farmer yield (YF) may prove to be more fruitful than increasing potential yield (YP) ([38]; Lobell et al. [39]. Utilizing the yield gap approach provides a framework for evaluating the factors which affect crop yields and the phenological stage which these factors are having the most significant impact during the growing season. These studies are not simple analyses, because of the interactions of multiple factors affecting yield, and Sinclair and Ruffy [40] argue that nitrogen and water limit crop yield more than plant genetics and should be considered as the primary factors limiting yield. Understanding the yield gap requires being able to quantify both potential and actual yield and comparison among studies is often limited by the lack of consistent data and to advance our understanding of yield gaps will require standardized method for yield comparisons [41]. Fischer et al. [41] introduced attainable yield (YA) as a metric between YF and YP defined as the yield achieved by a producer under near optimum weather and management inputs. Hatfield et al. [42] utilized this approach on county level corn yields in the Midwest United States and defined the attainable yield as the years with the highest yield in the long-term record as illustrated in Figure 5. The values for attainable yield are derived by statistically fitting a line through the frontier of the yield observations and then computing the yield gap as the difference between the attainable and actual observed yield for each year. In this analysis, data from 1950 through the present are used because this represents the period of time with corn hybrids and enhanced production technology. This approach has been used for different crops and regions of the world to obtain yield gaps.\nYield gap analysis for Story County, Iowa, USA using attainable yields derived from annual production values.

(data obtained from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, www.nass.usda.gov, accessed March 8, 2018).\nHatfield et al. [42] utilized the yield gap approach for the Midwestern US to quantify the effects of climate variability on corn production and found three dominant climatic factors related to the yield gap. These were July maximum temperatures, August minimum temperatures, and July\u2013August total precipitation. Yield gaps increased when July maximum temperatures exceeded 32\u00b0C, August minimum temperatures exceeded 20\u00b0C, and July\u2013August precipitation totals decreased below 150\u00a0mm. The physiological reasons for these variables are related to the disruption of pollination (July temperatures), increased rate of senescence and reduced efficiency of grain-fill (August minimum temperatures), and water deficits during a period of the year with high crop water requirements (July\u2013August precipitation). These relationships were observed for each county in the Midwest and utilized to project the impact of future climate change on the yield gap on corn production. They found that with the trends in temperature for the summer in the Midwest US that yield gaps would exceed 50% by the year 2075 in the southern portion of the Corn Belt. There were some counties in the Midwest in which excess moisture in the spring was related to the yield gap but these relationships were not robust enough for use in projections of future climates. The yield gap framework provides a robust method for assessing the impact of climate on yield variation over time and when combined with efforts similar to those used by Challinor et al. [27] could be used to quantify the impact of adaptation practices.\n5. Agroclimatic indices to define corn production regions\nCorn is produced around the world and within these areas there may be shifts in production areas due to the changing climate. Green et al. [43] have quantified the changes in the US Corn Belt and provided a geographic analysis to depict these shifts in distribution. Development and utilization of agroclimatic indices has value in being able to assess these shifts because they are related to temperature and precipitation. Neild and Richman [18] were among the first to use the GDD concept to define potential differences among corn hybrids. Development of tools to define where crops can be produced is critical to understand crop distribution and productivity [44]. Estimation of crop distribution within arable areas is necessary to determine whether a species can thrive in an agroclimatic zone and will become more critical with the projected increases in temperature. Zomer et al. [45] extended this concept to demonstrate how climate zones could be used to evaluate technologies that would enhance the ability of management practices to offset the impacts of climate change on crop production. There have continued to be advances in the development of agroclimatic indices to evaluate the suitability of a location for a particular crop since Neild and Richman [18]. Siddons et al. [46] cautioned that development of robust agroclimatic indices requires observations collected over long time periods and extensive observations from experimental locations. There has been an evolution in agroclimatic indices to include more factors affecting plant growth and development to derive values that characterize the environment and the potential for crop production. Typical factors are: average daily minimum temperatures below 0\u00b0C; daily mean temperature to estimate crop development rates; average daily maximum temperature above 35\u00b0C to estimate exposure to heat stress, especially during pollination; average daily soil water availability (precipitation\u2013reference evapotranspiration (ET)); and length of specific phenological periods to estimate the effects of changing phenological development on biomass accumulation and crop yield [47]. They found a positive relationship between productivity and their suitability index [47]. This approach is a refinement of the effort by Neild and Richman [18] and incorporated more factors to more link crop physiological responses with phenological development.\nAgroclimatic zones are a combination of factors affecting plant growth to evaluate the potential for grain or forage crop production (e.g., [18, 44, 48?51]). The form of the index depends upon the assumption of the factors limiting growth. Soil water availability is often the determining factor in crop production in all ecosystems and the application has ranged from determination of irrigation water requirements or potential impacts on production caused by water deficits. Daccache et al. [49] incorporated soil water variability to evaluate the need for irrigation for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production in England and Wales. Their index was based on the potential soil moisture deficit (PSMD) index defined as:\nwhere PSMDi is the value in month i and PSMDi\u22121 is the value for the previous month, ETi is the reference ET for the current month calculated with the Penman-Monteith equation formulated by Allen et al. [52], and Pi the precipitation in the current month. They found increased variation in precipitation decreased potato production in an area currently suited for production, unless supplemental water was provide through irrigation. This type of analyses could be utilized to determine the need for supplemental irrigation to ensure crop production.\nAnother form of this type of framework was developed by Moeletsi and Walker [51] to quantify climate risk for corn production in South Africa. They based their index, Poone AgroClimatic Suitability Index (PACSI), on three climatic parameters; onset of rains, frost risk, and drought risk utilized a weighed distribution of climate parameters as\nwhere O is the probability planting conditions are met, FF is the probability of a frost-free growing period, and the water requirements satisfaction index (WRSI). These indices require sufficient data over a long period of record to develop the probability of the different indices to develop reliable probability assessments [46]. An aspect of this index is the assessment of drought risk which is a complex interaction by soil water holding capacity and any change in the soil affecting water availability (Eq. 2).\nPrecipitation effects on crop productivity are defined by the occurrence of the water deficits in the soil profile which fail to meet the evaporative demand. Agroclimatic indices for arid and semiarid regions are often based on precipitation amounts adequate to exceed the ET rate at the time of planting in order to ensure crop establishment [18, 47, 48, 49, 51]. Moeletsi and Walker [51] evaluated soil water dynamics based on the WRSI to determine the potential to meet crop water requirements at any phenological stage as\nwhere WRi is the water requirements for a decadal period during growing season, PETi is the potential ET during this decadal period, and kci the crop coefficient for this corresponding phenological period. For any decadal period during the growing season, the soil water balance can be used to estimate plant available water (WAi) as\nand Preci is the precipitation in a given decadal period and SWi-1 is the profile soil water content for the previous decadal period. Soil water holding capacity (WHC) becomes a critical component of this method because available SW is a function of WHC. They computed the WRSI as\nwith WDi the water deficit for decadal period i, defined as\nOr\nIn this process soil water in the profile is quantified as\nUsing this methodology, Moeletsi and Walker [51] were able to evaluate the suitability for maize production for various planting dates with a correlation of 0.8 between the PACSI and grain yields.\nPrecipitation is changing in intensity and frequency, and directly affect WAi (Eq. 3). Precipitation patterns are projected to increase in annual totals, with decreasing summer precipitation amounts over the US [1, 53]. If we link these precipitation patterns with the PACSI (Eq. 2), then corn production could become more variable among years because of soil water availability.\nUtilization of agroclimatic indices as a tool for the assessment of climate impacts on corn production areas will provide a quantitative view of shifts in production areas but potential risks to production within areas where corn is currently produced. The continued development of these tools will benefit corn production because we can evaluate the potential role of management and genetic resources on increasing yield stability over time.\n6. Simulation models to quantify climate effects\nSimulation models have been extensively used to estimate the impact of a changing climate on productivity. In 2014, Challinor et al. [27] summarized 1700 published reports using simulation models and the number of papers has increased rapidly since that time. Simulation models provide the capability of assessing the potential impacts of the change in temperature and precipitation under a given CO2 regime and often models using the different emission scenarios to determine the expected temperature and precipitation parameters which are then placed into crop simulation models [54, 55]. It has been found that an ensemble of crop models provides a more rigorous approach to estimating crop responses to climate. This is being conducted under the Agricultural Model Implementation and Improvement Project (AgMIP) framework as described by Rosenzweig et al. [56]. Bassu et al. [57] used this framework to compare 23 different corn models and found temperature decreased yield by approximately \u22120.5\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121\u00b0C\u22121 while doubling the CO2 from 360 to 720\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0mol\u22121 increased yield by 7.5% across all models and sites. They concluded that temperature increases would be the dominant factor affecting corn yields. Zhao et al. [58] summarized a number of published results and found for each 1\u00b0C increase, corn yields decreased by 7.4%. Jin et al. [59] used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model to evaluate the effect of different CO2 scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for corn production in the US and found drought will be the largest factor affecting production. However, they stated that combined impacts of temperature and water stress need to be evaluated in breeding programs and adaptation strategies [59]. Earlier, Jin et al. [60] evaluated the algorithms in 16 different corn models and concluded that heat and drought stress was best simulated when models used event-based heat and water stress descriptions, accounted for nighttime temperature stresses, and evaluated the interactions of multiple stresses. Crop models allow for an assessment of the role of genetics and management on productivity for a range of present and future environmental conditions. Hatfield and Walthall [31] utilized this concept as the G x E x M (genetics \u00d7 environment \u00d7 management) framework to determine how these interactions would need to be understood to provide food security for the future population growth.\nThere have been efforts to combine observations with crop simulation models to evaluate changes in yield and yield stability. Leng [61] found yield variability across the US Corn Belt has decreased from 1980 to 2010 with climatic variability the major factor affected variability among years and regions. He found that statistical models explained more of the yield variation than crop simulation models. Bhattarai et al. [62] used the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model with the combined results for eight general circulation models to show that under low and medium carbon scenarios, corn yields during the period 2080\u20132099 increased compared to the 2015\u20132034 period, while under the high carbon scenario yields during these same periods decreased. Lychuk et al. [63]) also used EPIC for the southeastern United States and found in the near-term corn yields increased, but from 2066 to 2070 yields decreased 5\u201313% because of the increased temperature stress. Huang et al. [64] combined field experiments with crop simulation models to evaluate the potential effect of different growing season length corn hybrids and found the longer growing season hybrid did not yield as high as the medium length hybrid. These results suggest that efforts be placed in evaluating the efficiency of plant growth relative to the changes in temperature and the accumulation of growing degree days.\nThe Global Agro-ecological zones model (GAEZ) categorizes areas suitable for crop production by climate, soil, terrain, management, and the specific growth limitations of crops, among others [65, 66]. One essential concept of GAEZ climate module is the temperature growing period (LGPt), where air temperature is used as a proxy to estimate days of the growing period with optimal, sub-optimal, and no suitable crop production conditions for a specific crop. The growing period L is defined as the number of days with average daily temperature\u00a0>\u00a05\u00b0C (i.e., LGPt5). The corn-specific LGPt\u2019s are summarized in Table 1. For example, assume a temperate corn cultivar for grain production with a total growing period between 90 and 180\u00a0days. During this period average daily air temperature shall not decrease below 5\u00b0C, and the number of days with daily average air temperature between 10 and 15\u00b0C shall be below \u215f5 of the total growing period to reach optimum growing conditions. In addition to air temperature, the length of the growing period is further limited by the moisture regime, defined as actual ET\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.5 * reference ET.\nTable 1.\nCorn growing period L (LGPt5), optimum, and sub-optimum conditions of tropical lowland, tropical highland, and subtropical and temperature cultivars for grain production, as well as subtropical and temperate cultivars for silage production.\nAdapted and simplified from [66]\nThe GAEZ model also estimates potential yield of a specific crop in a specific agro-ecological zone, and applies constraint factors, such as heat or water stress, to calculate actual yield and yield gap. For example, periods of potential water stress occur when actual ET is below the total water requirement of a crop, maximum ET, and the difference between both cannot be compensated by precipitation, plant available water, or irrigation. Maximum ET is calculated as reference ET multiplied by crop coefficient kc. Maximum ET is crop specific and changes during crop development by applying crop-development specific kc values (Figure 6). The derived water stress data is then used to calculate yield constraining factors. The GAEZ model also determines which production areas are threatened by climatic changes by applying different climatic scenarios. Using this approach, Teixeira et al. [67] estimated that 5 Mha of cropland suitable for corn production are at risk due to climate change induced heat stress, and that yield declines are expected especially in the Northern hemisphere between 40 and 60\u00b0N latitudes.\nCrop development specific kc values for corn: kc1, kc2, kc3, and kc4 applies for the initial (d1), vegetative (d2), reproductive (d3), and maturation (d4) development period, respectively. Crop coefficient kc5 applies to the end of the growing period. Corn kc2 and kc4 data are linearly interpolated between kc1, kc3, and kc5. The four corn development stages make up 15, 30, 35, and 20% of the total growing period. Data, equations, and redrawn graph according to IIASA/FAO [66]. In this example, total growing period (day of planting until harvest) was 173\u00a0days, for two corn fields nearby Ames, IA, USA from 2006 to 2017.\nCrop development specific kc values for corn: kc1, kc2, kc3, and kc4 applies for the initial (d1), vegetative (d2), reproductive (d3), and maturation (d4) development period, respectively.

Integration of these two aspects into a single framework will allow for a more complete assessment of the corn production system being experienced by producers.\n7. Conclusions\nClimate impacts on corn production due to the changing temperature and precipitation regimes in the corn growing areas. The largest impact of these changes will be at the local scale where within season weather induced by the change in climate will become more noticeable. Increasing temperatures will increase the rate of phenological development during the vegetative and reproductive stages; however, the most negative effects will be exposure to high temperatures during the pollination and grain-filling stages. The largest impact on corn production will remain linked to the availability of soil water through precipitation and variation in precipitation during the grain-filling period will have the most detrimental impact on corn production. To overcome the effects of climate change there will be shifts in areas where corn is produced; however, these shifts may not be into areas with the capacity of the soil to support high production or have large variation in yield among years due to the variation in within season weather [33]. What will be critical is to increase our understanding of the G \u00d7 E \u00d7 M interactions as suggested by Hatfield and Walthall [31] in order to reduce the risk in production from a changing climate. What will be critical will be to use our current knowledge base (i.e. genetic resources (G) and management techniques (M)) to determine the viability of potential adaptation strategies to overcome climate changes (E). Combining experimental studies with crop simulation models will advance our understanding of the complex interactions occurring between the biological system and the physical environment and guide us toward viable adaptation practices with the potential to offset the negative impacts of climate change.\nReferences\nSections\nCite this chapter\nThere are two ways to cite this chapter:\nNext chapter\nBy Amanullah and Shah Fahad\n1,343 downloads  | 4 cites\nWritten By\nSubmitted: 06 February 2018 Reviewed: 02 April 2018 Published: 10 October 2018\nCite this chapter\nThere are two ways to cite this chapter:\n\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).

    "pred_reasoning": "The total Iowa corn production in 2023 is given as 2.52 billion bushels. To convert this to million bushels, we multiply by 1,000, resulting in 2,520 million bushels. The total chapter downloads at IntechOpen in 2023 is given as 100 million downloads. The difference between these two values is 2,520 million bushels - 100 million downloads = 2,420 million.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions are not equivalent. Solution 1 converts Iowa corn production from billion to million bushels and subtracts the total chapter downloads, which is given as 2113.0, resulting in a difference of 407.0 million. Solution 2 also converts Iowa corn production to million bushels but uses a different value for total chapter downloads, 100 million, resulting in a difference of 2420.0 million. The discrepancy lies in the different values used for total chapter downloads, leading to different final answers."

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "The U.S. hospital bed occupancy rate in 2020 was 61.5 percent, and in 2022 it was 66 percent. To find the change in occupancy rate between these two years, we subtract the 2020 rate from the 2022 rate: 66 - 61.5 = 4.5. Therefore, the change in the U.S. hospital bed occupancy rate between 2020 and 2022 is an increase of 4.5 percentage points.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they identify the occupancy rates for 2020 and 2022, and then calculate the change by subtracting the 2020 rate from the 2022 rate. Both solutions arrive at the same final numerical answer of 4.5. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent in terms of reasoning and final answer."

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

    "pred_reasoning": "In 1995, there were 6,291 hospitals in operation in the United States. By 2022, this number had decreased to 6,120 hospitals. To find how many fewer hospitals there were in 2022 compared to 1995, we subtract the number of hospitals in 2022 from the number in 1995: 6,291 - 6,120 = 171. Therefore, there were 171 fewer hospitals in 2022 compared to 1995.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they identify the number of hospitals in 1995 and 2022, and then subtract the 2022 value from the 1995 value to find the difference. The final numerical answers are also equivalent, with Solution 1 providing an integer (171) and Solution 2 providing a float (171.0), which are numerically identical."

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

This formula determines the occupancy rate, providing valuable insights into bed utilization. The occupancy rate is normally calculated for specific periods such as a month or a year.\nSecond, the bed occupancy rate (BOR) method assesses the ratio of occupied beds to available beds, expressed as a percentage. To calculate BOR, divide the number of occupied beds by the total number of beds and multiply by 100. This method effectively highlights the efficiency of bed usage within a hospital.\nThird, the turnover interval (TI) method, which measures the time between a bed becoming vacant and being filled by the next patient, helps in understanding bed availability and throughput. A shorter turnover interval indicates higher efficiency.\nFourth, the bed manager\u2019s tool (BMT) involves real-time tracking software that updates bed status and predicts future occupancy trends. This dynamic approach allows for better resource allocation and immediate response to capacity issues.\nAccurately assessing hospital bed capacity ensures optimal resource use and improved patient care.\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll explore the impact of accurate bed utilization on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Understanding these effects can guide strategic decisions in health care management.\nWhat You Will Learn?\nWhat is Hospital Bed Capacity and Why Does It Matter?\nHospital bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care within a healthcare facility. This term encompasses both general and specialized beds, including those for intensive care and other critical needs.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital capacity is a key component in assessing healthcare system functionality and responsiveness. The WHO emphasizes the need for adequate hospital bed capacity to ensure quality patient care.\nHospital bed capacity includes several aspects, such as the physical space, staff availability, and the types of services offered. It directly affects patient wait times, treatment outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also notes that bed capacity is crucial for managing public health emergencies and planning healthcare resources effectively. They define it as an essential metric for healthcare quality and operational management.\nSeveral factors influence hospital bed capacity. These factors include population demographics, disease prevalence, public health initiatives, and hospital financing. Resource allocation and administrative strategies also play significant roles.\nIn the United States, as of 2022, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available, according to the American Hospital Association. Projections suggest that this number may not meet increasing healthcare demands in the coming years due to an aging population.\nLimited hospital bed capacity can lead to overcrowding, longer wait times, and compromised patient care. These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented increased hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses during winter months, affecting capacity planning.\nStaffing Levels: Staffing levels influence bed capacity since sufficient healthcare workers are necessary for proper patient care. Staffing shortages can lead to restricted bed availability, particularly in critical care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals with adequate staffing ratios can provide better care and manage capacity effectively.\nLocal Health Care Regulations: Local health care regulations can impact bed capacity and hospital operations. Regulations may dictate minimum staffing levels, licensing requirements, or limits on bed expansion. An understanding of local laws is essential for accurate capacity calculations. The Joint Commission outlines regulations that must be followed to maintain operational compliance and patient safety.\nBy considering these factors, hospitals can more accurately calculate their bed capacity and ensure they meet the needs of their communities effectively.\nWhich Types of Beds Are Included in Hospital Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospital bed capacity calculations typically include several types of beds. The main types are as follows:1. Acute Care Beds2. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds3. Rehabilitation Beds4. Long-Term Care Beds5. Observation Beds\nAcute Care Beds: Acute care beds are essential for patients who require immediate medical treatment. These beds accommodate individuals with severe health conditions or those recovering from surgeries. According to the American Hospital Association, acute care represents the majority of inpatient services, highlighting the importance of these beds in a hospital\u2019s capacity. An example is a post-operative patient who stays overnight for monitoring.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients. These beds feature advanced medical equipment and constant monitoring. The ratio of ICU beds varies worldwide, with a study in Europe showing an average of 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population. For example, a patient with severe respiratory failure may require an ICU bed for specialized care.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

(2016) showed that hospitals with improved communication processes significantly reduced patient wait times and enhanced overall efficiency. Tools such as daily huddles can ensure that everyone on the care team is informed and coordinated.\nPatient Flow Management: Patient flow management focuses on optimizing the movement of patients through the hospital system. This practice involves streamlining admission, transfer, and discharge processes. Research by McGrath et al. (2017) found that utilizing patient flow management techniques can reduce average length of stay by 15%. Hospitals may implement strategies like discharge planning meetings and real-time tracking systems to streamline patient movement.\nUtilization of Technology: Utilization of technology is essential for effective bed capacity management. Hospitals can use electronic health records (EHRs) and bed management software to gain insights into bed utilization patterns. A recent report by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) highlighted that hospitals using advanced technological solutions reduce bed turnover time by more than 30%. For instance, predictive analytics can help hospitals foresee bed occupancy and adjust staffing and resources accordingly.\nBy adopting these best practices, hospitals can improve their bed capacity management, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and efficient resource use.\nRelated Post:\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\nComment\n Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n \n\n\nmenu\nHome\nAbout Us\nBlog\nContact\nCategory\nMattress BasicsTypesUsageFurniture CompatibilityHealth & SafetyMaintenanceTransport & DeliveryBrandsRecyclingBlog\n\u00a9 2024 SleepBloom.Com All Rights Reserved\nPrivacy Policy | Disclaimer\n",

    "pred_reasoning": "In 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S. and the number of hospital beds was 920,000. To find the average number of beds per hospital, divide the total number of beds by the total number of hospitals: 920,000 beds / 6,120 hospitals = 150.33 beds per hospital.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they extract the total number of hospital beds and the total number of hospitals, then divide the total beds by the total hospitals to find the average number of beds per hospital. The final numerical answers are slightly different due to rounding: Solution 1 provides a more precise answer (150.32679738562092), while Solution 2 rounds it to two decimal places (150.33). Despite this minor difference in precision, the solutions are equivalent in terms of reasoning and the intended final answer."

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

This formula determines the occupancy rate, providing valuable insights into bed utilization. The occupancy rate is normally calculated for specific periods such as a month or a year.\nSecond, the bed occupancy rate (BOR) method assesses the ratio of occupied beds to available beds, expressed as a percentage. To calculate BOR, divide the number of occupied beds by the total number of beds and multiply by 100. This method effectively highlights the efficiency of bed usage within a hospital.\nThird, the turnover interval (TI) method, which measures the time between a bed becoming vacant and being filled by the next patient, helps in understanding bed availability and throughput. A shorter turnover interval indicates higher efficiency.\nFourth, the bed manager\u2019s tool (BMT) involves real-time tracking software that updates bed status and predicts future occupancy trends. This dynamic approach allows for better resource allocation and immediate response to capacity issues.\nAccurately assessing hospital bed capacity ensures optimal resource use and improved patient care.\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll explore the impact of accurate bed utilization on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Understanding these effects can guide strategic decisions in health care management.\nWhat You Will Learn?\nWhat is Hospital Bed Capacity and Why Does It Matter?\nHospital bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care within a healthcare facility. This term encompasses both general and specialized beds, including those for intensive care and other critical needs.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital capacity is a key component in assessing healthcare system functionality and responsiveness. The WHO emphasizes the need for adequate hospital bed capacity to ensure quality patient care.\nHospital bed capacity includes several aspects, such as the physical space, staff availability, and the types of services offered. It directly affects patient wait times, treatment outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also notes that bed capacity is crucial for managing public health emergencies and planning healthcare resources effectively. They define it as an essential metric for healthcare quality and operational management.\nSeveral factors influence hospital bed capacity. These factors include population demographics, disease prevalence, public health initiatives, and hospital financing. Resource allocation and administrative strategies also play significant roles.\nIn the United States, as of 2022, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available, according to the American Hospital Association. Projections suggest that this number may not meet increasing healthcare demands in the coming years due to an aging population.\nLimited hospital bed capacity can lead to overcrowding, longer wait times, and compromised patient care. These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented increased hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses during winter months, affecting capacity planning.\nStaffing Levels: Staffing levels influence bed capacity since sufficient healthcare workers are necessary for proper patient care. Staffing shortages can lead to restricted bed availability, particularly in critical care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals with adequate staffing ratios can provide better care and manage capacity effectively.\nLocal Health Care Regulations: Local health care regulations can impact bed capacity and hospital operations. Regulations may dictate minimum staffing levels, licensing requirements, or limits on bed expansion. An understanding of local laws is essential for accurate capacity calculations. The Joint Commission outlines regulations that must be followed to maintain operational compliance and patient safety.\nBy considering these factors, hospitals can more accurately calculate their bed capacity and ensure they meet the needs of their communities effectively.\nWhich Types of Beds Are Included in Hospital Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospital bed capacity calculations typically include several types of beds. The main types are as follows:1. Acute Care Beds2. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds3. Rehabilitation Beds4. Long-Term Care Beds5. Observation Beds\nAcute Care Beds: Acute care beds are essential for patients who require immediate medical treatment. These beds accommodate individuals with severe health conditions or those recovering from surgeries. According to the American Hospital Association, acute care represents the majority of inpatient services, highlighting the importance of these beds in a hospital\u2019s capacity. An example is a post-operative patient who stays overnight for monitoring.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients. These beds feature advanced medical equipment and constant monitoring. The ratio of ICU beds varies worldwide, with a study in Europe showing an average of 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

    "question": "In 2022, given a hospital occupancy rate of 66% in the United States, how many hospital beds were unoccupied?",
    "expected_answer": 312800.0,
    "pred_answer": 312800.0,
    "correct": true,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Total number of hospital beds available\n    total_beds = 920000\n    # Occupancy rate in percentage\n    occupancy_rate = 66\n    # Calculate the number of unoccupied beds\n    occupied_beds = (total_beds * occupancy_rate) / 100\n    unoccupied_beds = total_beds - occupied_beds\n    answer = unoccupied_beds\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "In 2022, the hospital occupancy rate in the United States was 66%. This means that 66% of the hospital beds were occupied. To find the percentage of unoccupied beds, we subtract the occupancy rate from 100%. Therefore, the percentage of unoccupied beds is 100% - 66% = 34%. According to the data, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available in the United States in 2022. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we calculate 34% of 920,000. This is done by multiplying 920,000 by 0.34, which equals 312,800. Thus, there were 312,800 unoccupied hospital beds in 2022.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions calculate the number of unoccupied hospital beds given a total number of beds and an occupancy rate. Solution 1 calculates the number of occupied beds first and then subtracts it from the total to find unoccupied beds. Solution 2 directly calculates the percentage of unoccupied beds and then applies it to the total number of beds. Both methods lead to the same final numerical answer of 312800.0 unoccupied beds. Therefore, the reasoning and final answers are equivalent."

Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family. It\u2019s devastating to the nurses. It\u2019s devastating to the physicians. It\u2019s just not a normal thing we\u2019re used to doing. And it\u2019s so impersonal, for something that\u2019s so personal.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore that experience, he said, it wouldn\u2019t even register when he heard an ambulance siren.\u00a0\n\u201cNow when I hear an ambulance go by, I feel this heaviness in the pit of my stomach of like, \u2018Is that another coronavirus patient that\u2019s going to be going into the hospital?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m emotionally exhausted by it, even though we\u2019re just getting going.\u201d\u00a0\nCalMatters COVID-19 coverage, translation and distribution is supported by generous grants from the Penner Family Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation and the California Health Care Foundation.\nRead more from CalMatters\nText\nGet breaking news on your phone.\nDownload\nKeep up with the latest via our app.\nSubscribe\nReceive updates in your inbox.\nMaricela, Montrose\nFeatured CalMatters Member\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel BeckerWater Reporter \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Becker is a journalist reporting on California\u2019s complex water challenges and water policy issues for CalMatters.

County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day \u2014 breaking the previous record set Sunday \u2014 and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n\u201cI do think that we\u2019re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,\u201d L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week \u2014 breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n\u201cLike a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,\u201d Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county\u2019s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 \u2014 the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state\u2019s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state\u2019s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients \u2014 by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but \u201cat a certain point, you run out of options, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d Simon said. \n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that\u2019s beyond a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we can\u2019t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.\u201d\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated \u201cthan just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,\u201d said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, \u201cthey make a downward adjustment \u2014 sort of, you get a penalty.\u201d\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: \u201cIf a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.\u201d\n\u201cThe ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,\u201d the department statement continued. \u201cIf a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.\u201d\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region\u2019s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That\u2019s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we\u2019re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,\u201d Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that\u2019s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders \u2014 which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining \u2014 are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n\u201cTo be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,\u201d San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. \u201cBut our window is narrowing and closing fast.\u201d\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n\u201cVaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA authorization will mean that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.\u201d\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that \u201cthe worst is not yet behind us.\u201d\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n \u2018A huge burden\u2019: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

Solution 1 directly computes this sum in a function and returns the integer result 111. Solution 2 describes the same addition process in a narrative form and provides the result as a floating-point number 111.0. Despite the difference in the format of the final answer (integer vs. floating-point), the numerical value is the same.

Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family. It\u2019s devastating to the nurses. It\u2019s devastating to the physicians. It\u2019s just not a normal thing we\u2019re used to doing. And it\u2019s so impersonal, for something that\u2019s so personal.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore that experience, he said, it wouldn\u2019t even register when he heard an ambulance siren.\u00a0\n\u201cNow when I hear an ambulance go by, I feel this heaviness in the pit of my stomach of like, \u2018Is that another coronavirus patient that\u2019s going to be going into the hospital?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m emotionally exhausted by it, even though we\u2019re just getting going.\u201d\u00a0\nCalMatters COVID-19 coverage, translation and distribution is supported by generous grants from the Penner Family Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation and the California Health Care Foundation.\nRead more from CalMatters\nText\nGet breaking news on your phone.\nDownload\nKeep up with the latest via our app.\nSubscribe\nReceive updates in your inbox.\nMaricela, Montrose\nFeatured CalMatters Member\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel BeckerWater Reporter \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Becker is a journalist reporting on California\u2019s complex water challenges and water policy issues for CalMatters.

County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day \u2014 breaking the previous record set Sunday \u2014 and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n\u201cI do think that we\u2019re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,\u201d L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week \u2014 breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n\u201cLike a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,\u201d Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county\u2019s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 \u2014 the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state\u2019s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state\u2019s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients \u2014 by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but \u201cat a certain point, you run out of options, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d Simon said. \n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that\u2019s beyond a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we can\u2019t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.\u201d\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated \u201cthan just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,\u201d said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, \u201cthey make a downward adjustment \u2014 sort of, you get a penalty.\u201d\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: \u201cIf a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.\u201d\n\u201cThe ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,\u201d the department statement continued. \u201cIf a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.\u201d\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region\u2019s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That\u2019s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we\u2019re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,\u201d Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that\u2019s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders \u2014 which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining \u2014 are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n\u201cTo be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,\u201d San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. \u201cBut our window is narrowing and closing fast.\u201d\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n\u201cVaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA authorization will mean that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.\u201d\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that \u201cthe worst is not yet behind us.\u201d\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n \u2018A huge burden\u2019: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n\u201cVaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA authorization will mean that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.\u201d\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that \u201cthe worst is not yet behind us.\u201d\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n \u2018A huge burden\u2019: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

Staying home and preventing coronavirus infections will help hospitals manage the influx of patients. As officials wait and hope for the stay-at-home order to tame the surge, they are anxiously tracking ICU capacity.\nAdvertisement\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about ICU capacity and why it\u2019s important at this stage of the pandemic.\nFive things you need to know about COVID-19\nUPDATED\u00a0Oct. 2, 2020 | 5:15 PM\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\nA lot of them are the same as symptoms of a cold or the flu: cough, sore throat, congestion or a runny nose, fatigue, muscle or body aches, fever or chills, and shortness of breath. A person with COVID-19 may also experience diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, or a new loss of taste or smell. In cases of serious illness, it can take time for symptoms to worsen.\nHow long does it take for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed to the coronavirus?\nThe first symptoms can appear in as few as two days, but it can also take as long as two weeks, according to the CDC. An incubation period of four or five days is more typical. However, a significant proportion of people who are infected \u2014 perhaps as much as 45% \u2014 never develop any symptoms, researchers say.\nWhat should I do if I think I'm infected?\nIf you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you\u2019ve been in close contact with someone who has it, the CDC recommends that you get a coronavirus test. Until you get your test results, you should assume you are infected. That means staying at home as much as possible so that you don\u2019t risk infecting others. Of course, if you\u2019re having a medical emergency, don\u2019t be afraid to call 911.  \nSome diagnostic tests look for genetic evidence of the virus in a sample of saliva or a specimen collected from the nose or throat. Others can detect specific coronavirus molecules that prompt the immune system to produce infection-fighting antibodies.\nHow can I reduce my risk of infection?\nLimit contact with people outside of your household. When you do go out, wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth and stay at least six feet away from others whenever possible. Clean your hands frequently by using soap and water for 20 seconds or a sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are dirty. At home, clean and disinfect tables, doorknobs, faucets and other frequently touched surfaces once a day.\nHow did the pandemic start?\nScientists think it began with a close relative of the novel coronavirus that has been circulating in bats and other animals for so long that it no longer makes them sick. That virus must have gained a key mutation that allowed it to infect humans. Health officials in China reported the first cases of the respiratory illness that came to be known as COVID-19 in December 2019. The first known case in Los Angeles was in January. California has had more than 800,000 confirmed cases since.\nWhat is an ICU?\nAn ICU, or intensive care unit, is a specialized hospital department that cares for people in the most critical health situations, such as those with life-threatening injuries or severe illnesses. ICUs are equipped with specialized equipment, such as ventilators.\nMost important, ICUs are staffed with highly trained nurses and physicians who provide round-the-clock care to their patients \u2014 checking their breathing, blood pressure, fluids and other vital signs. Dr. Shruti Gohil, an infectious disease specialist at UCI Health, said there is a 1-to-1 ratio of nurses to patients in ICUs.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThat kind of minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour care requires a level of training on the nurses to ... recognize problems quickly and address them quickly and then know what needs to be done while waiting,\u201d Gohil said.\nA COVID-19 patient with severe difficulty breathing may require ventilator support in an ICU.\n\u201cWe are responding at the moment to a tsunami of COVID-19 patients in the hospital,\u201d said Carmela Coyle, president and chief executive of the California Hospital Assn. \u201cBut that does not stop the heart attacks, the strokes, the cancer patients with serious, immediate needs.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhat is ICU capacity?\nCapacity is the number of staffed beds available at a point in time.\nDetermining whether capacity has been reached is more nebulous.\nThe state determines a region\u2019s ICU capacity with a weighted formula to ensure that some ICU beds remain open for non-COVID patients. When the state says a region has reached 0%, it may actually still have some beds available. Individual counties, such as Fresno, have reported having no open ICU beds.\nCapacity also fluctuates as patients exit the ICU and others enter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always sort of this movement that\u2019s not always quite captured by the snapshots that we get,\u201d said Dr. Rais Vohra, interim health officer for Fresno County. \u201cOverall, the capacity is severely impacted.\u201d\nWhat happens when an ICU reaches 0% capacity?\nHospitals will likely place patients in open beds elsewhere in the hospital, such as emergency department rooms.\nHaving open beds in other parts of the hospital does not mean a hospital is equipped to handle more intensive care patients. Dr. Bill Stringer, chief pulmonologist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, said the \u201climiting step is not going to be space or equipment. It\u2019s going to be staff.\u201d\nBecause of their specialized training in high-intensity situations, ICU medical professionals are scarce resources.\n\nCalifornia\nHere\u2019s what the ICU ward looks like with 0% availability\nICU availability in Southern California at 0%, and the crisis is expected to get worse, officials warn.\nDec. 21, 2020\n\u201cThe problem is, we\u2019ve got a nationwide shortage of critical care nurses,\u201d Coyle said. \u201cIt is not the case where you can pull any nurse into the ICU to provide that level of care.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAnd when ICUs are stretched beyond capacity, the quality of care can decline and mortality rates can rise.\nAs ICU capacity shrinks, a hospital is likely to scale back elective procedures, freeing up staff. Some healthcare workers \u2014 such as those who work in trauma, surgery and anesthesia \u2014 are already trained for high-stress scenarios, so they would be \u201cnatural pivots\u201d to the ICU, Gohil said. A critical care professional would supervise.\n\u201cIn a poor, catastrophic state, it would be an all-hands-on-deck approach,\u201d Gohil said.\nIf a hospital\u2019s beds fill, some patients may be transferred to neighboring hospitals. But moving ICU patients is risky, Stringer said.\n\u201cJust imagine somebody who is just completely inert, that is sedated, that is being supported at least with a ventilator,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most fragile and vulnerable patient being transferred. That\u2019s a very difficult decision.\u201d\nHow do I find out the ICU capacity where I live?\nThe state keeps an updated list of ICU bed availability by county.\nHospitals report their capacities daily, and the state tallies them.\nHere are the regional numbers as of Thursday afternoon:\n\nSouthern California: 7.7%, down from 9% Wednesday\nSan Joaquin Valley: 1.9%, down from 4.2%\nGreater Sacramento: 13.3%, down from 14.3%\nBay Area: 17.8%, down from 20.9%\nNorthern California: 30.3%, an improvement from 27.1%\n\nI live in a region where ICU space is at capacity, but I have a medical emergency. What do I do?\nYou should still seek help. If you\u2019re in a serious emergency, call 911.\nAdvertisement\nOtherwise, Stringer said, call the hospital emergency departments near you to check their capacity. Then wear a mask and go.\n\u201cThe hospital, even though we have plenty of COVID patients, is still a safe place to get care,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not as safe as being on a backpacking trip in the Rockies. But if you\u2019ve got an emergency, you need to call.\u201d\nMore to Read\n\n\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new coronavirus wave is disrupting lives, even with less severe illness\nJune 1, 2022\n*    \nAnother bummer coronavirus summer for California?

    "pred_reasoning": "On December 10, 2020, L.A. County reported 74 new COVID-19 deaths. On the same day, the ICU availability percentage in Northern California was 30.3%. To find the difference, subtract the ICU availability percentage from the number of new deaths: 74 - 30.3 = 43.7.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions involve the same reasoning steps: they extract the numerical values for COVID-19 deaths in L.A.

This review explores the relationship between nurse-patient ratios and various outcomes in healthcare settings, including patient morbidity and mortality, nurse job satisfaction, and overall care quality. By synthesizing current literature, the review highlights the impact of staffing levels on patient care and nurse well-being, and discusses potential strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to enhance healthcare delivery. This involves regular assessment of healthcare outcomes, patient satisfaction, and compliance with clinical guidelines. Healthcare organizations often use quality improvement methodologies, such as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles and Six Sigma, to identify areas for improvement, implement changes, and measure the impact of those changes. These methodologies provide a structured approach to problem-solving and facilitate the systematic improvement of healthcare processes.\nKeywords: Healthcare quality \u2022 Patient safety \u2022 Nurse job satisfaction \u2022 Healthcare delivery *Address for Correspondence: Christmal Dela, Department of Health Sciences, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa; E-mail: christmal.\nchristmals23@nwu.ac.za Copyright: \u00a9 2024 Dela C.

Adequate staffing levels ensure that nurses can provide thorough and attentive care, which is essential for positive patient outcomes. Conversely, inadequate nurse-patient ratios can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality, nurse burnout, and reduced quality of care. As healthcare systems globally grapple with resource constraints and increasing patient demands, understanding the impact of nurse-patient ratios is paramount for policy-making and healthcare management. This paper reviews existing literature on nurse-patient ratios, examining their influence on healthcare quality and patient safety. The goal is to identify the key outcomes associated with varying staffing levels and propose strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to improve healthcare delivery [1].\nLiterature Review Research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between nurse-patient ratios and patient outcomes. Studies have shown that lower nurse-patient ratios are associated with decreased patient morbidity and mortality. That improved nurse staffing levels significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers, and patient falls. Nurse Job satisfaction and retention are also influenced by nurse-patient ratios. High patient loads can lead to increased stress, burnout, and job dissatisfaction among nurses. This not only affects the well-being of nurses but also impacts patient care, as high turnover rates can disrupt continuity and quality of care. Healthcare quality, as measured by patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, is closely tied to nurse staffing levels. Hospitals with adequate nurse-patient ratios tend to have higher patient satisfaction scores, as patients receive more personalized and timely care. Additionally, better-staffed units often experience fewer medical errors and higher adherence to clinical guidelines [2].\nDiscussion Optimizing nurse-patient ratios is essential for enhancing healthcare quality and patient safety. Several strategies can be employed to achieve this goal. First, implementing mandated staffing ratios, as seen in California, where legislation requires specific nurse-to-patient ratios in hospitals, can ensure a baseline standard for staffing levels. Research indicates that these regulations have led to improved patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction. Second, employing flexible staffing models that adjust to patient acuity and census can help manage workload more effectively. Utilizing data-driven tools to predict patient needs and adjust staffing accordingly ensures that resources are allocated efficiently. Third, investing in nurse workforce development is crucial. Providing ongoing education, career development opportunities, and supportive work environments can enhance nurse retention and attract new entrants to the profession. This, in turn, can help maintain adequate staffing levels [3].\nFinally, leveraging technology to support nursing practice can alleviate some of the burdens associated with high patient loads. Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telehealth, and other digital tools can streamline documentation, facilitate communication, and enhance care coordination, allowing nurses to focus more on direct patient care. Healthcare quality and safety are fundamental aspects of healthcare delivery that ensure patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Quality in healthcare refers to the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes consistent with current professional knowledge. Safety, a crucial component of quality, involves minimizing risks, errors, and harm to patients during the provision of healthcare services. Together, healthcare quality and safety form the bedrock of effective medical practice and patient care. A key element of healthcare quality is the implementation of evidence-based practices. These practices are rooted in the best available scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values. By adhering to evidence-based guidelines, healthcare providers can ensure that the treatments and interventions they offer are both effective and efficient. For instance, the use of standardized protocols for managing chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension has been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications. Similarly, adherence to surgical checklists has been proven to significantly decrease surgical errors and infections [4].\nPatient safety initiatives aim to create a safe healthcare environment by preventing and reducing risks, errors, and harm that can occur during patient care. These initiatives encompass a range of strategies, including the development of safety protocols, the use of technology to prevent errors, and the promotion of a culture of safety within healthcare organizations. For example, the implementation of Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems has been instrumental in reducing medication errors by ensuring accurate and legible prescriptions. Additionally, the use of barcoding systems Adv Practice Nurs, Volume 09:03, 2024 Page 2 of 2 Dela C.\nfor medication administration ensures that patients receive the correct medications at the appropriate dosages. A critical aspect of healthcare quality and safety is the continuous monitoring and improvement of healthcare processes [5].\nAnother vital component of healthcare quality is patient-centered care. This approach involves respecting patients' preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that they guide all clinical decisions. Patient-centered care emphasizes the importance of effective communication, shared decision-making, and providing compassionate and respectful care. By involving patients in their care, healthcare providers can improve patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment plans, and overall health outcomes. Healthcare quality and safety are also influenced by the work environment and culture within healthcare organizations. A supportive work environment that promotes teamwork, open communication, and continuous learning is essential for ensuring high-quality and safe patient care. Organizations that prioritize staff well-being, provide ongoing education and training, and encourage reporting and learning from errors is better positioned to deliver safe and effective care. Moreover, regulatory bodies and accreditation organizations play a significant role in promoting healthcare quality and safety. These entities establish standards and guidelines that healthcare organizations must adhere to and conduct regular inspections and evaluations to ensure compliance. Accreditation by organizations such as The Joint Commission signifies that a healthcare facility meets high standards of care and safety [6]. Conclusion The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. Adequate staffing levels are associated with better patient outcomes, higher nurse job satisfaction, and overall improved healthcare delivery. By implementing mandated staffing ratios, employing flexible staffing models, investing in workforce development, and leveraging technology, healthcare organizations can optimize nurse-patient ratios to enhance patient care and nurse well-being. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, prioritizing adequate nurse staffing will remain essential for ensuring high-quality, safe, and effective patient care.\nAcknowledgement None.\nConflict of Interest None.\nHow to cite this article: Dela, Christmal. \u201cThe Impact of Nurse-patient Ratios on Healthcare Quality and Safety.\u201d Adv Practice Nurs 9 (2024): 387.\nReferences 1.

The hope is they will stay and practice medicine in El Paso after medical school and residency.\n\"I really hope to provide a perspective and knowledge to the community here and help to serve patients who might otherwise have to leave because there aren't as many doctors here and I'd like to slowly but surely help keep more patients here,\" Pi\u00f1on said.\nEl Paso County, which includes the city of the same name, is among the 95% of Texas counties that have a shortage of primary-care physicians. They're not alone \u2014 just shy of 100 million Americans live in an area with a shortage of primary-care physicians. And demand for medical care is growing as the American population ages, outstripping supply.\nThe shortages are especially dire in rural areas, where 20% of Americans live but only 10% of doctors practice. The program in Texas for high-school students is adding needed doctors to the primary-care-physician pipeline and could offer a model for other communities facing similar challenges.\nFederal funding could aid and expand the healthcare workforce, but it may not be enough to meet the demand among rural populations. One key to addressing the lack of physicians could be a \"homegrown\" approach to making \u2014 and keeping \u2014 more doctors, nurses, and other clinicians in the areas where they are needed most through mentorship opportunities and state- and privately funded scholarships.\nLimits to the industry's education system leave some medical students without jobs\u00a0\nThe number of students enrolled in medical school grew by 9% between 2010 and 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics \u2014 plus another 3% from 2021 to the 2022-23 academic year, according to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges. But the US is on track to have a shortage of around 48,200 to 73,700 doctors by 2024, according to the AAMC. That number could increase to as high as 124,000 by 2034.\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \nWhile the number of medical students and residents has risen, it's not fast enough to keep up with the increasing demand for care as record numbers of clinicians leave the workforce because of pandemic burnout or retirement.\nDr. Atul Grover, the executive director of the AAMC Research and Action Institute, told Insider this demand was because the federal government arbitrarily capped its share of the costs for medical training in the late '90s.\nFor example, federal funding for residency programs was largely capped in 1997 \u2014 on the heels of worries that the US would have a surplus of doctors \u2014 and has only recently been modestly increased.\nThere was a record 40,375 residency spots for the graduating class of 2023, but it still wasn't enough for all 42,952 graduate applicants to match, meaning nearly 2,600 prospective doctors were left without an opportunity.\nRural areas are prioritized for new residency spots but expected to struggle to bring in new talent, considering that 98% of residency positions in 2020 were at urban hospitals, a Government Accountability Office study found.\nAnd while diversity among medical students is improving, underserved patients of color are still far less likely to get to see a doctor who looks like them, which is linked to better care and outcomes.\nHit with drastic shortages, rural states are investing in medical students from early ages\nFor physicians, \"there is a bit of a geographic battle,\" Grover said, adding: \"We need to figure out how to serve the needs of rural populations \u2014 which we've been trying to do for the past 50 years and it hasn't worked \u2014 and we can't just diversify the healthcare workforce starting in medical school; even high school is almost too late.\"\nInvesting in and keeping the next generation of doctors is the mission of a partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso and the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso.\nThis first cohort is a proof-of-concept. Students will be guided through the process up until admission, which includes a guaranteed interview. If all goes well, they and future students in the program will have a sure path to medical school.\u00a0\nWith considerable sponsorship from local businesses, the pair of universities organize opportunities for El Paso kids to get hands-on exposure to the healthcare industry, starting in elementary school. As part of its new MedFuture program, five high-school students are given preliminary acceptance to medical school (as long as they maintain a qualifying grade-point average), access to summer research opportunities throughout their college years at the University of Texas at El Paso, and help preparing for the MCAT.\n\"Many of the students are first-generation immigrants; they have not had exposure to healthcare professions or how to get there,\" Dr. Richard Lange, the president of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso and dean of the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine, told Insider.\u00a0\nLange said the program selected students with an interest in supporting their community. The idea, he added, is that those participants will have a higher likelihood of staying after medical school and residency.\u00a0\nIt's up to the students to decide whether they want to go on to medical school, but there are plenty of incentives for them to attend a program in Texas. A large portion of the class at the Foster School of Medicine receives scholarships from a $50 million endowment, Lange said.\nAs of 2020, more than 80% of students who went to medical school and did their residencies in Texas stayed in state to practice medicine, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Lange told Insider he estimated that about 15% of graduates from the Foster School of Medicine were placed in residency programs in the El Paso area.\nAnd that benefits patients beyond an increase in the number of physicians in the region, Dr. Cynthia Perry, associate academic dean for admissions at the Foster School of Medicine told Insider. \"For us, it's about cultural competency,\" she said. \"The students that are from our region and go on to train and practice here relate to their patients and understand the obstacles these patients have to endure.\"\u00a0\nMedFuture students are uniquely suited to help patients navigate El Paso's particular system and take advantage of resources a physician from elsewhere might be unaware of, she added.\u00a0\nSome states bootstrap additional residency spots and medical-school scholarships\u00a0\nEven as medical-school graduates nationwide face the limits of residency-match spots, Texas is uniquely positioned. For each in-state medical-school graduate, the state has 1.1 residency spots per graduate, set by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. While there are technically 1.82 slots per graduate nationwide, according to the National Resident Matching Program, this number includes international applicants \u2014 so there are only 0.85 slots per American graduate.\nTexas hospitals have accomplished this by taking advantage of a Medicare policy that provides additional funds for new residency programs, while funded slots in existing programs are capped. The state does the same.\u00a0\nSince 2016, six medical schools have opened in Texas. The number of residency programs in Texas has increased by 49% in the past decade, outpacing the 41% national growth rate.\n\"The state has been very generous in funding these graduate-medical-education programs to make sure that if these students want to stay here, they can,\" Lange said.\nTexas' model is working, and Grover told Insider he saw similar local efforts produce \"homegrown\" doctors from a young age and incentivize them to practice in shortage areas across the country.\u00a0\nWhile about 20% of people in El Paso are estimated to live in poverty, the city benefits from medical-education funding provided by the state, which has the second-highest GDP in the country. But state funding won't go as far in poorer states with even-worse physician shortages and higher rates of premature deaths, heart disease, obesity, and overall poor health, including Mississippi or Louisiana.\u00a0\n\"We need to figure out how to fortify the pipeline of new physicians, and we need to figure out how to make full use of everyone in all the healthcare professionals,\" Grover said.\n\n                              Read next\n                            \nJump to\nIndustry Overview\nDigital & Trend reports\nOverview and forecasts on trending topics\nIndustry & Market reports\nIndustry and market insights and forecasts\nCompanies & Products reports\nKey figures and rankings about companies and products\nConsumer & Brand reports\nConsumer and brand insights and preferences in various industries\nPolitics & Society reports\nDetailed information about political and social topics\nCountry & Region reports\nAll key figures about countries and regions\nMarket forecast and expert KPIs for 1000+ markets in 190+ countries & territories\nInsights on consumer attitudes and behavior worldwide\nBusiness information on 100m+ public and private companies\nDetailed information for 39,000+ online stores and marketplaces\nDirectly accessible data for 170 industries from 150+ countries and over 1 Mio. facts.\nStatista+ offers additional, data-driven services, tailored to your specific needs.

California currently has the most number of active physicians of any U.S. state, with around 125,566 physicians. In California, the specialties with the most physicians are psychiatry, emergency medicine, and anesthesiology. \nSpecialty areas\nIn general, the most common specialty areas for physicians in the U.S. are emergency medicine, psychiatry, surgery, and anesthesiology. As of 2024, there were around 58,900 psychiatrists in the U.S. Concerning the gender distribution of specialty physicians, males out number females in almost every specialty, with exceptions found in mainly in various pediatric disciplines, and obstetrics and gynecology. \nCompensation\nThe specialty areas with the highest average annual compensation are plastic surgery, orthopedics, and cardiology. As of 2024, a physician in orthopedics earned an average of 558,000 U.S. dollars per year. Male physicians still earn more than their female counterparts in both primary care and specialty settings. This difference is especially large in specialty settings where male physicians earn more than 100,000 dollars more per year than female physicians.\n\n                        Leading 10 U.S. states with the most number of active physicians as of 2024\n                    \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nJuly 2024\nUnited States\nas of January 2024\nData includes currently active allopathic physicians (MDs) and osteopathic physicians (DOs).\r\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\r\n\nOther statistics on the topic\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nNumber of specialty physicians in the U.S. 2024, by field of specialty\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nNumber of physicians in the U.S. by specialty and gender 2021\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nTotal active physicians in the U.S. 2024, by state\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nAnnual compensation of U.S. physicians by specialty 2024\n* For commercial use only\n\n                            Basic Account\n                        \n\n                            Starter Account\n                        \n\n                            Professional Account\n                        \n1\n                        All prices do not include sales tax.
