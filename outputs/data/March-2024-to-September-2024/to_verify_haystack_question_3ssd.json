It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

To that point, TSLA is still up +14% in the last three months to outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +1% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRecent Performance Overview\nTesla\u2019s stock has stayed in correction territory following its Q2 earnings of $0.52 a share which decreased -43% from EPS of $0.91 in the comparative quarter. This also missed Q2 EPS estimates of $0.62 by -16%.\nQuarterly sales did reach a record of $25.5 billion which was a 2% increase from $24.92 billion in Q2 2023 and beat expectations by 1%. Price cuts to its EV fleet led to lower margins with CEO Elon Musk stating an increasing number of competitors have entered the market and offered substantial discounts in an attempt to undercut Tesla.\nThe auto giant does see this as a short-term headwind with annual earnings now expected to decline -26% this year but projected to rebound and climb 36% in fiscal 2025 to $3.14 per share.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Technical Tape & Valuation\nUnderlying the recent bearish move in Tesla\u2019s stock is that TSLA moved below its 50-day\u00a0simple moving average (SMA) of $209 and continued to fall after dipping beneath its\u00a0200-day\u00a0SMA of $201. Traders will certainly want to see TSLA retake these levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, the correction has helped to normalize Tesla\u2019s valuation with TSLA trading at 87.1X forward earnings which is 38% below its two-year high of 141.2X and closer to the median of 76.7X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nTesla\u2019s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The EV pioneer's long-term outlook is still attractive but TSLA remains in correction territory and there could be better buying opportunities ahead. That said, the leveling of Tesla\u2019s valuation should start to attract more investors.\nSee More Zacks Research for These Tickers\nNormally $25 each - click below to receive one report FREE:\nTesla, Inc.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.10%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 7, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.\nVisit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.\nVisit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.\nReal time prices by BATS.
