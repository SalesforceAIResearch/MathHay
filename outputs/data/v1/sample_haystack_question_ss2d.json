This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.

Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.

Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",

The month began colder than normal across the UK, with temperatures across the UK cooler than average and southern areas recording notably low daily minimum temperatures (for instance, Benson in Oxfordshire recorded -4.6\u00b0C on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd across parts of south west England, causing some travel disruption. However, the cool weather was replaced with milder weather for much of the rest of the month, with temperatures widely into the mid to high teens at times (for instance, a maximum of 18.8\u00b0C was recorded at Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th). Temperatures dipped again towards the end of the month, and on the 27th/28th, some areas around Plymouth and Dartmoor experienced snowy conditions overnight. Overall the weather was unsettled, with a succession of frontal systems bringing rain and wind. By mid-month, several counties including London and Kent had already provisionally experienced their whole-month average rainfall, and continued to be soaked throughout the rest of the month. The month ended on an unsettled note, with widespread showers and strong winds across the UK. Overall, the provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was much milder than areas further north, with a provisional mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C (anomaly of 1.4\u00b0C) for southern England and 5.0\u00b0C (anomaly of 0.6\u00b0C) for Scotland. England provisionally recorded the seventh-warmest March on record in a series from 1884. The UK overall recorded provisionally 127% of the long term average rainfall for March, with much of this concentrated in the south. England and Wales both recorded more than 150% of their long term average monthly rainfall, while Scotland recorded just 90% of the average March rainfall. County Down in Northern Ireland provisionally experienced its third wettest March on record (145.9mm) in a series from 1836. As well as wet, the month was also dull, with the UK provisionally recording just 95.2 hours of sunshine (87% of the long term average). Reference climatology used for calculating anomalies is the period 1991-2020 unless otherwise stated. Weather impacts \u2022 Snow across Ireland, southwest Midlands and the Bristol area caused traffic disruption and road closures \u2022 Persistent rain across the country throughout the month, particularly in southern England, caused groundwater and surface water flooding March started with heavy snow across southern and western parts of Northern Ireland, with the Enniskillen area reporting numerous traffic incidents and several fallen trees as a result of the snow. Parts of the Peak District and south Pennines also experienced snow, with several roads reported closed for a period. Further south, a heavy hail storm in Sussex on the 1st may have contributed to a major road traffic collision on the M23. Further snow on the 2nd hit the south-western Midlands and Bristol area, with reports of several snow-related traffic incidents and the use of snow ploughs to clear a section of the M4. The rest of the month saw unsettled weather with regular bouts of rain. Ongoing groundwater flooding in Suffolk that began in February continued well into March, bringing significant traffic disruption. However, there was otherwise relatively little in the way of impactful rain up until the final week of the month. The last week of March brought rain, snow, and strong winds. Heavy rain in Cornwall on the 25th/26th as a result of a stalling weather front led to flooding; the Cornwall Fire and Rescue service reported rescuing six people from flooding incidents on the roads which included rescues from flooded cars. On the 27th, the rain turned to snow across southwest England, leading to travel disruption including reports of abandoned vehicles around Dartmoor and further road disruption in mid-Wales as the area of precipitation moved north. Strong winds and locally intense rainfall on the 28th affected southern areas of Wales and England, resulting in several incidents of surface water flooding that led to the closure of several roads in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire to allow the floodwater to drain. The month closed with scattered heavy showers on the 29th, before the weather settled a little over the Easter weekend.

The wind anomaly map shows shaded (scalar) wind speed anomalies with arrows as (vector) wind anomalies. Text not available. Weather diary \u2022 Low pressure dominating, wet and windy The weather pattern for March was characterized by a series of Atlantic low pressure systems crossing the country through the month with just a brief settled spell during the 2nd week and the occasional transient ridge of high pressure. Wet and windy was the order of the day on the 1st with a deep low crossing central England, producing significant rainfall across all regions, and some very strong winds for the south coast, gusts to 80mph being reported in places. Low pressure continued to dominate through to the 6th. By the 7th, high pressure had become established over Scandinavia and the UK fell under the influence of a continental easterly until the 11th. The consequence of that was northern parts of England and all of Scotland remained mostly dry but cold, and any weather systems were pushed south, bringing more wind and rain to southern and southwestern counties. However, by the 13th, the high pressure had all but vanished, allowing a mobile westerly airstream to resume over the UK with the latest system bringing heavy and persistent rain particularly to Northern Ireland, north Wales and northwest England. Parts of Snowdonia saw nearly 100mm of rain over a 24 hour period. From the 13th to the 25th, the UK was hit by a series of depressions, with their attendant fronts bringing more wind and rain across all regions. After the 20th, the trajectory of the lows changed to approach the UK from a more southerly direction. The resulting southwesterly winds finally brought some milder conditions, with maximum temperatures widely into the mid-teens Celsius, slightly higher over southern England. After the 25th and to the end of the month, a north-south split was evident with Scotland subject to a cold and showery northeasterly airstream, with the rest of the UK milder but very wet at times. Notes The Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884, and this report forms a continuation of that series. The purpose of each report is to provide an overview of the weather conditions across the UK for that month. The emphasis is mainly based on observations from the surface network of weather stations. Climate series based on from data from these stations are used to provide long term context. This summary was produced on 03/04/2024 14:28. The statistics are a provisional assessment of the observational data available at the time of production. Ongoing data receipt and quality assurance processes may result in subsequent updates to the statistics presented. If you have any questions or feedback about this product, spot any data errors or omissions, or wish to obtain further data, please contact the Met Office. For historical monthly weather reports please visit the Library and Archive. o The land-surface observations presented in this report are from the Met Office official weather station network which includes both automatic weather stations and manual climate stations operated by volunteer observers. Rainfall data are from the official registered rain-gauge network which includes rain-gauges operated by a number of key partners including the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and Northern Ireland Water. o The observations are carefully managed such that they conform to current best-practice observational standards as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The observations also pass through a range of quality assurance procedures at the Met Office before application for climate monitoring. o Daily and monthly maps, monthly statistics and monthly time-series are primarily based on the HadUK-Grid dataset of 1km resolution UK gridded climate data (Hollis et al, 2019). Monthly statistics from the monthly Central England temperature series 1659 (Manley, 1974) and England and Wales precipitation series from 1766 (Wigley et al, 1984) provide long term context. o The monthly lightning activity map is based on data from the Met Office ATDnet (Arrival Time Difference Network) system. This is an automatic lightning location network comprising around ten lightning outstation sensors located across Europe. o The monthly maps of mean sea level pressure and 250hPa wind speed and direction are based on the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al, 2019). ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades.

    "Document2": "Brazil \u2013 Extreme Rainfall Days in Metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo Have Risen Four-Fold\nStudy by researchers at Brazil\u2019s National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) reveals that etreme rainfall days in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have risen four-fold in seven decades. The research also shows a rise in the number of consecutive dry days, suggesting that extreme rainfall events are concentrated in shorter, more widely spaced periods.\nExtreme rainfall has become increasingly common in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The capital of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in the southern hemisphere. The metropolitan area suffered from flooding due to heavy rain in February. Early in the month, no less than 114 millimeters (mm) fell in a single 24-hour period. This was the second highest 24-hour amount for the month since 1943, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET).\nAccording to a study by researchers at the Natural Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN), an agency of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC), both the total rainfall and the frequency of extreme rainfall events in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have increased significantly in the last seven decades.\nWhile there were practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s, such days have occurred between twice and five times per year in the last ten years in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, according to the authors.\nThe study was supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation \u2013 FAPESP under the aegis of its Research Program on Global Climate Change (RPGCC). The findings are reported in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.\nResearchers affiliated with INMET, the National Space Research Institute (INPE) and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG-USP) also took part in the study.\n\u201cIntense rainstorms lasting a few hours with huge amounts of water, as much as 80 mm or 100 mm, are no longer sporadic events. They\u2019re happening more and more frequently,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo, a senior researcher at CEMADEN and principal investigator for the study, told.\nThe researchers analyzed data collected by INMET\u2019s weather stations at IAG-USP and Santana Lookout in the northern part of the city. The analysis showed an increase in the number of days with heavy rain and in the frequency of rainfall extremes, especially during the rainy season (spring-summer).\nThe dry season used to occur between April and September in most of the state but has lasted until October in recent decades. The number of consecutive days without any rain at all has also gradually increased, suggesting that heavy rainfall events are concentrated in fewer days, interrupted by longer periods of hot dry weather.\nWith fewer cold nights and more hot days, convective rainfall is more likely to occur, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall, the authors note.\nIn convective rainfall, the ground heats up, boosting evaporation and causing warm moist air to rise (convection). As the air ascends, it cools and forms convective clouds, which precipitate upon reaching saturation.\n\u201cWe observed a long-term trend in this kind of weather event, with very strong signs that climate change is in progress,\u201d Marengo said.\nRecords from the IAG-USP and Santana Lookout weather stations showed a four-fold increase in the number of days with rainfall exceeding 100 mm between 2000 and 2018 compared with those from the 1940s or 1960s.\nRecords from IAG-USP also showed an increase in total rainfall, in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, and in the frequency of consecutive dry days in the period 1931-2017.\n\u201cThis suggests that the increase in total rainfall in S\u00e3o Paulo in recent decades was due to an increase in \u2018heavy\u2019 precipitation, concentrated in fewer days and with longer dry spells in between,\u201d Marengo said.\nCauses\nAccording to the researchers, the changing rainfall regime in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo may be due to natural climate variability but may also be related to global warming and growing urbanization that has occurred especially in the last 40 years, which has exacerbated the occurrence of urban heat islands.\nThe growth of urbanization has transformed the region\u2019s previously exposed soil and Atlantic Rainforest remnants into sealed concrete, cement and asphalt surfaces that absorb heat while retaining no moisture. The temperature rises during the day, and as the sun goes down, the accumulated heat rises into the atmosphere, the relative humidity falls, and water evaporates rapidly from the ground to form towering cumulonimbus clouds, Marengo explained.\nIn his view, heat islands and similar effects help explain the increase in extreme rainfall events that occurred in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo between 1933 and 2010.\nIn the last 20 years, these changes in the rainfall regime, in conjunction with the high-risk construction of buildings on hillsides and riverbanks, have led to an increase in hydrometeorological hazards, triggering disasters such as flash floods, river flooding and landslides, the authors note.\n\u201cAn extreme rainfall event isn\u2019t itself a natural disaster. So-called natural disasters actually result from a combination of factors ranging from climate and weather to urban, economic and social phenomena. In other words, they\u2019re also anthropogenic disasters that result from human action, not just climate,\u201d Marengo said.\nMost Brazilian states suffer from flooding, but it is worst in S\u00e3o Paulo, which accounts for 33.36% of cases, followed by Santa Catarina (11.25%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.06%), Paran\u00e1 (8.33%), Rio de Janeiro (7.28%) and Minas Gerais (5.96%).\nSome 170 river floods and flash floods occurred in the period 2014-18. Flash floods produced the most deaths and serious injuries, followed by landslides and mudslides.\n\u201cThe Southeast and South regions of Brazil are the worst affected by hydrometeorological disasters because of their population density,\u201d Marengo said.\n\u201cLandslides, for example, only kill people because they\u2019re forced to live in high-risk areas where no one should build a home. The streets only fill up with water because the rivers have been channelized and buried, and the city\u2019s surfaces are sealed with asphalt and concrete.\u201d\nSource: Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\nRelated\nBrazil\nIndonesia \u2013 at Least 3 Dead, 2 Missing After Floods and Landslides in 3 Provinces\nUSA \u2013  Neptune Flood Insurance Now Available in 42 States\n\nECMWF\nLatest Articles\nFollow Us\nCategories\nFlood News in Americas by Country\nEditor's Picks\nDepave \u2013 the Community-Based Approach to Storm Water Management\nUsing Drones for Flood Disaster Risk Reduction, Assessment and Recovery\nFlood Protection Options for Airports\nReport \u2013 Flood Losses in Europe to Increase Fivefold by 2050\nUN \u2013 1995 to 2015, Flood Disasters Affected 2.3 Billion and Killed 157,000\nDrowning World \u2013 Photographer Gideon Mendel\u2019s 8 Year Project\nFlood and High Water Marks\nG-Cans Project, Tokyo \u2013 Japan\u2019s $2.6 Billion Flood Tunnel\nCookies | Privacy |  Contacts\nNorth America\nSouth America\nEurope\nAsia\nAfrica\nOceania\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 FloodList \n",
    "Summarized_Document1": "March 2024 Monthly Weather Report\n\nUK Overview\nMarch was unsettled, wet, and dull. The month began colder than normal, with notable low temperatures in southern areas (e.g., -4.6\u00b0C in Benson, Oxfordshire on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd in southwest England, causing travel disruptions. Milder weather followed, with temperatures reaching up to 18.8\u00b0C in Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th. The month ended with unsettled weather, including rain and wind. The provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was milder with a mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C, while Scotland had 5.0\u00b0C. The UK recorded 127% of the long-term average rainfall for March, with England and Wales exceeding 150% of their averages. County Down in Northern Ireland had its third wettest March on record with 145.9mm of rain. The UK recorded just 95.2 hours of sunshine, 87% of the long-term average.\n\nWeather Impacts\nSnow in Ireland, southwest Midlands, and Bristol caused traffic disruptions. Persistent rain, especially in southern England, led to groundwater and surface water flooding. Heavy snow on the 1st and 2nd caused traffic incidents and road closures. The rest of the month saw regular rain, with significant flooding in Cornwall on the 25th/26th. The month ended with heavy showers and some settled weather over Easter.\n\nMonthly Extremes\n- Highest Maximum: 18.8\u00b0C on 20th at Charlwood, Surrey\n- Lowest Maximum: 1.2\u00b0C on 2nd at Pennerley, Shropshire\n- Highest Minimum: 11.6\u00b0C on 14th at Prestatyn, Clwyd\n- Lowest Minimum: -6.9\u00b0C on 26th at Altnaharra No 2, Sutherland\n- Most Rainfall: 94.4mm on 13th at Capel Curig No 3, Gwynedd\n- Most Sunshine: 11.5 hours on 30th at Kirkwall, Orkney and 31st at Bewcastle, Cumbria\n- Highest Gust: 70Kt (81mph) on 1st and 28th at Wight: Needles Old Battery, Isle of Wight\n- Greatest Snow Depth: 12cm on 1st at Lough Navar Forest, Fermanagh\n\nMonthly Climate Statistics\n- Mean Maximum Temperature: UK 10.0\u00b0C, England 11.1\u00b0C, Wales 10.0\u00b0C, Scotland 8.1\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 9.7\u00b0C\n- Mean Minimum Temperature: UK 3.5\u00b0C, England 4.4\u00b0C, Wales 4.0\u00b0C, Scotland 1.9\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 3.5\u00b0C\n- Mean Temperature: UK 6.7\u00b0C, England 7.8\u00b0C, Wales 7.0\u00b0C, Scotland 5.0\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 6.6\u00b0C\n- Rainfall: UK 107.8mm (127% of average), England 94.3mm (162%), Wales 158.2mm (153%), Scotland 112.7mm (90%), Northern Ireland 129.2mm (149%)\n- Sunshine: UK 95.2 hours (87% of average), England 93.4 hours (80%), Wales 86.8 hours (79%), Scotland 101.4 hours (104%), Northern Ireland 88.9 hours (88%)\n- Windspeed: UK 9.9 knots, England 8.9 knots, Wales 10.7 knots, Scotland 11.4 knots, Northern Ireland 9.9 knots\n\nMonthly Time-Series\n- Mean Temperature: 6.7\u00b0C (2024), 6.0\u00b0C (2015-2024), 5.7\u00b0C (1991-2020), 4.7\u00b0C (1961-1990)\n- Rainfall: 107.8mm (2024), 96.5mm (2015-2024), 85.1mm (1991-2020), 91.0mm (1961-1990)\n- Sunshine: 95.2 hours (2024), 113.6 hours (2015-2024), 109.2 hours (1991-2020), 100.0 hours (1961-1990)\n\nWeather Diary\nMarch was dominated by Atlantic low-pressure systems, with brief settled spells. The month started wet and windy, with significant rainfall and strong winds. High pressure over Scandinavia brought dry but cold conditions to northern England and Scotland from the 7th to the 11th. From the 13th to the 25th, a series of depressions brought more wind and rain. After the 25th, a north-south split was evident, with Scotland experiencing cold and showery weather, while the rest of the UK was milder but wet.\n\nNotes\nThe Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884. This report provides an overview of the weather conditions across the UK for March 2024, based on observations from the surface network of weather stations.

    "Summarized_Document2": "A study by Brazil\u2019s National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) reveals that extreme rainfall days in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have increased four-fold over seven decades. The research indicates a rise in consecutive dry days, suggesting that extreme rainfall events are now concentrated in shorter, more widely spaced periods. In February, S\u00e3o Paulo experienced significant flooding, with 114 millimeters (mm) of rain falling in a single 24-hour period, the second highest for the month since 1943. The study, supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and reported in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, shows that days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) have increased from practically none in the 1950s to between two and five times per year in the last decade. Researchers from INMET, INPE, and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo also contributed to the study. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo, a senior researcher at CEMADEN, noted that intense rainstorms with 80 mm to 100 mm of rain are becoming more frequent. Data from INMET\u2019s weather stations at IAG-USP and Santana Lookout showed a four-fold increase in days with rainfall exceeding 100 mm between 2000 and 2018 compared to the 1940s or 1960s. The study also found an increase in total rainfall, the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, and consecutive dry days from 1931 to 2017. The researchers suggest that these changes may be due to natural climate variability, global warming, and urbanization, which has created urban heat islands. These changes, combined with high-risk construction on hillsides and riverbanks, have increased hydrometeorological hazards, leading to more flash floods, river flooding, and landslides. S\u00e3o Paulo accounts for 33.36% of flooding cases in Brazil, followed by Santa Catarina (11.25%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.06%), Paran\u00e1 (8.33%), Rio de Janeiro (7.28%), and Minas Gerais (5.96%). Between 2014 and 2018, 170 river floods and flash floods occurred, with flash floods causing the most deaths and injuries. The Southeast and South regions of Brazil are the worst affected by hydrometeorological disasters due to their population density.",

    "Document2": "The Maldives is racing to create new land. Why are so many people concerned?\nBy Jesse Chase-Lubitz\nPhotography by Neeta Satam for Nature\n24 April 2024\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSun, sand and sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those are the three ingredients for tourism in the Maldives, Mohamed Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father told him. For more than a decade, Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family owned a successful local hotel in Addu, the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 southernmost atoll. But nearly 9\u00a0months ago, the government took away the sea.\nA state-sponsored project had pulled up sediment from offshore areas and used it to extend the beach in front of the hotel by 130\u00a0metres\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 too far to walk for most tourists who want easy access to the ocean. Now all Shaiz sees from his hotel is a human-made desert and a slew of cancelled reservations.\nThe view in front of Mohamed Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel on Addu Atoll.\nThe Maldives is an 820-kilometre-long chain of nearly 1,200 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. The nation has become one of the most popular luxury tourism destinations in the world because of its Instagrammable beaches and its advertising slogan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe sunny side of life\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But the Maldives is also one of the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. With 80% of its land less than one metre above sea level, some scientists predict that the islands could be completely submerged by 2100.\nIn an effort to keep the country above water and thriving, the government is adopting a strategy used by many nations around the globe: land reclamation. The sandy stretch in front of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel is some of the newest land on the planet, dug up from the bottom of the ocean, sucked through pipes and piled along the coast to make more space.\nMaldivian government officials say that the land is necessary to make room for economic development, especially as sea levels rise.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will be a doorstep, a job destination and an income-generating destination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said President Mohamed Muizzu at the inauguration of a new land-reclamation project last December.\nCritics are unconvinced, and say that the country has enough space to thrive. One swathe of land on a neighbouring island near Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel was reclaimed in 2016. It remains undeveloped today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCall me in five years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shaiz says, gesturing to the newly created desert in front of his hotel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis land will be the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMohamed Shaiz and his family own a hotel on Addu Atoll.\nMohamed Shaiz and his family own a hotel on Addu Atoll.\nIn addition to the disputed economics, there is serious concern about the environmental damage that land reclamation can cause. Studies in the Maldives and at other sites around the world have shown that it can harm corals and seagrass, damage natural barriers, such as sand bars, mangroves and estuaries, and destroy marine habitats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAtolls are extremely vulnerable ecosystems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Bregje van Wesenbeeck, the scientific director of Deltares, a Dutch research institute for water management in Delft. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce you start to interfere with them, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sort of failing them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll.\nThe island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll.\nDutch planners are often considered the founders of land reclamation, with a history of water engineering going back some 800\u00a0years. Over the centuries, land-forming projects have shaped some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major cities, including Singapore, London, New York and Miami. In recent decades, most of the reclaimed land has been in East Asia. In China, Shanghai has reclaimed 350\u00a0square kilometres \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than three times the size of Paris\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 over the past few decades. Colombo has added 100\u00a0km2 in just 4\u00a0years, and 65\u00a0km2 of Mumbai is reclaimed. A study on twenty-first-century coastal-land reclamation found that of 135 large coastal cities with populations of more than one\u00a0million people, 75%\u00a0had reclaimed land1.\nWith projects stretching back to 1997, the Maldives is a veteran of large-scale land reclamation. Then-minister of state for environment Abdulla Naseer said in 2018 that there are an estimated 50\u00a0islands with reclaimed land in the country, although many specialists say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a conservative estimate.\nSource: Maldives Land and Survey Authority\nSource: Maldives Land and Survey Authority\nLand scarcity is a key factor driving reclamation projects. Although the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territory covers 90,000\u00a0km2, more than 99% of it is ocean. Around half a million people live on a total land area of just 300\u00a0km2, and the country welcomes around 1.3\u00a0million tourists each year, who contribute 80% of its gross domestic product. The capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9, is one of the most densely populated parts of the planet.

When the government decides to reclaim land, it takes sand from the lagoons using boats outfitted with suction pipes, which collect sand and coral debris from the ocean floor like giant vacuum cleaners. The boat then deposits the material in a different spot, either inside or outside the atoll, to form new land. Sometimes reclamation projects fill in the entire lagoon.\nHeaps of sand and debris are piled up next to Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel and behind the new patch of reclaimed land.\nHeaps of sand and debris are piled up next to Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel and behind the new patch of reclaimed land.\nAddu Atoll, the site of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, is about two hours south of Mal\u00c3\u00a9 by aeroplane. Its rich coral reefs support more than 1,200\u00a0species of fish\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the factors that led the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO to include the atoll in its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2020.\nSome of the islands are so narrow that you can almost always see water on both sides while standing in the centre. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a largely quiet and rural place that feels forgotten. Yet construction marches on.\nThe Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure announced the Addu Development Project in 2021, aiming to reclaim parts of the atoll and develop a road connection between existing islands. One of the ministry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s justifications is that it will provide extra housing. In the Maldives, land for houses is given away to eligible individuals and families. Addu City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, Ali Nizar, says that there have been more than 5,000\u00a0requests for housing since he entered office in 2021. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no other way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nA reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts.\nA reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts.\nBecause Addu has one of the few international airports in the country, the hope is also that the extra land will attract international investment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this huge expansion project, the transformational development of Addu City has commenced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said former president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih after inaugurating the project in June 2023.\nThe project has been controversial from the start. When it was announced, Ibrahim Mohamed was sitting at his desk at the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Mal\u00c3\u00a9. He instantly had concerns about how the project would affect Addu. Mohamed grew up in Addu in the 1970s, taking walks through the massive seagrass beds near his home. He remembers watching stingrays surf the waves, and marvelling at fiddler crabs along the shore.\nMohamed led the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for land-reclamation projects. When the Addu proposal landed on his desk, he contracted an environmental consulting group called Water Solutions, headquarted in Mal\u00c3\u00a9, to do the review.\nThe environmental impact report, published in February 2022, found that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe proposed reclamation is well received by the community\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh interest to implement the project based on the potential economic benefits\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But it also concluded that \u00e2\u0080\u009clong-term irreversible negative impacts will be generated from the project\u00e2\u0080\u009d for both the environment and the community, including by destroying coral reefs and seagrass meadows and harming the fishing and tourism industries.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was sufficient enough for the EPA to reject the project,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mohamed says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In May 2022, he quit his job after 10\u00a0years at the agency.\nAfter the report came out, the EPA pushed for changes, such as a smaller area from which the project would source sand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe tried to change the scope because we are here to protect the environment and at the same time, help development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director-general, Ibrahim Naeem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDevelopment has to go hand in hand with environment. It should not destroy the environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nOnce the changes were made to the proposed project, Water Solutions produced a second report to assess the environmental impacts at the end of September 2022. It found that the altered project, with increased mitigation and monitoring in place, would still have irreversible negative impacts\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 ranging from moderate to major\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 on marine plants and animals, protected and sensitive areas, tourism, fisheries and recreational activities.\nThe assessment calculated that the cost of the damage to coral reefs alone would be between US$340\u00a0million and $851\u00a0million.\nThe September 2022 report does not offer explicit recommendations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur role is to share the information. We just wanted to present the facts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Ahmed Jameel, managing director of Water Solutions and one of the authors of the report. However, he adds, the assessment was not vague in its conclusions. The findings showed clearly that the project \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould have an overall negative impact\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he says.\nWhen asked about the concerns raised in the second report, Naeem says that the findings, combined with insights he received from EPA staff members who conducted anonymous reviews of the EIA, indicated that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cenough justification in the report to approve it in terms of social benefit\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny development projects in this type of environment, especially in the marine area, will have an impact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you do reclamation properly, and if you do it wisely, I think impacts can be minimized\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nIbrahim Mohamed previously worked for the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency.\nIbrahim Mohamed previously worked for the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe construction company Van Oord is performing the reclamation work for the Addu Atoll project.\nThe construction company Van Oord is performing the reclamation work for the Addu Atoll project.\nThe Dutch company responsible for doing the construction on the project, Van Oord, told Nature that environmental management for the project is overseen by the EPA and that it is working with the agency and local specialists to minimize the environmental impacts. Van Oord said it prepared a comprehensive environmental management plan \u00e2\u0080\u009cbased on the mitigation measures mandated in the EIA and in compliance with international guidelines\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As part of its efforts, the company relocated coral and seagrass, and added silt screens to limit how much sediment would flow beyond the reclamation zone and affect other areas.\nVan Oord, which is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told Nature that \u00e2\u0080\u009call the predicted impacts have been effectively managed by implementing a series of mitigation measures\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nA new house on Hulhumeedhoo island, to the northeast of Addu City, remains unfinished and unoccupied.\nA new house on Hulhumeedhoo island, to the northeast of Addu City, remains unfinished and unoccupied.\nIn October 2022, the EPA approved the project. But critics say the environmental costs of the reclamation are too high.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think their efforts are not worth the amount of destruction and the irreversible damage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mohamed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can never be compensated properly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nToday, the land in front of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel is the result of that decision. Yet if you speak to people on Addu, many say that land is not what they need right now; they need jobs. Much of Addu is filled with empty, unfinished homes because individuals don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the income or resources to build houses on their free land.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty per cent [of our land] is abandoned or empty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Addu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former deputy mayor, Abdullah Thoyyib, who served the city before this reclamation project took place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need economic benefits and job opportunities, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nReefs at risk\nReclamation projects in the Maldives can fill the water with sediment, threatening coral reefs.\nReclamation projects in the Maldives can fill the water with sediment, threatening coral reefs.\nSitting in a resort in Addu City, Nisal Musthag places a map of Addu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main diving spots on the table. Musthag leads diving trips for one of the two active resorts in the atoll, and he has seen some of the damage that follows reclamation projects. He points at one of the four channels between the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagoon and the ocean. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is like a cemetery now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nMusthag does three to four dives a day, six days a week. Since the most-recent reclamation, there are at least five sites he no longer takes guests to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are people who come back every year to dive, and this year they were like, hey, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNisal Musthag leads diving trips in Addu, but has stopped taking tourists to spots where coral was damaged by reclamation projects.\nThe impacts of reclamation on coral health are one of researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 main concerns. Some reefs die when sediment is dumped on them to create new land. But even corals that escape direct damage can be harmed because the construction work creates clouds of sediment that spread out and settle on more distant reefs. Robbed of light and nutrients, these corals can struggle to survive. The damage to reefs not only harms the ecosystem but can also leave the islands vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise, say scientists.\nTo reduce damage to corals during the work at Addu, the EIA required that at least 10% of existing corals be relocated outside the reclamation footprints. Van Oord says it has moved 73,000\u00a0corals to 9\u00a0recipient sites identified in conjunction with the EPA. The firm says that it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly surpassed the EIA requirement\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nSaleem Rasheed is one of several local divers who helped to relocate the corals. He has been monitoring them for the past year. One species, blue coral (Heliopora coerulea), which was moved from the outside of the atoll to the inside, died completely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe moved 80\u00a0colonies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Rasheed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey survived one week and died entirely after six months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAli Nizar, Addu City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, supports the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reclamation projects.\nFathimath Saaira, social-justice advocate in Addu. \nFathimath Saaira, social-justice advocate in Addu. \nFathimath Saaira is a social-justice advocate in Addu who opposes the reclamation there.\nBut the rest of the species have shown resilience. Three months after relocation, they were struggling, but now, Rasheed says, they are alive and well.\nResearchers have found that coral relocation can work if colonies are moved to areas with similar conditions that are protected from waves. A 2017 study in Hawaii, for example, showed that relocated corals were thriving a decade after they were moved2. One study on coral restoration and relocation in the Maldives measured the survival rate of 242\u00a0coral fragments 12\u00a0months after they had been moved3. The authors found a 70% survival rate, which they concluded was a promising result. \nA solitary mangrove tree grows near newly reclaimed land in northeast Addu.\nA grey heron joins others on a new sea wall built in Addu.\nBut coral health is only one concern for researchers studying the effects of reclamation. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coastal ecosystems can also be in harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, say scientists.\nWater Solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 second report about the Addu project, for example, projected that the reclamation process would bury about 98\u00a0hectares of seagrass meadow in the atoll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagoon, at an estimated economic cost of more than $3.7\u00a0million a year.\nCoral debris makes up much of the reclaimed land.\nCoral debris makes up much of the reclaimed land.\nNot far from Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, a sea wall stretches towards the horizon, protecting a new swathe of land made of sand and coral debris. Coastal protection efforts such as the sea wall\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the changes wrought by reclamation\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 could have long-lasting effects on the processes that keep the islands from eroding, say researchers.\nLike other atolls, the Maldivian islands evolve with the seasons, with monsoons moving sand around them. Between December and February, the winds transport sand from the northeast to the southwest. Between June and August, the pattern reverses.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a natural island, you will see seasonally the sand shifting with the waves and the currents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mohamed. But reclamation can impede this process, he adds, by taking sand and coral debris from some locations through dredging\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 leaving a deficit in its wake\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and depositing it where natural flows wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Some projects add another complication by building hard barriers, such as sea walls, to protect the land, because they can stop the natural flow of sediments.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEcosystems can adapt if we allow them to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says van Wesenbeeck at Deltares. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy interfering, you will kill the whole system in the end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNot only does this change how the island naturally maintains itself, but it can also draw development to places that are at a high risk of a storm surge or erosion, say some researchers.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIslands can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t occur anywhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Virginie Duvat, a coastal geographer at La Rochelle University in France, who has studied the effects of land reclamation in the Maldives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you put an island where there was naturally no island, you create vulnerable land and you will necessarily have to build strong engineered structures, breakwaters and sea walls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says.\nA reclamation projection near Mal\u00c3\u00a9.\nThilafushi is an industrial island near Mal\u00c3\u00a9 that hosts one of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large rubbish dumps. New land is extending the island westward.\nIn a 2019 study4, Duvat and Alexandre Magnan, a geographer at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Sciences Po in Paris, assessed the scale of coastal changes that humans had made to 107 inhabited islands in the Maldives between 2004\u00e2\u0080\u009306 and 2014\u00e2\u0080\u009316. On almost half the islands, the researchers found significant degradation in the reefs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abilities to weaken waves and provide natural sources of sediments. One-fifth of the islands had almost entirely or entirely \u00e2\u0080\u009clost their natural capacity to respond and adjust to ocean climate-related pressures\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the researchers say.\nSource: Ref. 4\nSource: Ref. 4\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt means that a decision you have taken one day to rely on reclaimed land will necessarily cause you to invest more money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Duvat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are locked into the engineered path for decades and decades and potentially the rest of the century.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you build a levee, people will think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re safe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says van Wesenbeeck. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut is it wise to destroy environmental assets to create investment in an area that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the most vulnerable in the world for climate change?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe city of hope\nA new housing development in Hulhumal\u00c3\u00a9. \nA new housing development in Hulhumal\u00c3\u00a9. \nSome 550\u00a0km to the north of Addu, the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9, sits like an overpopulated postage stamp in the middle of the ocean.\nMal\u00c3\u00a9 is tiny\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 less than 2\u00a0km across at its widest point\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 but more than 200,000\u00a0people live on the island.

    "Summarized_Document2": "\u201cSun, sand and sea.\u201d Those are the three ingredients for tourism in the Maldives, Mohamed Shaiz\u2019s father told him. For more than a decade, Shaiz\u2019s family owned a successful local hotel in Addu, the Maldives\u2019 southernmost atoll. But nearly 9 months ago, the government took away the sea. A state-sponsored project had pulled up sediment from offshore areas and used it to extend the beach in front of the hotel by 130 metres \u2014 too far to walk for most tourists who want easy access to the ocean. Now all Shaiz sees from his hotel is a human-made desert and a slew of cancelled reservations. The Maldives is an 820-kilometre-long chain of nearly 1,200 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. The nation has become one of the most popular luxury tourism destinations in the world because of its Instagrammable beaches and its advertising slogan: \u201cthe sunny side of life\u201d. But the Maldives is also one of the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. With 80% of its land less than one metre above sea level, some scientists predict that the islands could be completely submerged by 2100. In an effort to keep the country above water and thriving, the government is adopting a strategy used by many nations around the globe: land reclamation. The sandy stretch in front of Shaiz\u2019s hotel is some of the newest land on the planet, dug up from the bottom of the ocean, sucked through pipes and piled along the coast to make more space. Maldivian government officials say that the land is necessary to make room for economic development, especially as sea levels rise. Critics are unconvinced, and say that the country has enough space to thrive. One swathe of land on a neighbouring island near Shaiz\u2019s hotel was reclaimed in 2016. It remains undeveloped today. In addition to the disputed economics, there is serious concern about the environmental damage that land reclamation can cause. Studies in the Maldives and at other sites around the world have shown that it can harm corals and seagrass, damage natural barriers, such as sand bars, mangroves and estuaries, and destroy marine habitats. The island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00e9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll. Dutch planners are often considered the founders of land reclamation, with a history of water engineering going back some 800 years. Over the centuries, land-forming projects have shaped some of the world\u2019s major cities, including Singapore, London, New York and Miami. In recent decades, most of the reclaimed land has been in East Asia. In China, Shanghai has reclaimed 350 square kilometres \u2014 more than three times the size of Paris \u2014 over the past few decades. Colombo has added 100 km2 in just 4 years, and 65 km2 of Mumbai is reclaimed. A study on twenty-first-century coastal-land reclamation found that of 135 large coastal cities with populations of more than one million people, 75% had reclaimed land. With projects stretching back to 1997, the Maldives is a veteran of large-scale land reclamation. Then-minister of state for environment Abdulla Naseer said in 2018 that there are an estimated 50 islands with reclaimed land in the country, although many specialists say that\u2019s a conservative estimate. Land scarcity is a key factor driving reclamation projects. Although the nation\u2019s territory covers 90,000 km2, more than 99% of it is ocean. Around half a million people live on a total land area of just 300 km2, and the country welcomes around 1.3 million tourists each year, who contribute 80% of its gross domestic product. The capital, Mal\u00e9, is one of the most densely populated parts of the planet. It\u2019s possible to walk across the entire island in 20 minutes. The Maldives\u2019 1,200 islands are all atolls \u2014 rings of coral reef that surround lagoons. When the government decides to reclaim land, it takes sand from the lagoons using boats outfitted with suction pipes, which collect sand and coral debris from the ocean floor like giant vacuum cleaners. The boat then deposits the material in a different spot, either inside or outside the atoll, to form new land. Sometimes reclamation projects fill in the entire lagoon. Addu Atoll, the site of Shaiz\u2019s hotel, is about two hours south of Mal\u00e9 by aeroplane. Its rich coral reefs support more than 1,200 species of fish \u2014 one of the factors that led the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO to include the atoll in its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2020. Some of the islands are so narrow that you can almost always see water on both sides while standing in the centre. It\u2019s a largely quiet and rural place that feels forgotten. Yet construction marches on. The Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure announced the Addu Development Project in 2021, aiming to reclaim parts of the atoll and develop a road connection between existing islands. One of the ministry\u2019s justifications is that it will provide extra housing. In the Maldives, land for houses is given away to eligible individuals and families. Addu City\u2019s mayor, Ali Nizar, says that there have been more than 5,000 requests for housing since he entered office in 2021. A reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts. Because Addu has one of the few international airports in the country, the hope is also that the extra land will attract international investment. The project has been controversial from the start. When it was announced, Ibrahim Mohamed was sitting at his desk at the Maldives\u2019 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Mal\u00e9. He instantly had concerns about how the project would affect Addu. Mohamed grew up in Addu in the 1970s, taking walks through the massive seagrass beds near his home. He remembers watching stingrays surf the waves, and marvelling at fiddler crabs along the shore. Mohamed led the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for land-reclamation projects. When the Addu proposal landed on his desk, he contracted an environmental consulting group called Water Solutions, headquarted in Mal\u00e9, to do the review. The environmental impact report, published in February 2022, found that \u201cthe proposed reclamation is well received by the community\u201d and that there was \u201chigh interest to implement the project based on the potential economic benefits\u201d. But it also concluded that \u201clong-term irreversible negative impacts will be generated from the project\u201d for both the environment and the community, including by destroying coral reefs and seagrass meadows and harming the fishing and tourism industries. \u201cIt was sufficient enough for the EPA to reject the project,\u201d Mohamed says. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t.\u201d In May 2022, he quit his job after 10 years at the agency. After the report came out, the EPA pushed for changes, such as a smaller area from which the project would source sand. \u201cWe tried to change the scope because we are here to protect the environment and at the same time, help development,\u201d says the agency\u2019s director-general, Ibrahim Naeem. \u201cDevelopment has to go hand in hand with environment. It should not destroy the environment,\u201d he says. Once the changes were made to the proposed project, Water Solutions produced a second report to assess the environmental impacts at the end of September 2022. It found that the altered project, with increased mitigation and monitoring in place, would still have irreversible negative impacts \u2014 ranging from moderate to major \u2014 on marine plants and animals, protected and sensitive areas, tourism, fisheries and recreational activities. The assessment calculated that the cost of the damage to coral reefs alone would be between US$340 million and $851 million. The September 2022 report does not offer explicit recommendations. \u201cOur role is to share the information. We just wanted to present the facts,\u201d says Ahmed Jameel, managing director of Water Solutions and one of the authors of the report. However, he adds, the assessment was not vague in its conclusions. The findings showed clearly that the project \u201cwould have an overall negative impact\u201d, he says. When asked about the concerns raised in the second report, Naeem says that the findings, combined with insights he received from EPA staff members who conducted anonymous reviews of the EIA, indicated that there was \u201cenough justification in the report to approve it in terms of social benefit\u201d. \u201cAny development projects in this type of environment, especially in the marine area, will have an impact,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cif you do reclamation properly, and if you do it wisely, I think impacts can be minimized\u201d. The Dutch company responsible for doing the construction on the project, Van Oord, told Nature that environmental management for the project is overseen by the EPA and that it is working with the agency and local specialists to minimize the environmental impacts. Van Oord said it prepared a comprehensive environmental management plan \u201cbased on the mitigation measures mandated in the EIA and in compliance with international guidelines\u201d. As part of its efforts, the company relocated coral and seagrass, and added silt screens to limit how much sediment would flow beyond the reclamation zone and affect other areas. Van Oord, which is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told Nature that \u201call the predicted impacts have been effectively managed by implementing a series of mitigation measures\u201d. In October 2022, the EPA approved the project. But critics say the environmental costs of the reclamation are too high. \u201cI think their efforts are not worth the amount of destruction and the irreversible damage,\u201d says Mohamed. \u201cIt can never be compensated properly.\u201d Today, the land in front of Shaiz\u2019s hotel is the result of that decision. Yet if you speak to people on Addu, many say that land is not what they need right now; they need jobs. Much of Addu is filled with empty, unfinished homes because individuals don\u2019t have the income or resources to build houses on their free land. \u201cFifty per cent [of our land] is abandoned or empty,\u201d says Addu\u2019s former deputy mayor, Abdullah Thoyyib, who served the city before this reclamation project took place. \u201cWe need economic benefits and job opportunities, but that\u2019s not happening.\u201d Sitting in a resort in Addu City, Nisal Musthag places a map of Addu\u2019s main diving spots on the table. Musthag leads diving trips for one of the two active resorts in the atoll, and he has seen some of the damage that follows reclamation projects. He points at one of the four channels between the island\u2019s lagoon and the ocean. \u201cThis is like a cemetery now,\u201d he says. Musthag does three to four dives a day, six days a week. Since the most-recent reclamation, there are at least five sites he no longer takes guests to. \u201cThere are people who come back every year to dive, and this year they were like, hey, what\u2019s happening?\u201d The impacts of reclamation on coral health are one of researchers\u2019 main concerns. Some reefs die when sediment is dumped on them to create new land. But even corals that escape direct damage can be harmed because the construction work creates clouds of sediment that spread out and settle on more distant reefs. Robbed of light and nutrients, these corals can struggle to survive. The damage to reefs not only harms the ecosystem but can also leave the islands vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise, say scientists. To reduce damage to corals during the work at Addu, the EIA required that at least 10% of existing corals be relocated outside the reclamation footprints. Van Oord says it has moved 73,000 corals to 9 recipient sites identified in conjunction with the EPA. The firm says that it \u201ccertainly surpassed the EIA requirement\u201d. Saleem Rasheed is one of several local divers who helped to relocate the corals. He has been monitoring them for the past year. One species, blue coral (Heliopora coerulea), which was moved from the outside of the atoll to the inside, died completely. \u201cWe moved 80 colonies,\u201d says Rasheed. \u201cThey survived one week and died entirely after six months.\u201d But the rest of the species have shown resilience. Three months after relocation, they were struggling, but now, Rasheed says, they are alive and well. Researchers have found that coral relocation can work if colonies are moved to areas with similar conditions that are protected from waves. A 2017 study in Hawaii, for example, showed that relocated corals were thriving a decade after they were moved. One study on coral restoration and relocation in the Maldives measured the survival rate of 242 coral fragments 12 months after they had been moved. The authors found a 70% survival rate, which they concluded was a promising result. But coral health is only one concern for researchers studying the effects of reclamation. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coastal ecosystems can also be in harm\u2019s way, say scientists. Water Solutions\u2019 second report about the Addu project, for example, projected that the reclamation process would bury about 98 hectares of seagrass meadow in the atoll\u2019s lagoon, at an estimated economic cost of more than $3.7 million a year. Not far from Shaiz\u2019s hotel, a sea wall stretches towards the horizon, protecting a new swathe of land made of sand and coral debris. Coastal protection efforts such as the sea wall \u2014 and the changes wrought by reclamation \u2014 could have long-lasting effects on the processes that keep the islands from eroding, say researchers. Like other atolls, the Maldivian islands evolve with the seasons, with monsoons moving sand around them. Between December and February, the winds transport sand from the northeast to the southwest. Between June and August, the pattern reverses. \u201cIn a natural island, you will see seasonally the sand shifting with the waves and the currents,\u201d says Mohamed. But reclamation can impede this process, he adds, by taking sand and coral debris from some locations through dredging \u2014 leaving a deficit in its wake \u2014 and depositing it where natural flows wouldn\u2019t. Some projects add another complication by building hard barriers, such as sea walls, to protect the land, because they can stop the natural flow of sediments. \u201cEcosystems can adapt if we allow them to,\u201d says van Wesenbeeck at Deltares. \u201cBy interfering, you will kill the whole system in the end.\u201d Not only does this change how the island naturally maintains itself, but it can also draw development to places that are at a high risk of a storm surge or erosion, say some researchers. \u201cIslands can\u2019t occur anywhere,\u201d says Virginie Duvat, a coastal geographer at La Rochelle University in France, who has studied the effects of land reclamation in the Maldives. \u201cIf you put an island where there was naturally no island, you create vulnerable land and you will necessarily have to build strong engineered structures, breakwaters and sea walls,\u201d she says. In a 2019 study, Duvat and Alexandre Magnan, a geographer at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations \u2014 Sciences Po in Paris, assessed the scale of coastal changes that humans had made to 107 inhabited islands in the Maldives between 2004\u201306 and 2014\u201316. On almost half the islands, the researchers found significant degradation in the reefs\u2019 abilities to weaken waves and provide natural sources of sediments. One-fifth of the islands had almost entirely or entirely \u201clost their natural capacity to respond and adjust to ocean climate-related pressures\u201d, the researchers say. \u201cIt means that a decision you have taken one day to rely on reclaimed land will necessarily cause you to invest more money,\u201d says Duvat. \u201cYou are locked into the engineered path for decades and decades and potentially the rest of the century.\u201d \u201cIf you build a levee, people will think they\u2019re safe,\u201d says van Wesenbeeck. \u201cBut is it wise to destroy environmental assets to create investment in an area that\u2019s one of the most vulnerable in the world for climate change?\u201d Some 550 km to the north of Addu, the capital, Mal\u00e9, sits like an overpopulated postage stamp in the middle of the ocean. Mal\u00e9 is tiny \u2014 less than 2 km across at its widest point \u2014 but more than 200,000 people live on the island. To relieve population pressures, the government decided in the late 1990s to start reclaiming a massive atoll next to Mal\u00e9, called Hulhumal\u00e9. Hulhumal\u00e9 has become known as \u2018the city of hope\u2019 \u2014 a place that not only has room but is also protected from sea-level rise. Architects designed it with sea-level-rise scenarios until 2100 in mind. The outer edges are 2 metres above sea level, more than twice the height of Mal\u00e9. Hulhulmal\u00e9 is regarded by specialists mainly as a worthwhile success for land reclamation, but critics have raised many questions about three newer projects on the western side of Mal\u00e9, all of which are being built using sand from the nearby lagoon. In 2021, Humay Abdulghafoor, a Mal\u00e9-based veteran fighter against land reclamation, sued three institutional bodies of the government on the grounds that they violated an environmental-protection law. She said that a new reclamation project risked causing serious environmental, economic and cultural damage to the local community by undermining \u201cthe economic and social benefits flowing from the natural environment and biodiversity richness of the Maldives\u201d, according to her legal case. The case has been ongoing for years, but on 14 February, it had its first breakthrough. The country\u2019s High Court decided to pause a dredging project near Mal\u00e9. However, the next day, the Supreme Court said that this pause would cause significant financial losses and overturned the decision. Mauroof Jameel, one of five architects chosen to build Hulhumal\u00e9, also has concerns about the latest projects. Jameel, who is based in Mal\u00e9, says that it made sense to reclaim land at Hulhumal\u00e9 to address congestion and help to build up the economy, but he is hesitant about how fast reclamation projects are now taking place. No one knows what the long-term impacts will be, he says. In many parts of the world, including the Maldives, land reclamation can be beneficial, say scientists. \u201cIn my opinion, it can be a positive thing around Mal\u00e9,\u201d says Duvat, because of population pressures there. But she doesn\u2019t see as much justification in more rural, distant atolls. \u201cIn this case, I cannot see the benefits.\u201d Officials with the Maldivian government acknowledge that land reclamation can cause harm. But there is no indication that the process is slowing down. Just 3 months after Muizzu was inaugurated as president last November, he announced the biggest reclamation project the nation has ever seen \u2014another endeavour to reclaim land near Mal\u00e9 on top of those already in the works. \u201cThe brand-new model city will revolutionize the country\u2019s urban landscape, addressing housing challenges in the greater Mal\u00e9 region by providing 65,000 housing units,\u201d he said in February at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. But many former officials urge caution. \u201cHow we create land, and the extent to which we do it, is excessive,\u201d says Mohamed Aslam, the minister of planning, housing and infrastructure for the previous administration, the agency responsible for land-reclamation projects. He says that land is often reclaimed as an easy way to keep the public happy, to show them that the government is doing something. \u201cThe easy part is building the land,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly after that does the hard part begin.\u201d",

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

Additionally, the bulletin also includes highlights regarding the boreal summer (June-July-August). Most of the reported findings are based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature highlights:\u00a0\n  \n\nGlobal Temperatures\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally (together with August 2023), with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August.\u202f\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was 1.51\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level and is the 13th month in a 14-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. *\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record for any 12-month period, at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. These values are identical to those recorded for the previous two 12-month periods, ending in June and July 2024.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.23\u00b0C warmer than the same period in 2023. The average anomaly for the remaining months of this year would need to drop by at least 0.30\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. This has never happened in the entire ERA5 dataset, making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record.\u00a0\n*Datasets other than ERA5 may not confirm the 13 months above 1.5\u00b0C highlighted here, due to the relatively small margins above 1.5\u00b0C of ERA5 global temperatures for July and August 2023 and May, June, and August 2024 and differences among the various datasets.\u00a0\nEurope and other regions\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for August 2024 was 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August, making the month the second warmest August on record for Europe after August 2022, which was 1.73\u00b0C above average.\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean temperatures were most above average over southern and eastern Europe, but below average over northwestern parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway.\u00a0\u00a0\nOutside Europe, temperatures were most above average over eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\nTemperatures were below average over far eastern Russia and Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan and the Sahel.\u00a0\nSea surface temperature\u00a0\nThe average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest value on record for the month, and only 0.07\u00b0C below August 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe equatorial Pacific had below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs across the oceans remained unusually high over many regions.\u00a0\nAccording to Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): \"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0\nMonthly year-to-date global surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for the ten warmest years on record. 2024 is shown with a red line, 2023 with a yellow line, and all other years with grey lines. Each data point shows the average anomaly from January to the corresponding month. E.g. the value for August 2024 corresponds to the average anomaly from January to August 2024. Data source: ERA5.

The Indian subcontinent was hit by monsoon rains and Cyclone Asna. Heavy rainfall led to flooding in Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Japan was hit by Typhoon Shanshan.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt was drier than average in Mexico and southern North America, regions of Russia, across China, and most of South America and Southern Africa, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia and Brazil.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Sea Ice highlights \n  \n\n\n          2024 Boreal Summer Seasonal Highlights \n  \n\n\nDOWNLOAD IMAGE\u00a0|\u00a0DOWNLOAD DATA\u00a0|\u00a0INTERACTIVE IMAGE\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for these three months, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C).\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for summer (June-August) 2024 was the highest on record for the season at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, exceeding the previous record from 2022 (1.34\u00b0C).\u00a0\u00a0\nSummer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe.\u00a0\u00a0\nMost of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe saw drier-than-average conditions throughout the season, in some cases associated to drought.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n- End -\n\n          More Information\n  \n\nMore information about climate variables in May and climate updates of previous months as well as high-resolution graphics can be downloaded here.\u00a0\nAnswers to frequently asked questions regarding temperature monitoring can be found here.\u00a0\nTemperature monitoring FAQs\nFollow near-real-time data for the globe on Climate Pulse here.\u00a0\nMore on trends and projections on Climate Atlas here.\u00a0\nInformation about the C3S data set and how it is compiled:\u00a0\nTemperature and hydrological maps and data are from ECMWF Copernicus Climate Change Service\u2019s ERA5 and ERA5-Land (surface soil moisture) datasets.\u00a0\nThe findings about global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) presented here are based on SST data from ERA5 averaged over the 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N domain. Note that ERA5 SSTs are estimates of the ocean temperature at about 10m depth (known as foundation temperature). The results may differ from other SST products providing temperature estimates at different depths, such as 20cm depth for NOAA\u2019s OISST.\u00a0\nSea ice maps and data are from a combination of information from ERA5, as well as from the EUMETSAT OSI SAF Sea Ice Index v2.2.\u00a0\nRegional area averages quoted here are the following longitude/latitude bounds:\u00a0\nGlobe, 180W-180E, 90S-90N, over land and ocean surfaces.\u00a0\nEurope, 25W-40E, 34N-72N, over land surfaces only.\u00a0\u00a0\nAbout the Data and Analysis\nInformation on national records and impacts:\u00a0\nInformation on national records and impacts are based on national and regional reports. For details see the respective temperature and hydrological C3S climate bulletin for the month.\u00a0\nC3S has followed the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to use the most recent 30-year period for calculating climatological averages and changed to the reference period of 1991-2020 for its C3S Climate Bulletins covering January 2021 onward. Figures and graphics for both the new and previous period (1981-2010) are provided for transparency.\u00a0\nMore information on the reference period\n\n          About Copernicus and ECMWF \n  \n\nCopernicus is a component of the European Union\u2019s space programme, with funding by the EU, and is its flagship Earth observation programme, which operates through six thematic services: Atmosphere, Marine, Land, Climate Change, Security and Emergency. It delivers freely accessible operational data and services providing users with reliable and up-to-date information related to our planet and its environment. The programme is coordinated and managed by the European Commission and implemented in partnership with the Member States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), EU Agencies and Mercator Oc\u00e9an, amongst others.\u202f\u00a0\nECMWF operates two services from the EU\u2019s Copernicus Earth observation programme: the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). They also contribute to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), which is implemented by the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC). The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by 35 states. It is both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing and disseminating numerical weather predictions to its Member States. This data is fully available to the national meteorological services in the Member States. The supercomputer facility (and associated data archive) at ECMWF is one of the largest of its type in Europe and Member States can use 25% of its capacity for their own purposes.\u202f\u00a0\nECMWF has expanded its location across its Member States for some activities.

The equatorial Pacific showed below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs remained unusually high in many regions.Hydrologically, August 2024 was drier than average over most of continental Europe, including southern UK and Ireland, the Alps, the Balkans, northwest Russia, and eastern Fennoscandia, with droughts and wildfires in the south and east. Conversely, Iceland, northern UK and Ireland, much of Fennoscandia, the northern seaboard of continental Europe, and western Russia and T\u00fcrkiye experienced above-average precipitation, leading to floods and damage in some areas. Outside Europe, eastern North America, central Russia, eastern China, and eastern Australia were wetter than average, while Mexico, southern North America, regions of Russia, China, most of South America, and Southern Africa were drier than average, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia, and Brazil.The global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C). The average temperature for European land for summer 2024 was the highest on record at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Summer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe, while most of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe experienced drier-than-average conditions, sometimes associated with drought.The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides detailed monthly climate bulletins based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations worldwide.

Such guidance is based on information available on the date of this press release, and the company assumes no obligation to update it. \nThe company's future performance involves risks and uncertainties, and the company's actual results could differ materially from the information below and elsewhere in this press release. Some of the factors that could affect the company's operating results are set forth under the caption \"Forward-Looking Statements\" above in this press release. More information about factors that could affect the company's operating results is included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form\u00a010-Q, copies of which may be obtained by visiting eBay's investor relations website at https://investors.ebayinc.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\neBay Inc.\n\n\nThree Months Ending\n\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(In billions, except per share amounts)\nGAAP\n\nNon-GAAP (a)\nNet revenues\n$2.50 - $2.56\n\n$2.50 - $2.56\nDiluted EPS\n$0.82 - $0.87\n\n$1.15 - $1.20\n\n\n\n\n(a) Estimated non-GAAP amounts above for the three months ending September 30, 2024 reflect adjustments that exclude the estimated amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $9 - $11 million, estimated stock-based compensation expense and associated employer payroll tax expense of approximately $140 - $150 million, and estimated adjustment between our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of approximately $25 - $35 million. The estimated GAAP diluted EPS above does not assume any gains or losses on our equity investments.\n\u00a0\neBay Inc.Non-GAAP\u00a0Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement the company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free cash flow and figures in this press release presented on an \"FX-Neutral basis.\" These non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate the company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nReconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release, except for figures in this press release presented on an \"FX-Neutral basis,\" can be found in the tables included in this press release. For figures in this press release reported on an \"FX-Neutral basis,\" the company calculates the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates, excluding hedging activity, applied to current year transactional currency amounts.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company's management uses financial measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure and related foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses from the disposal/acquisition of a business, certain gains and losses on investments including changes in fair value, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of any related foreign exchange derivative instruments, gains or losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with Adyen, restructuring-related charges and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, the company's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of the company.\nThe company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income and margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:\nStock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes.\u00a0This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases. The company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on the company's stock price and the vesting of restricted stock by employees and the timing and size of stock option exercises, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the company's operation of the business.\nAmortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, certain amortization of deferred tax assets and related foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and certain gains or losses on investments. The company incurs amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP measures. The company also excludes certain gains and losses on investments. The company excludes the non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure, which is not reduced by the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and related foreign exchange effects. The company excludes these items because management does not believe they correlate to the ongoing operating results of the company's business.\nRestructuring.\u00a0These charges consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes significant restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nOther certain significant gains, losses, or charges that are not indicative of the company's core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly or be repeated in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its results primarily because management does not believe they are indicative of its current or ongoing operating results.\u00a0 These amounts include changes in fair value and the related change in foreign currency exchange rates of equity securities with readily determinable fair values, globally.\nChange in fair market value of warrant.\u00a0These are gains or losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with Adyen, which are attributable to changes in fair value during the period.\nIncome tax effects and adjustments.\u00a0We use a non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating our operating results. Based on our current long-term projections, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5%. This non-GAAP tax rate could change for various reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment. The company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company's business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock and pay dividends. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period and does not exclude certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements.\neBay Inc.\nReconciliation of GAAP\u00a0Operating Income to Non-GAAP\u00a0Operating Income*\n\n\nThree

    "Document2": "Customer Churn Rate: How to Calculate and Improve Churn\n8 min read\nTracking your customer churn rate will help you keep tabs on business growth.\nYou will have data sets for analyzing your churn/retention history, which will better position you to make intelligent business decisions.\nThis article shows you various ways to calculate churn, make sense of the data, and create proactive solutions to retain more customers.\nWhat is customer churn?\nCustomer churn is the rate at which customers discontinue their subscription or stop using a particular product or service.\nChurn could happen for various reasons, from customer dissatisfaction with your brand to changing business needs that make them switch to competitors (more on that later).\nTypes of churn rates you should calculate\nChurn is quite broad. Differentiating the different types will help you track and reduce attrition with ease.\nLet\u2019s go over the most common types of churn:\nHow to calculate the customer churn rate?\nTo calculate customer churn, use this simple formula: Divide the number of users lost during the period of interest by the number of users you had at the start of the period. Multiply the result by 100.\nFor example, imagine you started the year with 700 customers but somehow lost 50 by July. Your churn rate is 50/700 X 100 = 7%\nHow to calculate the revenue churn rate?\nTo calculate revenue churn, divide the net revenue lost from existing customers in a given period by the total revenue at the beginning of the period.\nFor example, if your March loss from downgrades is $4,000 while the MRR is $80,000, your revenue churn is 0.05.\nYou can calculate your revenue churn monthly or annually.\nHaving both numbers provides a more nuanced and complete picture of customer retention. It also helps in identifying short-term trends, setting long-term goals, benchmarking performance, and making critical decisions to improve customer retention.\nMonthly churn rate formula\nYour monthly churn rate refers to the percentage of customers lost over a month.\nHow to calculate: (number of customers you had at the beginning of the month) \u2013 (number of customers you had at the end of the month) / number of customers you had at the beginning of the month X 100.\nMonthly tracking comes with several benefits. For instance, you can use the data for cohort and retention analysis or to create a churn prediction model that tells you which months of the year customers are more likely to churn.\nAnnual churn rate formula\nThe annual churn rate is the percentage of customers you lose in a year. Similar to the monthly churn rate, calculate this metric by dividing the number of customers lost in a year by the number you had at the start of the year. Multiply the figure by 100.\nAnnual churn rates will flatten out the influence of seasonality or marketing campaigns on churn so you can see your business\u2019s long-term story and set benchmarks for yourself.\nHow to use the adjusted churn rate formula?\nFast-growing companies might struggle with a churn rate formula that only accounts for lost customers.\nA more complex formula showing churned customers while also including the users added in that period will provide more accurate data.\nUse the following formula to get a better picture of your churn rate:\n(Y / [ (W+X) / 2 ] ) x 100 = Z\nWhat is a good churn rate: SaaS customer churn benchmarks\nThe ideal churn rate varies, depending on your growth stage.\nFor established SaaS companies, the average is between 5% to 7% churn per year and around 1% or less monthly.\nEarly-stage startups will understandably have higher churn as they\u2019re still getting their footing, may still be struggling with product-market fit, or have products needing improvement. If you\u2019re an early-stage startup or SMB, expect an average annual churn of 10% to 15%.\nChurn also depends on your industry. Subscription management platform Recurly sampled over 1,500 sites in 19 months and reported how churn rates differ between industries. Take a look:\nMost common reasons behind high churn rates\nChurn can happen for a thousand and one reason. But here are the most common ones:\nOther metrics subscription-based companies should track\nBy tracking the following metrics, you\u2019ll have a more holistic understanding of your business and identify improvement areas:\n7 Customer retention strategies to reduce customer churn rates\nWe\u2019ve already discussed numerous ways to calculate, track, and benchmark churn. The next logical step would be actively working on improving your rates.\nImplement the following strategies to increase customer retention in your SaaS:\nPersonalize user onboarding for different customer segments\nPersonalization streamlines your onboarding flow and ensures users only see the features they need. Users will experience value fast, reach activation quickly, and be more willing to stick with you.\nYou can create personalized onboarding by using a welcome survey to collect new user data. Focus your survey questions on understanding the user\u2019s pain points and jobs to be done. Use that data to personalize their onboarding paths.\nUse interactive walkthroughs to contextually guide new customers\nInteractive walkthroughs show users how to use a feature step-by-step. Trigger it contextually to eliminate confusion and help users gain value from your features.\nThis is much better than bland product tours\u2014or worse, leaving users to figure out your tool on their own.\nContextual guidance improves feature adoption rates, and churn will reduce as customers begin to use and find your features valuable.\nLeverage secondary onboarding to retain existing customers\nOnboarding doesn\u2019t stop when new customers start using your tool comfortably. Employ secondary onboarding\u2014introduce users to more advanced features and use cases once they\u2019ve adopted the key features.\nYou can do this with contextual in-app messages such as modals, hotspots, tooltips, etc.\nSecondary onboarding drives repeated value and improves product adoption breadth and depth. Churn also reduces because the more users integrate the product into their lives, the less likely they are to stop using it.\nMeasure customer satisfaction across the user journey\nUse short microsurveys to measure customer satisfaction at different touchpoints. The typical CSAT survey is quantitative, but you can also ask follow-up questions for qualitative insights. Combining both will help you better understand what causes dissatisfaction.\nThe next step is to segment unhappy customers and proactively reach out to them to offer help and prevent churn.\nOffer self-serve support to remove friction and improve customer experience\nMaking customers who already have a problem wait for hours before receiving help will only push them away further. Prevent this by building robust self-serve support that allows users to get quick and easy help no matter the time of day.\nYou can go one step further and personalize the help according to users\u2019 JTBD and place it in the customer journey. For example, you might have sections such as \u201cGetting Started,\u201d \u201cTroubleshooting,\u201d \u201cAdvanced Features,\u201d \u201cAccount Management,\u201d etc.\nYou can also utilize user data and behavior to dynamically recommend relevant knowledge base content.\nTrack in-app customer behavior to identify at-risk customers\nDefinitely keep tabs on customer pulse and monitor user behavior to identify drops and spikes in user activity. Try to analyze further to find the reasons for the sudden changes.\nSegment disengaged users and trigger re-engagement flows to win them over. This could be anything from win-back email campaigns to tooltips that prompt users to engage with a key feature that will bring value to them.\nCollect feedback from churned customers to understand what went wrong\nChurn surveys let you know the reasons behind churn and fix them to prevent other customers from leaving for the same reasons.\nAs with every survey, timing is important here. Trigger your churn surveys in-app as soon as users hit the cancel account button. No one will go ahead and answer a survey they got via email after they finished canceling their account.\nConclusion\nEnsure to regularly track churn rates (monthly is ideal). This will enable you to make data-driven decisions that proactively prevent churn among new and existing users.\nUserpilot can help with that. As previously mentioned, our platform lets you understand churn through user behavior tracking and in-app surveys and triggers customized product experiences to drive retention.\nBook a demo now to talk with our team and begin the process of reducing the customer churn rate for your business!\nLeave a comment Cancel reply\n Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nThe fastest way to learn about Product Growth,Management & Trends.\nThe coolest way to learn about Product Growth, Management & Trends.\nDelivered fresh to your inbox, weekly.\n\n\n\nGet The Insights!\nThe fastest way to learn about Product Growth,\nManagement & Trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also be interested in ...What Are AARRR Metrics?

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\u00a0\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\u00a0\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\r\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\r\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work.

    "Document2": "Alibaba Group\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue grew 7% year-over-year to RMB221.87 billion ($30.73 billion), edging ahead of forecasts as it notched wins across its core e-commerce and cloud businesses.\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31 outpaced Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimate of approximately RMB219.80 billion, while revenue for the 2024 fiscal year rose 8% year-over-year to RMB941.17 billion.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen early results from increased investment in our strategic business priorities and are confident in our business outlook,\u201d said Toby Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group.\nAlibaba\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) for the quarter decreased 5% year-over-year to RMB23.97 billion, primarily due to increased investment in its e-commerce businesses and one-time retention incentives for employees of logistics arm Cainiao. Quarterly non-GAAP net income declined 11% year-over-year to RMB24.42 billion.\nAlibaba increased its capital expenditure on Alibaba Cloud infrastructure and its Chinese and cross-border e-commerce businesses, leading to double-digit growth across key metrics including gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that our strategies are working and we are returning to growth,\u201d said Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.\nThe company also announced a $4.0 billion dividend distribution to continuously enhance shareholder return.\nAlibaba\u2019s e-commerce businesses recorded an uptick in purchasing frequency and customer retention over the quarter, even as retail growth slowed in China.\nAcross the country, total retail sales of consumer goods in March grew 3.1% year-over-year, trailing the 5.5% and 7.4% growth recorded in the January-February and December periods, respectively, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.\nDespite the broader slowdown, revenue during the latest quarter grew 4% year-on-year to RMB93.22 billion at Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG).\nTTG\u2019s adjusted EBITA shrank slightly to RMB38.5 billion compared to RMB39.04 billion in the same quarter of 2023, as the business increased strategic investment in areas including customer service, membership program benefits and technology.\n\u201cOur China and international commerce businesses realized double-digit year-over-year GMV growth through our focus on the customer experience,\u201d said Wu, who stepped into the role of Taobao and Tmall Group CEO last year.\nHe has emphasized that 2024 would be a year of strategic upgrades and significant investment into the core businesses, and it has started to bear fruit.\nOnline gross merchandise value \u2013 excluding unpaid orders \u2013 and order growth expanded by double-digits year-over-year, fueling a 5% increase in customer management revenue.\nMembership in TTG\u2019s 88VIP loyalty program increased by double digits year-over-year in the quarter to top 35 million members, as consumers were enticed by improving service and more benefits.\nTaobao has introduced more user-friendly measures including a simplified 6.18 sales structure and a website update. Likewise, Tmall announced plans to triple the scale of resources dedicated to new products.\nBetween January and March, the number of new merchants on Tmall rose 60% year-over-year, while the total transaction volume of new merchants over this time increased by 150% compared with last year.\nQuarterly revenue from the company\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group rose 3% to RMB25.60 billion, driven by the double-digit growth of its public cloud business.\nAlibaba Cloud\u2019s public cloud offerings are available online for organizations and individuals alike, and include elastic compute, database and AI products and services. The company saw triple-digit growth in AI-related revenue in the fourth quarter.\nTo attract start-ups and small businesses that will support long-term growth, Alibaba recently slashed the price of over 100 core public cloud products in the Chinese market.\nIn April, the company also extended these cost reductions to international customers, with an average price reduction of 23%.\n\u201cWe are excited by the accelerated growth of customers and cloud computing revenues related to our AI products. We will remain focused on our strategic priorities and capture future growth opportunities,\u201d said Wu.\nOver 90,000 enterprises have adopted Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen large language model (LLM) since it debuted a year ago, on top of more than 7 million downloads on open-source platforms like Github.\nAlibaba Cloud recently launched a service to help companies customize and scale generative AI models, from consolidating multiple models to optimizing underlying infrastructure resources.\nIn addition, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI-driven sustainability platform Energy Expert rolled out an open API service enabling developers to build customized sustainability applications.\nIts AI computing platform for high-performance computing tasks, PAI-Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service, became available in Singapore for the first time this year.\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) marketplaces notched a 20% increase in combined orders for the latest quarter as revenue grew 45% year-over-year to RMB27.45 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nCross-border retail platform AliExpress provides price-competitive products and efficient fulfillment under its Choice service, which accounted for around 70% of AliExpress\u2019s total orders in April 2024.\nIncreased synergies between AliExpress and Cainiao led five to ten-day delivery completion rates to double year-over-year for Choice orders over the quarter.\nCainiao, which withdrew its plan to make an initial public offering on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange in March partly to focus on supporting cross-border fulfillment services within AIDC, has also gone from strength to strength.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue from Cainiao grew 30% year-over-year to RMB24.56 billion. Cainiao\u2019s five to ten-day delivery service extended into four additional countries during the quarter, bringing the number of countries covered by the premium service to 14.\nInvestment in cross-border initiatives ramped up across the board in the fourth quarter.\nTurkish online retailer Trendyol expanded into the Gulf region and has become one of the region\u2019s most downloaded e-commerce apps. At the same time, AliExpress earmarked millions of euros for discounts and deals as part of an exclusive global sponsorship of the upcoming UEFA European Football Championship set for this summer.\nAs a result of increased investment in key markets to enhance customer experience and expand consumer base, AIDC posted a loss of RMB4.09 billion in the quarter for adjusted EBITA.\nAs part of management\u2019s commitment to delivering value to shareholders, Alibaba has announced a two-part dividend worth an aggregate $4.0 billion.\nThe Alibaba board approved an annual regular cash dividend for the most recent fiscal year and an extraordinary cash dividend comprised of proceeds from the disposition of certain financial investments.\nThe one-time extraordinary dividend will come to $0.0825 per ordinary share or $0.66 per ADS and will be paid in U.S. dollars to holders of ordinary shares and ADSs as of the close of business on June 13, 2024, Hong Kong Time and New York Time, respectively.\n\u201cWe are committed to continuing to return value to our shareholders,\u201d said Alibaba\u2019s Xu.\nEarlier this year, the group said it would begin voluntary updates on its share repurchase program to increase transparency for investors.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Alibaba repurchased 1.25 billion ordinary shares for a total of $12.5 billion, including 524 million ordinary shares repurchased in its fourth fiscal quarter.\nAlibaba\u2019s total shareholder yield, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, led its large-cap peers by reaching 6.5% during the 2023 calendar year.\nThe holding company, which made its 2014 stock market debut in New York and completed a secondary listing in Hong Kong in 2019, is also in the midst of preparations for a dual-primary listing on the two bourses slated for the end of August 2024.",

Today, we will delve deep into eBay revenue throughout the years, eBay sales statistics by category, and much more.\nOn this page\nWhen Was eBay Established?\nEstablished in 1995 as a platform for auction-style sales, eBay swiftly expanded its horizons, becoming a global marketplace for both new and second-hand items. Today, its influence stretches across continents, reaching millions of buyers and sellers alike. The statistics provided in this article are intended to give eBay sellers with insight into potential eBay selling opportunities.\nMake Money Selling on eBay!\neBay Statistic Overview\nOnline marketplaces have revolutionized the way we shop, offering a wide array of products at our fingertips. A recent study by Statista sheds light on the dominance and reach of these platforms in the U.S. market as of April 2023.\nAmazon is at the top of the list, with a whopping 58.03% share of online visits. Trailing behind, but still maintaining a strong presence, is eBay with a 13.11% share. The results demonstrate eBay\u2019s enduring relevance, even in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.\nWalmart also maintains its lead in the online market with a 6.53% share, demonstrating its successful transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a significant online player. Etsy, known for unique and handmade items, accounted for 5.02% of visits.\nLastly, Target, another retail giant, holds a 2.64% share, underscoring its efforts to boost its online footprint. These eBay stats emphasize the competitive nature of online retail and highlight the importance of innovation and customer engagement in retaining and growing market share.\nMORE: How to increase sales on eBay\nWhat Does This Mean for eBay Sellers?\nFirst and foremost, despite the towering presence of Amazon, eBay still commands a respectable 13.11% share of online visits as of April 2023. This indicates that eBay remains a formidable platform with a vast and engaged customer base. Sellers can leverage this large audience to diversify their online presence and reach a different segment of buyers.\nHowever, the competition is fierce. With Amazon dominating the market, eCommerce sellers must bring their A-game when listing on eBay. This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\nMORE: How to sell on eBay and make money\neBay Seller Statistics\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\neCommerce\u2019s Share of Total Retail Sales in the US\nMORE: eBay vacation mode\neBay Advertising Statistics\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\nMORE: How to set up an eBay store\neBay Buyer Statistics\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\nMORE: How to issue partial refund on eBay\nHow Many People Use eBay\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\nNumber of eBay total active buyers from 1st Quarter 2010 to 2nd Quarter 2023 (in millions)\nA Shift After 2018\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\nMORE: eBay seller help\nMORE: eBay refurbished\neBay Website Traffic Share\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States. Of these U.S. eBay visitors, 54 percent favored using desktop devices to access the site. However, in other examined countries, most users showed a preference for mobile browsing.\nMORE: How to ship items on eBay\neBay\u2019s Second-Hand Purchase Trend\nAnother important buyer statistic is the share of eBay buyers purchasing second-hand goods in order to save money in 2022.\nThe appeal of online marketplaces like eBay is frequently based on the diverse range of products they offer, which varies from brand-new items to second-hand or used goods. An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\nMORE: eBay selling tips\nMORE: eBay selling limits\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023. During the observed time frame, the highest monthly downloads worldwide occurred in January 2021, reaching 3.4 million for that month.\nMORE: Shopify eBay integration\neBay Sales Statistics by Category\nIn February 2021, nearly a year after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable face masks dominated eBay sales, averaging over 293 items sold for each listing every week. Mobile phones and smartphones also ranked high in sales, with listings selling an average of 76 units weekly.\nAlso see our\u00a0eBay Fee Calculator.\nKey Takeaways\nIn the rapidly shifting eCommerce landscape, sellers must remain agile and informed. Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend. Thus, sellers need a strategic, adaptive, and diversified approach to maximize their reach and sales in this ever-evolving market.\nMORE: Discover Amazon Statistics.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nHow popular is eBay now?\nWhat age group uses eBay the most?\nIs eBay getting less popular?\nWho is eBay's target audience?\nWho is the #1 seller on eBay?\nAuthor\nDominika Kaminska\nAmazing content you need, amazing content we deliver.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.

Learn about our fact-checking process.\n\nWhether you\u2019re already an eBay seller or only thinking about selling on eBay occasionally, statistics are a sure way to prove which direction is best to consider for your online store. Today, we will delve deep into eBay revenue throughout the years, eBay sales statistics by category, and much more.\n\nWhen Was eBay Established?\n\nEstablished in 1995 as a platform for auction-style sales, eBay swiftly expanded its horizons, becoming a global marketplace for both new and second-hand items. Today, its influence stretches across continents, reaching millions of buyers and sellers alike. The statistics provided in this article are intended to give eBay sellers insight into potential eBay selling opportunities.\n\nMake Money Selling on eBay!\n\neBay Statistic Overview\n\nOnline marketplaces have revolutionized the way we shop, offering a wide array of products at our fingertips. A recent study by Statista sheds light on the dominance and reach of these platforms in the U.S. market as of April 2023.\n\nAmazon is at the top of the list, with a whopping 58.03% share of online visits. Trailing behind, but still maintaining a strong presence, is eBay with a 13.11% share. The results demonstrate eBay\u2019s enduring relevance, even in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.\n\nWalmart also maintains its lead in the online market with a 6.53% share, demonstrating its successful transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a significant online player. Etsy, known for unique and handmade items, accounted for 5.02% of visits. Lastly, Target, another retail giant, holds a 2.64% share, underscoring its efforts to boost its online footprint. These eBay stats emphasize the competitive nature of online retail and highlight the importance of innovation and customer engagement in retaining and growing market share.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for eBay Sellers?\n\nFirst and foremost, despite the towering presence of Amazon, eBay still commands a respectable 13.11% share of online visits as of April 2023. This indicates that eBay remains a formidable platform with a vast and engaged customer base. Sellers can leverage this large audience to diversify their online presence and reach a different segment of buyers.\n\nHowever, the competition is fierce. With Amazon dominating the market, eCommerce sellers must bring their A-game when listing on eBay. This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\n\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\n\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\n\neBay Seller Statistics\n\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\n\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\n\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\n\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\n\neBay Advertising Statistics\n\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\n\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\n\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\n\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\n\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\n\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\n\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\n\neBay Buyer Statistics\n\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\n\nHow Many People Use eBay\n\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\n\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\n\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\n\nA Shift After 2018\n\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\n\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\n\neBay Website Traffic Share\n\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States. Of these U.S. eBay visitors, 54 percent favored using desktop devices to access the site. However, in other examined countries, most users showed a preference for mobile browsing.\n\neBay\u2019s Second-Hand Purchase Trend\n\nAnother important buyer statistic is the share of eBay buyers purchasing second-hand goods in order to save money in 2022.\n\nThe appeal of online marketplaces like eBay is frequently based on the diverse range of products they offer, which varies from brand-new items to second-hand or used goods. An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\n\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\n\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\n\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\n\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\n\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023. During the observed time frame, the highest monthly downloads worldwide occurred in January 2021, reaching 3.4 million for that month.\n\neBay Sales Statistics by Category\n\nIn February 2021, nearly a year after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable face masks dominated eBay sales, averaging over 293 items sold for each listing every week. Mobile phones and smartphones also ranked high in sales, with listings selling an average of 76 units weekly.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIn the rapidly shifting eCommerce landscape, sellers must remain agile and informed. Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\n\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend. Thus, sellers need a strategic, adaptive, and diversified approach to maximize their reach and sales in this ever-evolving market.",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, Amazon Studios, and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by Amazon.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, Amazon Studios, and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by Amazon.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, Amazon Studios, and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by Amazon.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\u00a0\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates.

    "Document2": "UT Austin Enrolls Largest-Ever Student Body, Sets All-Time Highs for Graduation Rates\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 This fall, The University of Texas at Austin has admitted its largest-ever incoming class and enrolled more students than ever before. The university has 9,109 first-time, first-year undergraduates, according to data collected on the 12th class day of the current fall term, surpassing the record high from the previous year of 9,060. Total university enrollment rose to 52,384, surpassing the all-time high of 52,261 set in 2002.\u00a0\nThe increases, which followed another year of strong application numbers, were made possible in large part by the university\u2019s continued commitment to improving four- and six-year graduation rates, where UT Austin once again set all-time highs in both categories. The four-year rate rose to 73.5% this year, an increase of 21 percentage points since 2012, while the six-year rate rose to 87.8%, a gain of nine percentage points during the past decade.\u00a0\nGraduation rates at UT have shown consistent improvement since 2011, when the university set a goal of increasing the four-year graduation rate from 52% to 70%. Beginning in 2012-2013, the university implemented campus-wide student success programs and analyzed student data to provide proactive support for students to help them define and stick with a path toward graduation. The programs offer peer mentoring, academic support and scholarship access to help more incoming students succeed in college.\u00a0\n\u201cYear after year, increasingly more of the most outstanding students from across Texas and beyond want to enroll at our world-class university,\u201d said UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. \u201cImproved graduation rates reduce students\u2019 expenses and allow them to generate income sooner, while also expanding opportunities for incoming students who seek the rigorous education and vibrant college experience that UT offers.\u201d\u00a0\nThe university is also welcoming more first-generation and historically underrepresented groups than ever, while continuing to serve some of its highest numbers of students eligible for Pell grants, which are available to low-income families. Once in the classroom, these students are following the university\u2019s overall trends, performing at consistently higher levels relative to the university\u2019s historical norms.

    "Summarized_Document2": "UT Austin Enrolls Largest-Ever Student Body, Sets All-Time Highs for Graduation Rates\n\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 This fall, The University of Texas at Austin has admitted its largest-ever incoming class and enrolled more students than ever before. The university has 9,109 first-time, first-year undergraduates, surpassing the previous year's record of 9,060. Total university enrollment rose to 52,384, surpassing the all-time high of 52,261 set in 2002.\n\nThe increases were made possible by the university\u2019s commitment to improving four- and six-year graduation rates, setting all-time highs in both categories. The four-year rate rose to 73.5% this year, an increase of 21 percentage points since 2012, while the six-year rate rose to 87.8%, a gain of nine percentage points over the past decade.\n\nGraduation rates at UT have shown consistent improvement since 2011, when the university set a goal of increasing the four-year graduation rate from 52% to 70%. Starting in 2012-2013, the university implemented student success programs and analyzed student data to provide proactive support. These programs offer peer mentoring, academic support, and scholarship access.\n\n\u201cYear after year, increasingly more of the most outstanding students from across Texas and beyond want to enroll at our world-class university,\u201d said UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. \u201cImproved graduation rates reduce students\u2019 expenses and allow them to generate income sooner, while also expanding opportunities for incoming students.\u201d\n\nThe university is also welcoming more first-generation and historically underrepresented groups than ever, while continuing to serve high numbers of students eligible for Pell grants. Four-year graduation rates for Black, Hispanic, first-generation, and Pell-eligible students have increased, on average, by 27 percentage points since 2012, narrowing the gap with the university\u2019s overall graduation rate.\n\nThe number and percentage of historically underrepresented students rose to their highest levels ever, now representing 33.6% of the undergraduate population and 30.3% of the university as a whole. UT Austin will educate 13,872 historically underrepresented students in 2022, one of the largest totals of any state flagship university or member of the Association of American Universities.\n\nHispanic enrollment reached all-time highs, with the percentage of Hispanic undergraduates rising to 27.9% from 27.1% last year. Hispanic students made up 29.5% of first-year undergraduates this fall.\n\nThe number of Black undergraduate students increased to 2,269 this fall from 2,219 last fall, with the total number of Black students (graduate and undergraduate) increasing to 2,759 from 2,728.\n\nEnrollment of first-generation undergraduate students rose to 9,636 from 9,387 last year, representing 23.3% of all current undergraduates.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to recruiting talented students with diverse backgrounds and experiences,\u201d said Hartzell. \u201cThe gains we have made are a testament to this effort, as well as our campaign pledge to raise $1 billion for scholarships and student support programs.\u201d\n\nNumbers for international students also rose, to 5,117 (9.8% of all students) this year from 4,725 (9.1% of all students) in 2021.\n\n* Preliminary as of 12th class day | ** Black includes both \u201cBlack or African American alone\u201d and \u201cBlack or African American Multiracial (excluding Hispanic) | ***Reflects earliest verifiable data from 2014\n\nNotable fall enrollment figures year over year, fall 2021 to fall 2022:\n\nAll 2022 figures in this release are as of the 12th class day and therefore preliminary.

Note: Public school enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students, but do not include students attending joint-vocational districts and educational service centers, pupils attending non-public schools, or home schooled students. More information about those enrollments are found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchool Options\u00e2\u0080\u009d section.\nPublic School Enrollment by Grade\u00a0Level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23).\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest race/ethnic student groups, white and African American students, has also declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent change from 2006 to 2023. The chart displays the spring part of the school year, a convention often used in this guide.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, public school enrollment has increased significantly among Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander students.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends by Selected Characteristics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, English learner enrollment has more than doubled, while the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The number of students identified as gifted has declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nLow Income Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe percentage of students identified as economically disadvantaged has increased since 2005-06. However, the percentage of Ohio children living in poverty has remained mostly static.\nSource: Economically disadvantaged data are from Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23); childhood poverty data are from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Kids Count Data Center and based on U.S. Census poverty estimates (data were not reported for 2020 and are not yet available for 2023). Notes: Ohio identifies students as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomically disadvantaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d via federal meal programs, open to pupils from households with incomes at or below 185% of federal poverty. However, in 2010, Congress passed the Community Eligibility Provision which allows certain schools to deem all students as disadvantaged (even higher-income children) for the purposes of meals eligibility. In contrast, children in poverty are from households at or below 100% federal poverty.\nOhio School Districts and Typologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor analytic purposes, the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce categorizes districts into eight typologies based on their geographic and socio-economic characteristics. This publication displays various statistics by typology to illustrate patterns of enrollment and achievement across the state.\nSource: Ohio DEW, School District Typology. Note: This map displays the border of each district and its corresponding typology.\nPublic School Students by Typology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas and 35 percent are from suburban communities; 21 percent live in small towns while 15 percent are from rural areas.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: Public charter and STEM schools are assigned to the typology of the district in which the school is located, as reported in DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community school directory. Online charters\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as e-schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094are not included in a typology, since they can enroll students statewide.\nPublic School Students in Urban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents living in urban areas come from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, and almost nine in ten are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the urban typologies (i.e., urban: very high poverty and urban: high poverty).\nPublic School Students in Suburban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from suburban areas are majority white, with modest racial and ethnic diversity. About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the suburban typologies (i.e., suburban: very low poverty and suburban: low poverty).\nPublic School Students in Small Town Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe large majority of students from small towns are white and more than two in five are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the small town typologies (i.e., small town: high poverty and small town: low poverty).\nPublic School Students in Rural Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from rural areas are overwhelmingly white and just under half are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the rural typologies (i.e., rural: average poverty and rural: high poverty).\nOhio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twenty-Five Largest Districts by Enrollment (2022-23)\nNote: Ohio Virtual Academy, a statewide e-school, is considered equivalent to a school district. This table does not include charter or STEM students as part of the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student population. Enrollment changes of less than +/- 1 percent are considered to have had no substantive change (marked as \u00e2\u0080\u009c--\u00e2\u0080\u009c).\nSchoolOptions\n\nEnrollment by Educational Model\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, while more than 110,000 students attend charter schools and more than 200,000 students attend non-public schools or homeschool.\nSources: All data are for 2022-23 and drawn from various sources from Ohio DEW.\nPublic Charter Schools\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 334 charter schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as community schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094serving more than 110,000 students.\nSources: Ohio DEW downloadable file titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d was used to calculate enrollments for 2022-23 and the community school directory was used to identify the type of charter school. Historical enrollment data were drawn from DEW, Community School Annual Report: 2021-2022.\nCharacteristics of Charter School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of charter school students are economically disadvantaged, and a majority are Black or Hispanic. Nearly 70 percent of charter school students attend brick-and-mortar charters located in urban communities.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23). Note: All statistics in this table include online charter schools; they are not assigned to district typologies, however, because they can draw students from all areas of the state.\nInterdistrict Open Enrollment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFour in five Ohio districts participate in interdistrict open enrollment. Approximately 80,000 students open enroll, with participation generally, until recently, increasing over time.\nSources: Two sources were used for this chart, based on the availability of data. For 2002-03 to 2011-12, data from the Ohio Auditor of State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 report, Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Open Enrollment were used. For 2012-13 to 2022-23, enrollments are calculated based on school districts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 funding reports; see Ohio DEW, Traditional Public Schools Funding.\nPrivate School Scholarships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore than 80,000 students used state-funded scholarships (often referred to as vouchers) to attend private schools in 2022-23.\nSource: Historical Historical data through 2020-21 are from American Federation for Children, School Choice Yearbook (2021). Ohio DEW began recently reporting more detailed voucher data and beginning with 2021-22, numbers are from Advanced Reports.

    "Document2": "UT Austin Enrolls Largest-Ever Student Body, Sets All-Time Highs for Graduation Rates\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 This fall, The University of Texas at Austin has admitted its largest-ever incoming class and enrolled more students than ever before. The university has 9,109 first-time, first-year undergraduates, according to data collected on the 12th class day of the current fall term, surpassing the record high from the previous year of 9,060. Total university enrollment rose to 52,384, surpassing the all-time high of 52,261 set in 2002.\u00a0\nThe increases, which followed another year of strong application numbers, were made possible in large part by the university\u2019s continued commitment to improving four- and six-year graduation rates, where UT Austin once again set all-time highs in both categories. The four-year rate rose to 73.5% this year, an increase of 21 percentage points since 2012, while the six-year rate rose to 87.8%, a gain of nine percentage points during the past decade.\u00a0\nGraduation rates at UT have shown consistent improvement since 2011, when the university set a goal of increasing the four-year graduation rate from 52% to 70%. Beginning in 2012-2013, the university implemented campus-wide student success programs and analyzed student data to provide proactive support for students to help them define and stick with a path toward graduation. The programs offer peer mentoring, academic support and scholarship access to help more incoming students succeed in college.\u00a0\n\u201cYear after year, increasingly more of the most outstanding students from across Texas and beyond want to enroll at our world-class university,\u201d said UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. \u201cImproved graduation rates reduce students\u2019 expenses and allow them to generate income sooner, while also expanding opportunities for incoming students who seek the rigorous education and vibrant college experience that UT offers.\u201d\u00a0\nThe university is also welcoming more first-generation and historically underrepresented groups than ever, while continuing to serve some of its highest numbers of students eligible for Pell grants, which are available to low-income families. Once in the classroom, these students are following the university\u2019s overall trends, performing at consistently higher levels relative to the university\u2019s historical norms. Four-year graduation rates for Black, Hispanic, first-generation and Pell-eligible students have increased, on average, by 27 percentage points since 2012, and each group has narrowed the gap with the university\u2019s overall graduation rate.\u00a0\nOverall, the university\u2019s number and percentage of historically underrepresented students \u2014 who identify as Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander \u2014 rose to their highest levels ever, now representing 33.6% of the undergraduate population and 30.3% of the university as a whole. At the undergraduate level alone, UT Austin will educate 13,872 historically underrepresented students in 2022, one of the largest totals of any state flagship university or member of the prestigious Association of American Universities.\u00a0\u00a0\nHispanic enrollment again reached all-time highs, further cementing the university\u2019s trajectory as one of the country\u2019s largest and most academically prestigious Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). The percentage of Hispanic undergraduates rose to 27.9% from 27.1% last year, and Hispanic students made up a plurality of 29.5% of first-year undergraduates this fall.\u00a0\nThe number of Black undergraduate students also increased, to 2,269 this fall from 2,219 last fall, with the number of Black students overall (graduate and undergraduate) increasing to 2,759 from 2,728.\u00a0\u00a0\nEnrollment of first-generation undergraduate students rose to 9,636 from 9,387 last year, representing 23.3% of all current undergraduates.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are committed to recruiting talented students with diverse backgrounds and experiences,\u201d said Hartzell. \u201cThe gains we have made are a testament to this effort, as well as our campaign pledge to raise $1 billion for scholarships and student support programs that will continue to expand opportunities for Longhorns from traditionally underserved communities.\u201d\u00a0\nNumbers for international students also rose, to 5,117 (9.8% of all students) this year from 4,725 (9.1% of all students) in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Preliminary as of 12th class day\u202f|\u202f** Black includes both \u201cBlack or African American alone\u201d and \u201cBlack or African American Multiracial (excluding Hispanic) | ***Reflects earliest verifiable data from 2014\u00a0\nNotable fall enrollment figures year over year, fall 2021 to fall 2022:\u00a0\nAll 2022 figures in this release are as of the 12th class day and therefore preliminary.

The university has 9,109 first-time, first-year undergraduates, surpassing the previous year's record of 9,060. Total university enrollment rose to 52,384, surpassing the all-time high of 52,261 set in 2002.\n\nThe increases were made possible by the university\u2019s commitment to improving four- and six-year graduation rates, setting all-time highs in both categories.

Today, most college and university students in the U.S. take at least some classes online.\nOnline degrees have a broad reach, encompassing new higher education concepts like microcredentials and massive open online courses (MOOCs), along with traditional college degrees.\nDistance learners, too, are a diverse group. As a remote student, your peers may include traditional college-age students, working parents, military service members, established professionals and lifelong learners.\nThis fast-growing field clearly holds wide appeal, but how big is online learning, exactly?\nThis article examines the popularity of online learning, charting how fast the field has grown in recent years and exploring the motivations behind distance learning. If you\u2019re a prospective or current online student, a parent or an educator\u2014or if you\u2019re just curious about the online learning phenomenon\u2014these are the key statistics to know.\nKey Takeaways\nOnline Learning by the Numbers\nAll types of colleges and universities offer classes online. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), public colleges enrolled about 8.5 million online students in 2021. Another 2.7 million remote learners attended private schools, including 1.9 million at nonprofit institutions and nearly 800,000 at for-profit schools.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the availability of online learning in higher education starting in 2020. NCES reports that 75% of all postsecondary students in the U.S.\u2014over 14 million learners\u2014took online classes in fall 2020 as the pandemic restricted in-person learning, whereas only 36% had enrolled in distance education in fall 2019.\nWith many schools opening classrooms for in-person learning again in 2021, the percentage of students enrolled in distance learning courses dropped to about 60%\u2014still much higher than in pre-pandemic years.\nOnline enrollment levels vary depending on where students live. Alaska, Hawai\u2019i and New Hampshire boast the highest percentages of online students in the United States.\nOnline Schools vs. Traditional College\nMany online degree seekers attend traditional schools, but as of 2020, about 15% of all U.S. college students attended primarily online institutions. NCES defines primarily online schools as those enrolling 90% or more of their student body in distance education. About 11% of U.S. colleges and universities\u2014422 institutions in total\u2014fit this profile.\nOften catering to working students, some online schools have always offered fully remote programs. Others began as traditional campus-based institutions, later establishing online divisions that grew to dwarf their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\nIn 2020, primarily online schools enrolled over 1.5 million full-time degree seekers. Another 1.2 million learners took classes part time. Female students outnumbered male students among both full-time and part-time enrollees, making up about 62% of all learners.\nOnline Learning Through the Years\nIn 2020, the onset of Covid-19 disrupted traditional education, abruptly forcing students, instructors and administrators to adapt to remote learning models.\nEven before the pandemic, however, remote learning had been growing steadily for almost a decade as daily life became more digitized and remote learning technology and infrastructure improved.\nIn 2012\u2014a watershed year in online education that saw the founding of MOOC giants edX and Coursera\u2014over 25% of U.S. college and university students took at least one distance learning course, NCES reports. By 2019, that number had risen to 36%, about half of whom attended exclusively online.\nIn 2020, the number of online students at traditional higher education institutions exploded as schools shifted courses online amid lockdown restrictions. During that year, about 46% of U.S. learners studied entirely online, and another 28% took at least some courses remotely. As of 2021, remote learning numbers remained high, with about 60% of college students taking some or all of their classes online.\nMany traditional degree-seeking students returned to in-person learning when schools reopened in 2021, but online education as a whole continued to grow.\nThe World Economic Forum reports that in 2016, Coursera had 21 million registered users. By 2019, 44 million learners used the MOOC platform. This number leaped to 71 million in 2020, but unlike online college enrollment numbers, Coursera\u2019s enrollment did not drop in 2021. Instead, the platform gained even more users, totaling 92 million in 2022.\nOnline Degrees\nRemote learning programs serve this growing body of online students with degree programs at all levels. NCES reports that in the 2019-20 academic year, primarily online colleges conferred:\nMale-identifying students earned 37% to 39% of these degrees, with female-identifying students earning 61% to 63%.\nStudents at primarily online schools make up 14.7% of all college and university enrollees. They earn:\nOnline doctoral programs are relatively uncommon; remote learners earn only 7.6% of all doctorates.\nOnline Learning by Race\nOnline schools serve a racially diverse student body, with more than half of all learners identifying as nonwhite. These institutions enroll minority learners at higher rates than conventional schools across most reported categories, as shown in the chart below.\nIlana Hamilton is a writer and editor specializing in education and career topics.
