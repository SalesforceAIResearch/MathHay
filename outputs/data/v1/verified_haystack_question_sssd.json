But which tech behemoth is better positioned for future growth?\nAmazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) are two of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands and Wall Street\u2019s most coveted stocks, and the long-term trajectory of each blue-chip stock is still decidedly up. Plus, it\u2019s estimated that roughly 40% of all web traffic is hosted by those two companies combined. But which looks like the better buy today, AMZN stock or GOOG stock?\nBoth stocks were beaten down by the growth stock sell-off of 2022. GOOG has suffered less damage from all the selling, down 6% since the start of 2022 vs. AMZN\u2019s 13% loss. Going back a bit further, to just after the March 2020 Covid crash, the performance of both stocks has been far more palatable, with GOOG up 126% in since March 13, 2020, vs. a 63% gain for AMZN. Over the last five years, GOOG is up 156% vs. an 83% gain in AMZN.\nThose are strong returns for GOOG, especially when compared to the 64% return in the S&P 500 in the last five years. Amazon though? Not so much. Now the question is: Can AMZN and GOOG repeat or beat that performance over the next five years?\n[text_ad]\nIt would be foolish to doubt either company at this point. That said, no stock continues to grow at a breakneck pace forever. Just ask anyone who bought General Electric (GE) 10 or 15 years ago, when it ranked among the 10 largest companies in the world by market cap. So chances are, one or both of these blue-chip tech stocks will start to slow in the years ahead.\nGiven that backdrop, I thought it might be a fun exercise to examine which tech giant stock is better positioned for future growth.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at AMZN stock and GOOG stock, broken into a few key numbers:\nTrailing P/Es: AMZN 76, GOOG 26\nForward P/Es: AMZN 42, GOOG 20\nEstimated 2023 revenue growth: AMZN 11%, GOOG 8.2%\nEstimated 2023 EPS growth: AMZN 1,089%, GOOG 51.4%\nCash per share: AMZN $6.21, GOOG $9.58\nInstitutional ownership: AMZN 61%, GOOG 62%\nThat comparison tells us that AMZN is still the more overvalued stock. However, until recently it had been the faster-growing company on both the top and bottom lines; and it had been since 2016. That was also the year Amazon first turned consistently profitable.\nThat said, Google has way more cash than Amazon - nearly double in terms of total cash, with roughly a fifth as much debt. Considering that Amazon brings in nearly twice as much revenue as Google annually (though that gap is closing), that means that Amazon has been way more willing to spend its cash on things that will grow the company - the Amazon Prime Video streaming service that is rivaling Netflix these days; a new foray into live sports with NFL broadcasts; the Amazon Echo, Amazon Web Services, etc. Google looks more like a cash hoarder. The result is that Amazon stock has grown much faster than GOOG stock in the last decade, though that has certainly changed in the last two years.\nThe guess here is that Google will start loosening its purse strings in the coming years, devoting it to new, exciting products like the long-anticipated and recently released Google Pixel Watch intended to rival the Apple Watch, a new Pixel smartphone, or perhaps Google will join Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Disney in the big-money streaming video wars (YouTube did make a splash buying the NFL broadcast rights). Regardless of what it comes up with, bet on Google spending more of its $120 billion cash stockpile soon. If it does, that could capture investors\u2019 attention the way Amazon did up until the last few years.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either of these growth stocks. If you bought both of them five, 10 or even 15 years ago, you\u2019ve made a LOT of money. But AMZN has been the better performer, at least up until recently. I think that might change in the years to come. Between its cash stockpile, untapped potential revenue streams, and cheaper valuation, I like GOOG stock to outperform AMZN in the next five years. In fact, that shift already seems to be taking place, as the last few years have shown. It could be the start of a longer-term role reversal between two of the biggest, baddest tech stocks on the block.\nFurthermore, after such extreme selling last year, both these stocks are still trading below their 2021 levels despite a furious run-up to start this year. You could buy both (or either, although I prefer GOOG); either way, an investment in GOOG stock will likely turn out quite well five years from now.\nFor a list of the stocks that actually have momentum after a tough earnings season, consider taking a trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Trader.

    "Document": "More From Forbes\nHow Overvalued Is Tesla\u2019s Stock, Really?\nThe logo of the Tesla Inc is seen on a screen of a smartphone next to a screen with an illustration ... [+] ofthe stock market. Tesla is listed in Nasdaq. The Nasdaq is the second-largest stock exchange in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo by Alexander Pohl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nDespite Tesla\u2019s\nTSLA\nstock having lost more than 60% of its value since November 2021, recent analyst reports from JPMorgan indicate that the stock would have to drop by at least 35% more from its current level to reach fundamental value. However, a behavioral analysis of the report\u2019s methodology suggests that the number might be closer to 75% than 35%.\nTwo psychological elements underlie the behavioral analysis of the report. Both were emphasized by the late psychologist Daniel Kahneman. The first is downplaying base rates, and the second is representativeness. Base rates refer to the rates at which relevant events have occurred in the past. Representativeness is the misuse of stereotypic thinking.\nBack Of The Envelope Calculation\nWhile some investors like to dig into the details of analyst reports, many do not. For those who do not, this section presents a brief back of the envelope calculation to register the point about Tesla\u2019s potential overvaluation. Readers who just want a quick sense of the issue can read this section and skip to the conclusion.\nDuring April 2024, the JPMorgan reports on Tesla estimate that at the end of 2024, Tesla\u2019s enterprise value will be $331,483 million. A key input in arriving at this value is an estimate of the minimum level of future profitability Tesla\u2019s investors would find acceptable.\nHere acceptable profitability is measured by a rate of return, the cost of capital. Actual profitability is measured by the return on invested capital. When they are equal, the firm is said to exactly earn its cost of capital.\nBillionaire Mark Cuban Issues Post Halving Bitcoin Warning Amid\nUnprecedented\nCrypto Fee Price\nChaos\nAEW Dynasty 2024 Results\nWinners And Grades As Swerve Makes History\nWho Is David Pecker\nWhy He s Testifying Against Trump In Hush Money Trial\nThe base rate issue is that in the long run, most companies do not earn more than their cost of capital. That is, return on invested capital does not exceed the cost of capital.\nIf the JPMorgan analysts expect that Tesla will exactly earn its cost of capital going forward, then there is a straightforward calculation to estimate its fundamental value at the end of 2024: Simply divide the estimate of Tesla\u2019s 2025 value of EBIT after tax, or EBI, by Tesla\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. The report also estimates Tesla\u2019s EBIT during 2025 to be $12,792 million and its WACC to be 11.8%. The result is $108,406 million, which is roughly one third of the JPMorgan estimate.\nI suggest a reason why the JPMorgan estimate of enterprise value could be three times the estimate from the simple formula: The JPMorgan analysts assume that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital going forward. Is the assumption reasonable? The evidence presented below suggests not.\nTesla\u2019s Return On Invested Capital\nPrior to 2020, Tesla\u2019s return on invested capital was negative. In 2020, it barely turned positive. However, in 2021, it rose to 14%, then to 23% in 2022 and then dropped slightly to 20% in 2023. Therefore, in the last three years, Tesla did indeed earn more than its cost of capital.\nHowever, Tesla\u2019s situation has changed. The JPMorgan analysts gave Tesla\u2019s stock a recommendation of Underweight, indicating that Tesla\u2019s deteriorating fundamentals relate to decreased demand for its vehicles, not decreased supply. The New York Times\nNYT\ndescribes how Tesla is now facing stiff competition for electric vehicles from American, Korean, Chinese and European automobile manufacturers, such as Ford, BYD, and BMW. These firms all have big EV product lines and growing sales. Indeed, during the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD briefly became the world\u2019s largest seller of EVs.\nStandard textbooks in economics and finance clearly state that for a company to earn more than its cost of capital in the long run, it must have some sustainable competitive advantage. Companies that earn more than their costs of capital attract competitors, and competition puts downward pressure on prices and profit margins. Tesla is now cutting prices and profit margins to compete with its competitors. Going forward, this decision will place significant pressure on the company\u2019s ROIC.\nReturn On Capital, Base Rates, And Representativeness\nComputing enterprise value requires a focus on the long run. Consider this question: Over the long run, what percentage of publicly traded companies earn more than Treasury bills? This is a question about a base rate.\nFinancial economist Hank Bessembinder\u2019s work provides the answer, which is 4%. Think of 4% as the base rate. Put another way, over the long run, 96% of publicly traded stocks fail to outperform the Treasury bill rate.\nAmazon\nAMZN\nand Apple\nAAPL\nearn more than Treasury bills. In May 2017, analysts at Morgan Stanley\nMS\nmade the following statement: \u201cThe bull case on Tesla is that it can become the next Amazon or Apple.\u201d The title of the report is \u201cThe Price of Ambition: Downgrade to EW.\u201d Keep in mind that the simple valuation formula refers to companies earning their cost of capital, not earning the rate on Treasury bills. So, the question for valuing Tesla becomes whether it is reasonable to expect that going forward, the firm\u2019s ROIC will match its 11.8% cost of capital. Given the base rate, the odds are against it.\nIn respect to representativeness, Amazon and Apple serve as stereotypes. Analysts and investors rely on representativeness for their judgments when they do two things. First, they view Amazon and Apple as emblematic of companies with the highest performing stocks. Second they make valuation judgements about Tesla based on their perceptions of how representative is Tesla of the class of companies having the highest performing stocks.\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Analysis\nThe analysts at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley do not use the simple valuation EBI/WACC-formula which I described above. Instead, they use a free cash flow counterpart, which applies a multiple to an estimate of a future free cash flow. For example, the JPMorgan analysts apply a multiple of 83 to their 2025-free cash flow estimate of $2,571 million for Tesla.\nAs a general matter, applying a multiple is fine, as long as the multiple is reasonable. The thing about using 83 is that it implies an expectation that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital going forward. That is why, I suggest, the JPMorgan estimate of $100 per share for Tesla\u2019s fundamental enterprise value is too high.\nIt is straightforward to ascertain the value of the multiple corresponding to any firm exactly earning its cost of capital. First, estimate the long-term growth rate for the company\u2019s free cash flow. Call this g. Compute the ratio (1+g)/(WACC-g). Now tie g to the assumption that the firm will exactly earn its cost of capital. The textbook formula for g in this case is g = retention rate x WACC. The retention rate is the ratio of a company\u2019s capital expenditures net of depreciation to the sum of its unlevered free cash flow and capex net of depreciation.\nAnalysts routinely assume values for free cash flow growth rates that are higher than the textbook formula. Moreover, these assumptions are buried in the multiples they use. If you do the math, you will discover that JPMorgan\u2019s implicit value of g is 11% per year. The textbook formula indicates that if Tesla is expected to earn its costs of capital exactly, the corresponding value of g would be 8.4%. Using 11% for g when 8.4% is warranted is a bias known as growth opportunities bias.\nUsing 8.4% will produce an estimate of enterprise value for Tesla that is in the neighborhood of what you get using the simple EBI/WACC formula. Try it.\nTesla\u2019s free cash flows were negative until 2018. Once positive, they grew quickly through 2021. In 2020, they grew at 128.6% and in 2021 at 19.7%. However, in 2022 growth turned negative at -25.5%, and in 2023 it dropped further to -175.9%.\nSentiment\nThe upshot of the Tesla\u2019s fundamental value being so far below its market price is that Tesla\u2019s price mostly reflects optimistic sentiment. On this point, the JPMorgan report establishes a December 2024 target price for Tesla\u2019s stock of $115, not $100. In this respect, the report\u2019s methodology arrives at $115 by taking a 50-50 combination of its $100 estimate of DCF-based fundamental value and a $130 estimate based on multiples such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales. The multiples approach captures market-wide sentiment, but not sentiment unique to Tesla.\nBehavioral asset pricing theory focuses on the decomposition of market prices into a fundamental component and a sentiment component. The target price approach I favor would place a lower weight on fundamental value computed using the EBI/WACC formula, a higher weight on the multiples approach, and the addition of a component to account for Tesla-specific sentiment.\nThe Tesla-specific component is important. For years, the JPMorgan analysts have assigned Tesla\u2019s stock a recommendation of Underweight. This was the case in July 2020 when Tesla\u2019s stock was trading at $1,592. At the time, the JPMorgan analysts\u2019 target price was $325, 80% below the market price. Its estimate of fundamental value per share was $295 and its multiple-based counterpart was $356. Remember, 2020 was a time when Tesla\u2019s free cash flow growth was high, and its ROIC had just turned positive. In July 2021, a year, later, Tesla\u2019s stock increased by 140%, vividly demonstrating the power of sentiment. It is a mistake to think that prices revert to fundamental value quickly, or even move in the right direction.\nGeneral Takeaways\nSentiment refers to biased reactions to changing fundamentals. The history of Tesla\u2019s stock illustrates just how important sentiment can be in the short-to-medium terms.\nAnalysts might serve the investing public better, for all stocks, not just Tesla, by structuring the valuation portions of their reports to decompose target prices into fundamental and sentiment components. In doing so, they could also be transparent about base rates for ROIC and free cash flow growth rates. Specifically, they can exercise caution about giving due weight to base rates and avoiding representativeness bias, in an effort to mitigate growth opportunity bias. Doing so just might lead market prices to more accurately reflect their corresponding fundamental values.\nI contacted Media Relations at JPMorgan to offer the firm an opportunity to respond to the points in this post. However, the firm\u2019s policy is not to comment on the methodology in analyst reports.",

However, Tesla now faces stiff competition from other EV manufacturers, leading to price cuts and pressure on profit margins. This competition challenges the assumption that Tesla will continue to earn more than its cost of capital.\n\nFinancial economist Hank Bessembinder\u2019s work shows that only 4% of publicly traded companies earn more than Treasury bills in the long run. Given this base rate, it is unlikely that Tesla will continue to outperform. Analysts often use representativeness, comparing Tesla to high-performing companies like Amazon and Apple, which can lead to biased valuations.\n\nJPMorgan and Morgan Stanley analysts use a discounted free cash flow analysis, applying a multiple to future free cash flow estimates. JPMorgan\u2019s multiple of 83 implies an expectation that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital. However, using a more conservative growth rate of 8.4% instead of 11% would produce a lower enterprise value estimate.\n\nTesla\u2019s free cash flows were negative until 2018, grew quickly through 2021, but turned negative in 2022 and 2023. The JPMorgan report sets a December 2024 target price for Tesla\u2019s stock at $115, combining a $100 estimate of fundamental value and a $130 estimate based on market sentiment. Behavioral asset pricing theory suggests that Tesla\u2019s market price reflects optimistic sentiment rather than fundamental value.\n\nIn summary, sentiment plays a significant role in Tesla\u2019s stock price. Analysts should decompose target prices into fundamental and sentiment components, be transparent about base rates, and avoid representativeness bias to provide more accurate valuations.",

This At-a-Glance document is based on the association\u2019s 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update: A Report of US and Global Data From the AHA, which is compiled annually by the AHA, the National Institutes of Health, and other collaborators. The years of data cited were the most recent available for each topic at the time the Update was written. American Heart Association Research \u2022 The AHA uses donations to fund research projects. Research applications are carefully weighed and selected by teams of scientists and healthcare professionals who volunteer for the association. \u2022 Ten investigators received Nobel Prizes for research wholly or partially supported by the AHA. \u2022 The AHA is the largest non-profit, non-governmental funder of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular research in the United States. \u2022 The AHA has funded more than $5 billion in research since 1949. Heart Disease, Stroke, and other Cardiovascular Diseases \u2022 Cardiovascular disease (CVD), listed as the underlying cause of death, accounted for 931,578 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 Heart disease and stroke claimed more lives in 2021 in the United States than all forms of cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. \u2022 Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. Between 2019 and 2020, direct and indirect costs of total CVD were $422.3 billion ($254.3 billion in direct costs and $168.0 billion in lost productivity/mortality). \u2022 In 2017 to 2020 in the United States, 59.0% of non-Hispanic Black females and 58.9% of non-Hispanic Black males had some form of CVD. This race category had the highest prevalence of CVD. \u2022 In 2021 in the United States, coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of deaths (40.3%) attributable to CVD in the United States, followed by stroke (17.5%), other CVD (17.1%), high blood pressure (13.4%), heart failure (9.1%), diseases of the arteries (2.6%). \u2022 CVD accounted for 12% of total US health expenditures in 2019 to 2020, more than any major diagnostic group. \u2022 CVD accounted for approximately 19.91 million global deaths in 2021. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. Coronary Heart Disease \u2022 CHD caused 375,476 deaths in 2021. \u2022 According to data from 2005 to 2014, the estimated annual incidence of heart attack in the United States was 605,000 new attacks and 200,000 recurrent attacks. Average age at the first heart attack was 65.6 years for males and 72.0 years for females. \u2022 Approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the United States will have a myocardial infarction. \u2022 From 2011 to 2021 in the United States, the annual death rate attributable to CHD declined 15.0% and the actual number of deaths increased 0.05%. \u2022 The estimated direct and indirect cost of heart disease, in 2019 to 2020 (average annual) was $252.2 billion in the United States. This cost includes CHD, heart failure, part of hypertensive disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary heart disease, and other or ill-defined heart diseases. Stroke \u2022 In 2021, stroke accounted for approximately 1 of every 21 deaths in the United States. \u2022 On average in 2021, someone died of stroke every 3 minutes 14 seconds in the United States. \u2022 Stroke caused 162,890 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 In 2021, the age-adjusted US stroke death rate as an underlying cause of death was 41.1 per 100,000, an increase of 8.4% from 2011, and the actual number of stroke deaths increased 26.3% during the same time period. \u2022 In 2021, there were 7.44 million deaths attributable to stroke worldwide (3.71 million deaths from ischemic stroke, 3.38 million deaths from intracerebral hemorrhage, and 0.36 million from subarachnoid hemorrhage). o Oceania and Southeast and Central Asia had the highest rates of overall stroke mortality. o Central Asia and Eastern Europe had the highest mortality rates attributable to ischemic stroke. o Intracerebral hemorrhage mortality was highest in Oceania, followed by Southeast Asia and central and eastern sub-Saharan Africa. o Mortality attributable to subarachnoid hemorrhage was highest in Oceania, followed by Andean Latin America, and Southeast and Central Asia. Sudden Cardiac Arrest \u2022 In 2021, underlying cause sudden cardiac arrest mortality in the United States was 20,114. \u2022 According to 2022 US data, the majority of adult Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA) occur at a home or residence (72.1%). Public settings (17.3%) and nursing homes (10.6%) were the second and third most common locations of adult OHCA. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. \u2022 According to 2022 US data for adult OHCA only, survival to hospital discharge was 9.3% for all EMS-treated non-traumatic OHCA cardiac arrests. Bystander witnessed adult arrests had a 14.0% survival to hospital discharge and 9-1-1 responder witnessed arrests had a 17.0% survival to hospital discharge. Heart Disease, Stroke and CVD Risk Factors The AHA gauges the cardiovascular health of the nation by tracking eight key health factors and behaviors that increase risks for heart disease and stroke. These are called \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8\u201d and the AHA measures them to track progress toward improving cardiovascular health for all Americans. Life\u2019s Essential 8 are: not-smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Here are some key facts related to these factors: Smoking \u2022 Worldwide, tobacco contributed to an estimated 7.43 million deaths in 2021. \u2022 In the United States, smoking was the leading risk factor for years of life lost to premature mortality and the third leading risk factor for years of life lived with disability or injury in 2019. \u2022 A meta-analysis of 23 prospective and 17 case-control studies of cardiovascular risks associated with secondhand smoke exposure demonstrated 18%, 23%, 23%, and 29% increased risks for total mortality, total CVD, CHD, and stroke, respectively, in those exposed to secondhand smoke. \u2022 According to the 2020 Surgeon General\u2019s report on smoking cessation, >480 000 Americans die as a result of cigarette smoking and >41 000 die of secondhand smoke exposure each year, \u22481 in 5 deaths annually. \u2022 In 2022, 16.5% of US high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco product use. Additionally, 2.0% of US high school students and 1.0% of middle school students smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. In the past 30 days, 14.1% of US high school students and 3.3% of middle school students used e-cigarettes. \u2022 In 2022, 11.5% of US adults reported cigarette use every day or some days (13.1% of males and 10.1% of females). Physical Inactivity \u2022 In 2020, the overall prevalence of meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for aerobic activity was 24.2% in US adults. \u2022 Among US high school students in 2019, 44.1% were physically active for 60 minutes or more on at least 5 days of the week. Nutrition \u2022 Using the AHA\u2019s Life\u2019s Essential 8 scoring metric, diet was among the 4 metrics with the lowest scores; the range for diet across demographic groups was 23.8 to 47.7 out of 100. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. \u2022 Among children 2 to 5 years of age, a mean diet score of 61.1 out of 100 was observed. The score for children 12 to 19 years of age was 28.5 out of 100. \u2022 Using 2019 data, an estimated 7.9 million deaths and 188 million disability-adjusted life years were attributable to dietary risks. The leading dietary risk factors were high sodium intake, low whole grain intake, and low legume intake. Overweight/Obesity \u2022 In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among adults from 2017 to 2020 was 41.8% in males and 41.8% in females. \u2022 The age-adjusted prevalence of severe obesity in adults in the United States in 2017 to 2020 was 6.6% in males and 11.7% in females. \u2022 Worldwide, high body mass index was attributed to 3.69 million deaths in 2021, a change of 46.7% compared with 2010. \u2022 According to the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study, age-standardized mortality rates attributable to high body mass index were lowest in high-income Asia Pacific and highest in southern sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, and Oceania. Cholesterol \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 86.4 million, or 34.7% of US adults had total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020 about 24.7 million, or 10.0% of US adults had total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 63.1 million, or 25.5% of US adults had high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (130 mg/dL or higher). \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 41.3 million, or 16.9% of US adults had low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL). \u2022 Globally in 2021 there were 3.72 million deaths attributable to high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a 19.8% change from 2010. Sleep \u2022 Analysis of 2020 data indicates that the proportion of US adults reporting insufficient sleep (<7 hours) was 32.8% (females, 32.2%; males, 33.4%). Prevalence of reporting insufficient sleep was lowest among older adults (>65 years of age) with 27.3% of females and 24.7% of males in this older group reporting <7 hours of sleep per night. \u2022 Based on 2020 data, 43.7% of US adults self-report they wake up feeling well rested on some days or never (46.9% of females; 40.4% of males). \u2022 Based on 2020 data, during the last 30 days, 24.3% of US adults responded that they had trouble falling or staying asleep on most or all days (27.8% female; 20.6% male). 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

Unauthorized use prohibited. Diabetes \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, an estimated 29.3 million (10.6%) US adults had diagnosed diabetes. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, an estimated 9.7 million (3.5%) US adults had undiagnosed diabetes. Additionally, 115.9 million (46.4%) US adults had prediabetes. \u2022 In 2021, 103,294 US deaths were attributed to diabetes. \u2022 In 2021, an estimated 1.70 million deaths were attributed to diabetes globally. This represents an age-standardized mortality rate of 19.93 per 100,000. High Blood Pressure (HBP) \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 122.4 million (46.7%) US adults had hypertension. \u2022 In 2021, there were 124,508 US deaths primarily attributable to HBP. \u2022 In 2021, the age-adjusted US death rate primarily attributable to HBP was 31.3 per 100,000.

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

These laboratories report the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza and other respiratory virus detections and isolations on a weekly basis. The overall percentage of influenza detections in clinical sentinel laboratories during Week 11 was 5.0% compared to 5.2% during Week 10 (Figure 1). Additional details, including influenza typing and subtyping information from public health laboratories can be found in Figures 1 and 2 and Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1.

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6). The percentage of deaths coded as influenza during Week 11 was 0.0% compared to 0.1% during Week 10 (Figure 7).\n4 24 1 24 104 1 25 166 28 34 520 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Deaths ICU Non-ICU Percentage of Influenza Hospitalizations Severity of Hospitalization <18 years 18-49 years 50-64 years \u226565 years 9 of 20 Figure 6.

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). Methods used to identify pediatric influenza-coded deaths on death certificates differ from those used to identify the influenza-associated pediatric deaths presented below, which require laboratory confirmation of influenza, and might not include the same individuals. One laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated death in a child <18 years of age was reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received nine reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths among children <18 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season. Influenza-associated Outbreaks Two laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks were reported during Week 11. To date, 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported to CDPH during the 2023\u20132024 season. One previously reported outbreak was removed because it did not meet the outbreak definition. Figure 9.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10.

RSV-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are likely to be an underestimate of all RSV-associated deaths. During Week 11, ten RSV-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 295 RSV-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 15). The percentage of deaths coded as RSV during Week 11 was 0.11% compared to 0.19% during Week 10 (Figure 16). Figure 15.

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). No laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated deaths in children <5 years of age were reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received three reports of laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated deaths among children <5 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season.

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive.

    "Summarized_Document": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",

This guide will teach you all you need to know about ACT scores!\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIf you want to evaluate how you compare to other test-takers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach you everything you need to know about your scores, including average ACT scores, percentiles, highest ACT scores possible, and much more.\nAverage ACT Scores (2024)\nACT scores range from 1 to 36 in each category (except for writing, out of 12). The average of your four scores determines your ACT composite score. According to ACT Score National Ranks, the average score in each category is:\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to know how the ACT is scored. \u00c2\u00a0First, the number of questions you got correct in each section is counted and converted to scale scores.\nThe average ACT score is 19.9. These rankings are based on almost 4.5 million \u00e2\u0080\u009cACT-tested high school graduates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe ACT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website also released score information for students who decided to take the optional writing test, which contributes to an English Language Arts score (ELA). The average writing and ELA scores are 6.2 and 18.3, respectively. Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test.\nAverage ACT Scores by State\nBelow is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAverage ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US\nLet's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States.\nHighest Possible ACT Score\u00c2\u00a0\nThe highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test.\nACT Scores By Percentile\u00c2\u00a0\nACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nSource: ACT.org\nBased on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive).\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile.\u00c2\u00a0\nOverall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nAre you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies.\nFAQs\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs!\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good?\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application.\u00c2\u00a0\n4. What Is a Low ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nLike what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to?\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce your ACT score is released, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant!\u00c2\u00a0\n6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT?\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant.\n7. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lowest Possible ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe lowest ACT score possible is 1.\n8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section?\nThe average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc.\n9. What is The Average Science ACT Score?\nThe average science ACT score is 20.\nFinal Thoughts\nNow that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.\u00c2\u00a0 A good way to go about it is to test your skills with our Free ACT Practice Questions Pop Quiz.

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.  If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below.  The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA.  There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.\u00a0For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\nI have an Economics degree from\u00a0UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at\u00a0BNEF\u00a0and continue to work as a strategy consultant at\u00a0Maneas. \u00a0I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\nHello Lindsay,\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

    "Document": "\n\t\t\t\t\t  Freight rates: Trucking rates per mile 2024\t\t\t\t\t\nIf you own a trucking business, then you\u2019re probably always on the go. But as most small business owners know, there are times where you need to stop and make sure that your business is bringing in the revenue it should be.\nOur research indicates that figuring out the best trucking rates per mile is the key to making sure that your business remains profitable, but it can also be a complex process as rates are constantly changing.\nBefore getting into the details on trucking rates per mile 2024, it\u2019s important to understand what goes into determining freight truck rates.\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll find out what current trucking rates per mile are and get a refresher on the industry terms to remember as you navigate truck rates.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nHow to calculate trucking  freight rates\nThe trucking rates can be calculated by multiplying your trucking rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points.\nTotal trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles)\nLike other trades jobs, there is a lot that goes into determining the best trucking rate per mile for your business.\nOur findings show that not only do you have to constantly monitor your fuel spend as well as supply and demand, but you also have to take into account your fixed costs.\nBut let\u2019s start with the basics for truck rates per mile.\nA truck freight rate is a price a shipper or broker will pay you, the carrier, to haul a load. The concept is simple, but our research indicates that trucking rates per mile can vary significantly depending on the time of year and current fuel prices.\nWhich can make knowing the national average trucking cost per mile feel like a black box.\nTrucking freight rates are calculated on a per mile basis. Therefore, the most important number when it comes to calculating truck rates is the number of miles between your starting point and the destination.\nBased on our observations, having the average rate per mile for trucking and accurate information about trucking freight rates is essential to properly pricing trips and negotiating rates with your customers.\nBe aware, however, that calculating the overall freight rate depends on various other factors. Below, you\u2019ll find what you need to consider when calculating trucking rates.\nFactor #1: Distance of travel\nImage credit: Nelson Gono via Unsplash\nWhether you\u2019re transporting locally or looking at over the road trucking rates, the distance between destinations is an important part of determining trucking rates per mile.\nYou want to ensure that you have the right mileage from the beginning to avoid any surprises along the way and get the correct per mile trucking rates.\nDouble-check that your driver will not be required to make any long detours because of road closures. Otherwise, you risk job profitability, timing, and changes to the rate per mile for truck drivers.\nFactor #2: The weight of the shipment\nAfter the distance, our findings show that the weight of the shipment is one of the most significant factors for the cost of trucking per mile. It is important to manage the overall weight load for your fleet to control costs and determine your per mile rate for trucking.\nTo be successful at this, you\u2019ll need to consider variables like heavy haul rates per mile, FTL trucking rates, number of passengers, etc.\nOtherwise, you stand to incorrectly answer \u201cWhat is the average freight cost per mile?\u201d.\nWhen it comes to your average per mile rate for freight, it\u2019s best to be on the safe side and start with higher rates per mile for trucking to allow your customer to negotiate while still ensuring revenue for your business.\nWith this approach, your average haulage cost per mile is sure to bring a profit to your business.\nFactor #3: Shipment density\nThe shipment density is another factor that will determine how much room a shipment will take up in your truck and, in turn, your trucking per mile rates.\nDrawing from our experience, once you know the weight of the shipment, calculating the shipment density is simple. All you have to do is divide the cargo weight by its cubic feet.\nFactor #4: Freight classification\nA question that often goes unanswered is \u201cWhat is the average freight rate per mile?\u201d.\nAnd the question makes sense based on our observations given the number of important industry standards to keep up with for freight classification.\nThe National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) has defined 18 classes of shipments that affect freight rates per mile.\nFreight classification is determined by factors such as:\nHaving a thorough knowledge of how to use these factors to calculate trucking rates per mile will ensure that your business remains competitive and profitable.\nOur findings show that most trucking companies charge customers per mile based on factors like:\nYou need to strike a good balance when setting your rates \u2013 setting a low rate may cause you to lose money, while setting a high rate may turn customers away toward cheaper companies.\nA good rule of thumb to stay competitive rate-wise is to keep an eye on both national and local trucking rates. And based on our observations, providing a fair rate with excellent service is the key to getting (and retaining) more customers.\nAt the time of writing, the national average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile. However, this is just a national average, which means your area may have higher or lower rates.\nTo set a fair price for your flatbed truck services, you need to consider things like:\nThrough our practical knowledge, setting a fair per-mile rate means you can pay truckers a fair wage, keep the clients happy, and still a profit.\nAlthough these are the main takeaways on how to calculate trucking rates, you want to ensure that you have the basic industry knowledge to determine other factors that may influence your truck rates.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some key trucking terms, beyond freight trucking rates, to set you up for success.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nThe terms in trucking you need to know\nKeeping up to date with all of the basic trucking terms is an important factor in knowing how to calculate trucking rates and freight cost per mile.\nFirst things first, there are several types of freight trucks, and they are each ideal to haul different cargo. Your freight type will determine your trucking rates per mile as freight costs per mile steeply influence your fuel spend.\nDifferent types of freight trucks include:\nHere are some other industry terms that play a factor in the national trucking rate per mile and that will help you understand what the going rate for freight per mile is.\nConsignor\nThe consignor is the party that is shipping the product you\u2019re transporting. They are also known as the seller and are your customer.\nThe consignor can be:\nThe ownership of the products stays with the consignor until the consignee pays them in full. Still, our investigation demonstrated that that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the liability stays with them.\nConsignee\nA consignee is a recipient of the products being shipped. You can think of them as the buyer, and they can be an individual or a company.\nThe consignee must be physically present to accept the shipment from the consignor unless specifically stated otherwise in the bill of lading.\nCarrier\nImage credit: Quintin Gellar via Pexels\nYour role in the shipping process will be that of the carrier. The carrier is the party in charge of delivering the products to their destination.\nAs a carrier, you\u2019re responsible for receiving the bill of lading and safely transporting items to the consignee.\nBill of lading (BOL)\nThe consignor sends the goods to you, the freight carrier, to ship them to the consignee. However, the ownership of the freight doesn\u2019t legally change until the recipient of the goods signs the bill of lading (BOL).\nA BOL is a document required in the shipping process that involves all parties: the consignor, consignee, and carrier. The consignor and consignee each get a copy of the BOL, and then there is usually a third copy for the bank.\nThe BOL includes relevant details necessary to ship the product and invoice the transaction correctly once it is completed.\nIt includes the following information:\nFree on board point (FOB)\nFree on board (FOB), also known as freight on board, is a term used to indicate whether the buyer or the seller is liable for goods that are lost, damaged, or destroyed during shipping.\nThe FOB shipping point indicates that the title and responsibility of goods transfer from the seller to the buyer when the goods are placed on your delivery vehicle.\nOn the other hand, a FOB destination means that the seller is responsible for the goods until the goods are delivered to the buyer.\nLoss and damage\nAs a carrier, you may have to deal with loss or damage claims from time to time.\nA damage claim involves visible damage to either the goods or the storage container that the goods are in. The damage should be noted on the bill of lading or another delivery document.\nA loss claim is when a shipment is not delivered or when it shows that it was delivered, but the recipient hasn\u2019t received it. This can be due to typography errors in the bill of lading causing the shipment to go to the wrong address.\nFull truckload shipping (FTL)\nFull truckload shipping (FTL) applies to a shipment that takes up an entire trailer. This is a key price variable as it affects the cost of freight per mile.\nWhen it comes to FTL freight rates factors, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s the smallest truck in your fleet or the largest as FTL applies as long as you use up your entire space. Typically, FTL freight will exceed 15,000 pounds.\nThe full truck load cost per mile typically costs a higher rate per mile since your truck is at full capacity.\nLess than truckload (LTL)\nA less than truckload shipment (LTL) doesn\u2019t take up an entire trailer but may need to move between vehicles during the shipping process. For this reason, LTL rates per mile aren\u2019t always standard across jobs and will affect your average LTL cost per mile.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll need to charge your customers a different rate than the average truckload rate per mile if you\u2019re at less than a truckload.\nTrucking rates per mile for LTL will vary depending on how far your company will be taking the shipment.\nLoad rates for trucks\nLoad rates or freight rates are what you charge for a truck to deliver cargo from one place to another.\nLoad rates are typically paid per mile and can be influenced by factors such as:\nAdditional services like warehouse storage, loading and unloading, and automotive insurance may be included in calculating a customer\u2019s load rates.\nOur findings show that load rates also vary depending on the type of cargo being carried because different cargo may need different types of trucks to transport.\nDrayage\nDrayage is a term that involves shipping goods at a short distance via ground freight. Basically, it is the process of moving a large container to your truck.\nBased on our firsthand experience, this may be an extra cost that you have to consider when giving your customer an estimate of the total cost of your services.\nPallets\nPallets are portable platforms used to package items for freight shipping. Pallets come in different sizes, but the most common size that you\u2019ll find is the standard 40 x 48 size to ship items.\nPallets not only make loading and unloading items easier, but they also allow you to maximize space in your truck. This may reduce your total cost and allow you to provide more competitive trucking rates per mile.\nStop keeping unit (SKU)\nAn SKU (Stock keeping unit) is a service identification code. They\u2019re usually displayed alphanumerically or as a barcode.\nSKUs help track products in inventory as they contain all factors required to identify an item, such as:\nHundredweight (CWT)\nA hundredweight, also known as a CWT, is a unit of measurement. In North America, a hundredweight refers to 100 pounds, whereas the British consider a hundredweight to be 112 pounds.\nIn the past, packages that take up less than an entire truckload were measured by CWTs, but it is not common to measure packages by CWT today. Measuring by pounds or kilograms is now the standard.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nIn order to continue to offer competitive trucking rates per mile, you need to know how much do trucking companies charge per mile. Cost per mile is influenced by factors such as:\nFinancing is also a cost that may influence the cost per mile. The cost of financing trucks and trailers ranges from 0% to 30% of revenue.\nAs of July 2021, trucking rates per mile remain steady. Here are the current rates for the most popular freight truck types:\nFuel prices have been steadily increasing over the past year and are a huge variable in knowing how to calculate transportation rates.\nThe national diesel price was sitting at $3.34 per gallon, with a $0.05 increase from June 2021 to July 2021. However, in 2024 prices have increased greatly with high rates of fluctuation when it comes to price and supply availability.\nAverage rate per mile for owner-operators\nIn contrast to company drivers, owner-operators are truckers who own or lease their own trucks. These people usually work with a trucking company to get back-office support and find trucking jobs.\nOwner-operators generally earn about 70 to 80 percent of the loads they take. For example, if flatbed truck transport is $3.14 per mile, the owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. If they\u2019re out on the road often, they may earn up to $156,000 annually.\nWhere does the rest of your per-mile rate go? The remaining 20 to 30 percent goes to your trucking company. An owner-operator at a trucking company benefits from access to cargo jobs, in-house mechanics, and gas station location optimization.\nBeing an owner-operator is a great way to earn more money, but it also means you will be dealing with the stress and finances largely on your own.\nFor example, you\u2019ll have to shoulder truck maintenance, health insurance, and other business expenses.\nIf you\u2019re not prepared to take on the added risk and costs, becoming a company trucker is always viable.\nTrucking rates per mile 2024 FAQs:\nHere are the top questions truckers have in 2024:\nDo trucking companies pay for empty miles?\nEmpty miles, also known as non-revenue or deadhead miles, are miles garnered by the truck when it isn\u2019t earning any revenue.\nBased on our observations, this happens when there\u2019s a load to the destination but no load back. Empty miles range from 33 \u2013 40% of total miles driven, making them very wasteful for your trucking business.\nTo avoid empty miles, try to minimize any unnecessary movement of goods and improve your scheduling so that your trucks are carrying a load as often as possible.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid an empty mile, it\u2019s best to add a portion of it to your rate per mile trucking costs.\nWhat is a good rate per mile for trucking companies to charge?\nAfter putting it to the test, it is difficult to determine an average rate for trucking rates per mile, but if you keep up with industry news, you\u2019ll always have a good idea of average trucking rates.\nTo answer your question on what is the going rate per mile for trucking \u2014 current trucking rates per mile 2024 averages are:\nKeep in mind that these are just average per mile trucking rates, and your business may profit from a different rate. Based on our observations, providing the lowest rates may not be enough to bring your revenue, but a rate that\u2019s too high may price you out of the competition.\nThe same goes for how much you offer your drivers. As per our expertise, you need to know what is the average rate per mile for truck drivers in your area so you can be fair as well as competitive when it comes to wages.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nThe average going rates for trucking per mile are:\nMany things influence trucking freight rates. Some key factors include:\nWhy are trucking rates so low?\nOur findings show that recent trucking rates are low because of a larger supply compared to the available demand.\nWhen the pandemic began, people needed more things shipped, and the for-hire trucking market soared. Trucking companies started large recruiting drives, and many people decided to start trucking businesses of their own.\nBut now that the volume of shipments is falling to pre-pandemic levels, there are simply too many truckers and not enough demand for shipments by truck. As the laws of supply and demand dictate, an abundance of supply means that prices are going to fall.\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s thrown a wrench in the trucking industry. Recent global developments, such as the war in Ukraine raising fuel prices and a COVID resurgence in China\u2019s export centers causing commodity prices to rise, have made it harder for truckers to make a profit.\nThat said, the decreased demand for consumer goods doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad for truckers. While consumer goods shipments are down, 70-80% of freight consists of manufactured goods, and manufacturing companies are still willing to pay for truck deliveries.\nHow much do owner-operators make per mile?\nOwner-operators generally make 70 to 80% of their load per mile.\nIf we take flatbed rates as an example, a flatbed truck owner-operator stands to make up to $2.51 per mile out of the $3.14 per mile average rate.\nThe rest of the money goes to the trucking company to pay for benefits such as:\nThis is in contrast to company drivers, who may only get 38 to 52 cents per mile with the same load. However, the larger cut that owner-operators get comes with extra risks.\nAlthough they get benefits from their trucking company, owner-operators are still independent contractors who need to do everything themselves.\nWhile owner-operators stand to gain more money, they also need to set aside more cash for life and automotive insurance, fuel and maintenance, and taxes.\nBecause of this, owner-operators are more likely to be experienced truckers. Typically, those who have worked as company drivers for several years want more freedom and the chance to make their own decisions.\nIf you\u2019re a new trucker or are simply averse to taking more risks and responsibilities, you can become a company driver first to gain more experience and confidence.\nHow much does a freight broker charge per load?\nFreight brokers usually charge around 25-35% of the load.\nA freight broker is a middleman between a shipper and the carrier. They take the shipment from the customer and contact a carrier fleet to take the shipment to its destination.\nShippers like working with freight brokers because the broker deals with everything related to the carriers, becoming the single point of contact for updates. On the other side, carriers also like working with freight brokers because they can optimize routes and give the truckers multiple shipments to reduce deadhead miles.\nWhy trucking rates are important\nYour number one goal is to have a profitable trucking business, and keeping up with average trucking rates per mile is the best way to ensure that your business continues to grow. The key to this is having the right cost per mile trucking, so you win jobs and turn a profit.\nHopefully, you\u2019ve learned everything from what is the average rate per mile for hauling freight to standard truck shipping rates per mile in this article.\nTo recap, the truck rates you use for your business can be influenced by the:\nBy becoming an expert on what is the average trucking rate per mile and keeping up with industry trends, you\u2019ll be able to offer competitive prices and attract more customers, meaning more revenue.\nImage credit: Zetong Li via\u00a0Unsplash\nStreamline your business with Method\nStart your free trial \u2014 no credit card, no contract.\nFeatures\nCompany\n\nResources\nSupport\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Method Integration.

This guide provides insights into current trucking rates per mile and essential industry terms.\n\nHow to calculate trucking freight rates\n\nTrucking rates are calculated by multiplying the rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points. The total trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles). Factors influencing trucking rates include distance, weight of the shipment, shipment density, and freight classification.\n\nKey factors in calculating trucking rates:\n\n1. Distance of travel: Ensure accurate mileage to avoid surprises and maintain profitability.\n2. Weight of the shipment: Manage overall weight load to control costs.\n3. Shipment density: Calculate by dividing cargo weight by its cubic feet.\n4. Freight classification: The NMFTA defines 18 classes of shipments affecting rates.\n\nTrucking companies charge customers per mile based on these factors. National average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile, but rates vary by area. Setting a fair per-mile rate ensures fair wages for truckers, happy clients, and profitability.\n\nIndustry terms to know:\n\n- Consignor: The party shipping the product.\n- Consignee: The recipient of the products.\n- Carrier: The party delivering the products.\n- Bill of lading (BOL): A document required in the shipping process.\n- Free on board point (FOB): Indicates liability for goods during shipping.\n- Loss and damage: Claims for visible damage or undelivered shipments.\n- Full truckload shipping (FTL): A shipment that takes up an entire trailer.\n- Less than truckload (LTL): A shipment that doesn't take up an entire trailer.\n- Load rates: Charges for delivering cargo, influenced by various factors.\n- Drayage: Shipping goods a short distance via ground freight.\n- Pallets: Portable platforms for packaging items for freight shipping.\n- Stop keeping unit (SKU): A service identification code for tracking products.\n- Hundredweight (CWT): A unit of measurement (100 pounds in North America).\n\nCurrent trucking rates per mile (2024 averages):\n\n- Flatbed: $3.14 per mile\n- Reefer: $3.19 per mile\n- Dry van: $2.50 per mile\n\nOwner-operators generally earn 70-80% of the load per mile. For example, with flatbed rates at $3.14 per mile, an owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. The remaining 20-30% goes to the trucking company for benefits like access to cargo jobs and in-house mechanics.\n\nTrucking rates are influenced by factors such as fuel prices, supply and demand, and global developments. Keeping up with industry trends and average rates ensures competitive pricing and profitability for your trucking business.",

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.  If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below.  The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA.  There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.\u00a0For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\nI have an Economics degree from\u00a0UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at\u00a0BNEF\u00a0and continue to work as a strategy consultant at\u00a0Maneas. \u00a0I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\nHello Lindsay,\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

But as most small business owners know, there are times where you need to stop and make sure that your business is bringing in the revenue it should be.\nOur research indicates that figuring out the best trucking rates per mile is the key to making sure that your business remains profitable, but it can also be a complex process as rates are constantly changing.\nBefore getting into the details on trucking rates per mile 2024, it\u2019s important to understand what goes into determining freight truck rates.\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll find out what current trucking rates per mile are and get a refresher on the industry terms to remember as you navigate truck rates.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nHow to calculate trucking  freight rates\nThe trucking rates can be calculated by multiplying your trucking rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points.\nTotal trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles)\nLike other trades jobs, there is a lot that goes into determining the best trucking rate per mile for your business.\nOur findings show that not only do you have to constantly monitor your fuel spend as well as supply and demand, but you also have to take into account your fixed costs.\nBut let\u2019s start with the basics for truck rates per mile.\nA truck freight rate is a price a shipper or broker will pay you, the carrier, to haul a load. The concept is simple, but our research indicates that trucking rates per mile can vary significantly depending on the time of year and current fuel prices.\nWhich can make knowing the national average trucking cost per mile feel like a black box.\nTrucking freight rates are calculated on a per mile basis. Therefore, the most important number when it comes to calculating truck rates is the number of miles between your starting point and the destination.\nBased on our observations, having the average rate per mile for trucking and accurate information about trucking freight rates is essential to properly pricing trips and negotiating rates with your customers.\nBe aware, however, that calculating the overall freight rate depends on various other factors. Below, you\u2019ll find what you need to consider when calculating trucking rates.\nFactor #1: Distance of travel\nImage credit: Nelson Gono via Unsplash\nWhether you\u2019re transporting locally or looking at over the road trucking rates, the distance between destinations is an important part of determining trucking rates per mile.\nYou want to ensure that you have the right mileage from the beginning to avoid any surprises along the way and get the correct per mile trucking rates.\nDouble-check that your driver will not be required to make any long detours because of road closures. Otherwise, you risk job profitability, timing, and changes to the rate per mile for truck drivers.\nFactor #2: The weight of the shipment\nAfter the distance, our findings show that the weight of the shipment is one of the most significant factors for the cost of trucking per mile. It is important to manage the overall weight load for your fleet to control costs and determine your per mile rate for trucking.\nTo be successful at this, you\u2019ll need to consider variables like heavy haul rates per mile, FTL trucking rates, number of passengers, etc.\nOtherwise, you stand to incorrectly answer \u201cWhat is the average freight cost per mile?\u201d.\nWhen it comes to your average per mile rate for freight, it\u2019s best to be on the safe side and start with higher rates per mile for trucking to allow your customer to negotiate while still ensuring revenue for your business.\nWith this approach, your average haulage cost per mile is sure to bring a profit to your business.\nFactor #3: Shipment density\nThe shipment density is another factor that will determine how much room a shipment will take up in your truck and, in turn, your trucking per mile rates.\nDrawing from our experience, once you know the weight of the shipment, calculating the shipment density is simple. All you have to do is divide the cargo weight by its cubic feet.\nFactor #4: Freight classification\nA question that often goes unanswered is \u201cWhat is the average freight rate per mile?\u201d.\nAnd the question makes sense based on our observations given the number of important industry standards to keep up with for freight classification.\nThe National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) has defined 18 classes of shipments that affect freight rates per mile.\nFreight classification is determined by factors such as:\nHaving a thorough knowledge of how to use these factors to calculate trucking rates per mile will ensure that your business remains competitive and profitable.\nOur findings show that most trucking companies charge customers per mile based on factors like:\nYou need to strike a good balance when setting your rates \u2013 setting a low rate may cause you to lose money, while setting a high rate may turn customers away toward cheaper companies.\nA good rule of thumb to stay competitive rate-wise is to keep an eye on both national and local trucking rates. And based on our observations, providing a fair rate with excellent service is the key to getting (and retaining) more customers.\nAt the time of writing, the national average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile. However, this is just a national average, which means your area may have higher or lower rates.\nTo set a fair price for your flatbed truck services, you need to consider things like:\nThrough our practical knowledge, setting a fair per-mile rate means you can pay truckers a fair wage, keep the clients happy, and still a profit.\nAlthough these are the main takeaways on how to calculate trucking rates, you want to ensure that you have the basic industry knowledge to determine other factors that may influence your truck rates.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some key trucking terms, beyond freight trucking rates, to set you up for success.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nThe terms in trucking you need to know\nKeeping up to date with all of the basic trucking terms is an important factor in knowing how to calculate trucking rates and freight cost per mile.\nFirst things first, there are several types of freight trucks, and they are each ideal to haul different cargo. Your freight type will determine your trucking rates per mile as freight costs per mile steeply influence your fuel spend.\nDifferent types of freight trucks include:\nHere are some other industry terms that play a factor in the national trucking rate per mile and that will help you understand what the going rate for freight per mile is.\nConsignor\nThe consignor is the party that is shipping the product you\u2019re transporting. They are also known as the seller and are your customer.\nThe consignor can be:\nThe ownership of the products stays with the consignor until the consignee pays them in full. Still, our investigation demonstrated that that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the liability stays with them.\nConsignee\nA consignee is a recipient of the products being shipped. You can think of them as the buyer, and they can be an individual or a company.\nThe consignee must be physically present to accept the shipment from the consignor unless specifically stated otherwise in the bill of lading.\nCarrier\nImage credit: Quintin Gellar via Pexels\nYour role in the shipping process will be that of the carrier. The carrier is the party in charge of delivering the products to their destination.\nAs a carrier, you\u2019re responsible for receiving the bill of lading and safely transporting items to the consignee.\nBill of lading (BOL)\nThe consignor sends the goods to you, the freight carrier, to ship them to the consignee. However, the ownership of the freight doesn\u2019t legally change until the recipient of the goods signs the bill of lading (BOL).\nA BOL is a document required in the shipping process that involves all parties: the consignor, consignee, and carrier. The consignor and consignee each get a copy of the BOL, and then there is usually a third copy for the bank.\nThe BOL includes relevant details necessary to ship the product and invoice the transaction correctly once it is completed.\nIt includes the following information:\nFree on board point (FOB)\nFree on board (FOB), also known as freight on board, is a term used to indicate whether the buyer or the seller is liable for goods that are lost, damaged, or destroyed during shipping.\nThe FOB shipping point indicates that the title and responsibility of goods transfer from the seller to the buyer when the goods are placed on your delivery vehicle.\nOn the other hand, a FOB destination means that the seller is responsible for the goods until the goods are delivered to the buyer.\nLoss and damage\nAs a carrier, you may have to deal with loss or damage claims from time to time.\nA damage claim involves visible damage to either the goods or the storage container that the goods are in. The damage should be noted on the bill of lading or another delivery document.\nA loss claim is when a shipment is not delivered or when it shows that it was delivered, but the recipient hasn\u2019t received it. This can be due to typography errors in the bill of lading causing the shipment to go to the wrong address.\nFull truckload shipping (FTL)\nFull truckload shipping (FTL) applies to a shipment that takes up an entire trailer. This is a key price variable as it affects the cost of freight per mile.\nWhen it comes to FTL freight rates factors, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s the smallest truck in your fleet or the largest as FTL applies as long as you use up your entire space. Typically, FTL freight will exceed 15,000 pounds.\nThe full truck load cost per mile typically costs a higher rate per mile since your truck is at full capacity.\nLess than truckload (LTL)\nA less than truckload shipment (LTL) doesn\u2019t take up an entire trailer but may need to move between vehicles during the shipping process. For this reason, LTL rates per mile aren\u2019t always standard across jobs and will affect your average LTL cost per mile.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll need to charge your customers a different rate than the average truckload rate per mile if you\u2019re at less than a truckload.\nTrucking rates per mile for LTL will vary depending on how far your company will be taking the shipment.\nLoad rates for trucks\nLoad rates or freight rates are what you charge for a truck to deliver cargo from one place to another.\nLoad rates are typically paid per mile and can be influenced by factors such as:\nAdditional services like warehouse storage, loading and unloading, and automotive insurance may be included in calculating a customer\u2019s load rates.\nOur findings show that load rates also vary depending on the type of cargo being carried because different cargo may need different types of trucks to transport.\nDrayage\nDrayage is a term that involves shipping goods at a short distance via ground freight. Basically, it is the process of moving a large container to your truck.\nBased on our firsthand experience, this may be an extra cost that you have to consider when giving your customer an estimate of the total cost of your services.\nPallets\nPallets are portable platforms used to package items for freight shipping. Pallets come in different sizes, but the most common size that you\u2019ll find is the standard 40 x 48 size to ship items.\nPallets not only make loading and unloading items easier, but they also allow you to maximize space in your truck. This may reduce your total cost and allow you to provide more competitive trucking rates per mile.\nStop keeping unit (SKU)\nAn SKU (Stock keeping unit) is a service identification code. They\u2019re usually displayed alphanumerically or as a barcode.\nSKUs help track products in inventory as they contain all factors required to identify an item, such as:\nHundredweight (CWT)\nA hundredweight, also known as a CWT, is a unit of measurement. In North America, a hundredweight refers to 100 pounds, whereas the British consider a hundredweight to be 112 pounds.\nIn the past, packages that take up less than an entire truckload were measured by CWTs, but it is not common to measure packages by CWT today. Measuring by pounds or kilograms is now the standard.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nIn order to continue to offer competitive trucking rates per mile, you need to know how much do trucking companies charge per mile. Cost per mile is influenced by factors such as:\nFinancing is also a cost that may influence the cost per mile. The cost of financing trucks and trailers ranges from 0% to 30% of revenue.\nAs of July 2021, trucking rates per mile remain steady. Here are the current rates for the most popular freight truck types:\nFuel prices have been steadily increasing over the past year and are a huge variable in knowing how to calculate transportation rates.\nThe national diesel price was sitting at $3.34 per gallon, with a $0.05 increase from June 2021 to July 2021. However, in 2024 prices have increased greatly with high rates of fluctuation when it comes to price and supply availability.\nAverage rate per mile for owner-operators\nIn contrast to company drivers, owner-operators are truckers who own or lease their own trucks. These people usually work with a trucking company to get back-office support and find trucking jobs.\nOwner-operators generally earn about 70 to 80 percent of the loads they take. For example, if flatbed truck transport is $3.14 per mile, the owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. If they\u2019re out on the road often, they may earn up to $156,000 annually.\nWhere does the rest of your per-mile rate go? The remaining 20 to 30 percent goes to your trucking company. An owner-operator at a trucking company benefits from access to cargo jobs, in-house mechanics, and gas station location optimization.\nBeing an owner-operator is a great way to earn more money, but it also means you will be dealing with the stress and finances largely on your own.\nFor example, you\u2019ll have to shoulder truck maintenance, health insurance, and other business expenses.\nIf you\u2019re not prepared to take on the added risk and costs, becoming a company trucker is always viable.\nTrucking rates per mile 2024 FAQs:\nHere are the top questions truckers have in 2024:\nDo trucking companies pay for empty miles?\nEmpty miles, also known as non-revenue or deadhead miles, are miles garnered by the truck when it isn\u2019t earning any revenue.\nBased on our observations, this happens when there\u2019s a load to the destination but no load back. Empty miles range from 33 \u2013 40% of total miles driven, making them very wasteful for your trucking business.\nTo avoid empty miles, try to minimize any unnecessary movement of goods and improve your scheduling so that your trucks are carrying a load as often as possible.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid an empty mile, it\u2019s best to add a portion of it to your rate per mile trucking costs.\nWhat is a good rate per mile for trucking companies to charge?\nAfter putting it to the test, it is difficult to determine an average rate for trucking rates per mile, but if you keep up with industry news, you\u2019ll always have a good idea of average trucking rates.\nTo answer your question on what is the going rate per mile for trucking \u2014 current trucking rates per mile 2024 averages are:\nKeep in mind that these are just average per mile trucking rates, and your business may profit from a different rate. Based on our observations, providing the lowest rates may not be enough to bring your revenue, but a rate that\u2019s too high may price you out of the competition.\nThe same goes for how much you offer your drivers. As per our expertise, you need to know what is the average rate per mile for truck drivers in your area so you can be fair as well as competitive when it comes to wages.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nThe average going rates for trucking per mile are:\nMany things influence trucking freight rates. Some key factors include:\nWhy are trucking rates so low?\nOur findings show that recent trucking rates are low because of a larger supply compared to the available demand.\nWhen the pandemic began, people needed more things shipped, and the for-hire trucking market soared. Trucking companies started large recruiting drives, and many people decided to start trucking businesses of their own.\nBut now that the volume of shipments is falling to pre-pandemic levels, there are simply too many truckers and not enough demand for shipments by truck. As the laws of supply and demand dictate, an abundance of supply means that prices are going to fall.\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s thrown a wrench in the trucking industry. Recent global developments, such as the war in Ukraine raising fuel prices and a COVID resurgence in China\u2019s export centers causing commodity prices to rise, have made it harder for truckers to make a profit.\nThat said, the decreased demand for consumer goods doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad for truckers. While consumer goods shipments are down, 70-80% of freight consists of manufactured goods, and manufacturing companies are still willing to pay for truck deliveries.\nHow much do owner-operators make per mile?\nOwner-operators generally make 70 to 80% of their load per mile.\nIf we take flatbed rates as an example, a flatbed truck owner-operator stands to make up to $2.51 per mile out of the $3.14 per mile average rate.\nThe rest of the money goes to the trucking company to pay for benefits such as:\nThis is in contrast to company drivers, who may only get 38 to 52 cents per mile with the same load. However, the larger cut that owner-operators get comes with extra risks.\nAlthough they get benefits from their trucking company, owner-operators are still independent contractors who need to do everything themselves.\nWhile owner-operators stand to gain more money, they also need to set aside more cash for life and automotive insurance, fuel and maintenance, and taxes.\nBecause of this, owner-operators are more likely to be experienced truckers. Typically, those who have worked as company drivers for several years want more freedom and the chance to make their own decisions.\nIf you\u2019re a new trucker or are simply averse to taking more risks and responsibilities, you can become a company driver first to gain more experience and confidence.\nHow much does a freight broker charge per load?\nFreight brokers usually charge around 25-35% of the load.\nA freight broker is a middleman between a shipper and the carrier. They take the shipment from the customer and contact a carrier fleet to take the shipment to its destination.\nShippers like working with freight brokers because the broker deals with everything related to the carriers, becoming the single point of contact for updates. On the other side, carriers also like working with freight brokers because they can optimize routes and give the truckers multiple shipments to reduce deadhead miles.\nWhy trucking rates are important\nYour number one goal is to have a profitable trucking business, and keeping up with average trucking rates per mile is the best way to ensure that your business continues to grow. The key to this is having the right cost per mile trucking, so you win jobs and turn a profit.\nHopefully, you\u2019ve learned everything from what is the average rate per mile for hauling freight to standard truck shipping rates per mile in this article.\nTo recap, the truck rates you use for your business can be influenced by the:\nBy becoming an expert on what is the average trucking rate per mile and keeping up with industry trends, you\u2019ll be able to offer competitive prices and attract more customers, meaning more revenue.\nImage credit: Zetong Li via\u00a0Unsplash\nStreamline your business with Method\nStart your free trial \u2014 no credit card, no contract.\nFeatures\nCompany\n\nResources\nSupport\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Method Integration.

    "Summarized_Document": "Freight rates: Trucking rates per mile 2024\n\nIf you own a trucking business, ensuring profitability is crucial. Determining the best trucking rates per mile is key, but it can be complex due to constantly changing rates. This guide provides insights into current trucking rates per mile and essential industry terms.\n\nHow to calculate trucking freight rates\n\nTrucking rates are calculated by multiplying the rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points. The total trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles). Factors influencing trucking rates include distance, weight of the shipment, shipment density, and freight classification.\n\nKey factors in calculating trucking rates:\n\n1. Distance of travel: Ensure accurate mileage to avoid surprises and maintain profitability.\n2. Weight of the shipment: Manage overall weight load to control costs.\n3. Shipment density: Calculate by dividing cargo weight by its cubic feet.\n4. Freight classification: The NMFTA defines 18 classes of shipments affecting rates.\n\nTrucking companies charge customers per mile based on these factors. National average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile, but rates vary by area. Setting a fair per-mile rate ensures fair wages for truckers, happy clients, and profitability.\n\nIndustry terms to know:\n\n- Consignor: The party shipping the product.\n- Consignee: The recipient of the products.\n- Carrier: The party delivering the products.\n- Bill of lading (BOL): A document required in the shipping process.\n- Free on board point (FOB): Indicates liability for goods during shipping.\n- Loss and damage: Claims for visible damage or undelivered shipments.\n- Full truckload shipping (FTL): A shipment that takes up an entire trailer.\n- Less than truckload (LTL): A shipment that doesn't take up an entire trailer.\n- Load rates: Charges for delivering cargo, influenced by various factors.\n- Drayage: Shipping goods a short distance via ground freight.\n- Pallets: Portable platforms for packaging items for freight shipping.\n- Stop keeping unit (SKU): A service identification code for tracking products.\n- Hundredweight (CWT): A unit of measurement (100 pounds in North America).\n\nCurrent trucking rates per mile (2024 averages):\n\n- Flatbed: $3.14 per mile\n- Reefer: $3.19 per mile\n- Dry van: $2.50 per mile\n\nOwner-operators generally earn 70-80% of the load per mile. For example, with flatbed rates at $3.14 per mile, an owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. The remaining 20-30% goes to the trucking company for benefits like access to cargo jobs and in-house mechanics.\n\nTrucking rates are influenced by factors such as fuel prices, supply and demand, and global developments. Keeping up with industry trends and average rates ensures competitive pricing and profitability for your trucking business.",

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6).

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). Methods used to identify pediatric influenza-coded deaths on death certificates differ from those used to identify the influenza-associated pediatric deaths presented below, which require laboratory confirmation of influenza, and might not include the same individuals. One laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated death in a child <18 years of age was reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received nine reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths among children <18 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season. Influenza-associated Outbreaks Two laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks were reported during Week 11. To date, 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported to CDPH during the 2023\u20132024 season. One previously reported outbreak was removed because it did not meet the outbreak definition. Figure 9.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10. Percentage of Influenza-like Illness Visits among Patients Seen by Sentinel Providers \u2014 California Border Region, 2018\u20132024 Season to Date Virologic Surveillance Update The percentage of influenza detections in border region clinical sentinel laboratories during Week 11 was 5.0% (Figure 11).

Additionally, the bulletin also includes highlights regarding the boreal summer (June-July-August). Most of the reported findings are based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature highlights:\u00a0\n  \n\nGlobal Temperatures\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally (together with August 2023), with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August.\u202f\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was 1.51\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level and is the 13th month in a 14-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. *\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record for any 12-month period, at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. These values are identical to those recorded for the previous two 12-month periods, ending in June and July 2024.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.23\u00b0C warmer than the same period in 2023. The average anomaly for the remaining months of this year would need to drop by at least 0.30\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. This has never happened in the entire ERA5 dataset, making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record.\u00a0\n*Datasets other than ERA5 may not confirm the 13 months above 1.5\u00b0C highlighted here, due to the relatively small margins above 1.5\u00b0C of ERA5 global temperatures for July and August 2023 and May, June, and August 2024 and differences among the various datasets.\u00a0\nEurope and other regions\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for August 2024 was 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August, making the month the second warmest August on record for Europe after August 2022, which was 1.73\u00b0C above average.\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean temperatures were most above average over southern and eastern Europe, but below average over northwestern parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway.\u00a0\u00a0\nOutside Europe, temperatures were most above average over eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\nTemperatures were below average over far eastern Russia and Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan and the Sahel.\u00a0\nSea surface temperature\u00a0\nThe average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest value on record for the month, and only 0.07\u00b0C below August 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe equatorial Pacific had below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs across the oceans remained unusually high over many regions.\u00a0\nAccording to Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): \"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0\nMonthly year-to-date global surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for the ten warmest years on record. 2024 is shown with a red line, 2023 with a yellow line, and all other years with grey lines. Each data point shows the average anomaly from January to the corresponding month. E.g. the value for August 2024 corresponds to the average anomaly from January to August 2024. Data source: ERA5.

It delivers freely accessible operational data and services providing users with reliable and up-to-date information related to our planet and its environment. The programme is coordinated and managed by the European Commission and implemented in partnership with the Member States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), EU Agencies and Mercator Oc\u00e9an, amongst others.\u202f\u00a0\nECMWF operates two services from the EU\u2019s Copernicus Earth observation programme: the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). They also contribute to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), which is implemented by the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC). The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by 35 states. It is both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing and disseminating numerical weather predictions to its Member States. This data is fully available to the national meteorological services in the Member States. The supercomputer facility (and associated data archive) at ECMWF is one of the largest of its type in Europe and Member States can use 25% of its capacity for their own purposes.\u202f\u00a0\nECMWF has expanded its location across its Member States for some activities.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission, reports that August 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally, with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. This month was 1.51\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, marking the 13th month in a 14-month period where global temperatures exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. The year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, the highest on record for this period.In Europe, August 2024 was the second warmest on record, with temperatures 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Southern and eastern Europe experienced the highest anomalies, while northwestern parts of Ireland, the UK, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway were below average. Globally, temperatures were most above average in eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia, and below average in far eastern Russia, Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan, and the Sahel.The average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest on record for the month. The equatorial Pacific showed below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs remained unusually high in many regions.Hydrologically, August 2024 was drier than average over most of continental Europe, including southern UK and Ireland, the Alps, the Balkans, northwest Russia, and eastern Fennoscandia, with droughts and wildfires in the south and east. Conversely, Iceland, northern UK and Ireland, much of Fennoscandia, the northern seaboard of continental Europe, and western Russia and T\u00fcrkiye experienced above-average precipitation, leading to floods and damage in some areas. Outside Europe, eastern North America, central Russia, eastern China, and eastern Australia were wetter than average, while Mexico, southern North America, regions of Russia, China, most of South America, and Southern Africa were drier than average, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia, and Brazil.The global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C). The average temperature for European land for summer 2024 was the highest on record at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Summer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe, while most of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe experienced drier-than-average conditions, sometimes associated with drought.The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides detailed monthly climate bulletins based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations worldwide.

Additionally, the bulletin also includes highlights regarding the boreal summer (June-July-August). Most of the reported findings are based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature highlights:\u00a0\n  \n\nGlobal Temperatures\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally (together with August 2023), with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August.\u202f\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was 1.51\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level and is the 13th month in a 14-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. *\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record for any 12-month period, at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. These values are identical to those recorded for the previous two 12-month periods, ending in June and July 2024.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.23\u00b0C warmer than the same period in 2023. The average anomaly for the remaining months of this year would need to drop by at least 0.30\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. This has never happened in the entire ERA5 dataset, making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record.\u00a0\n*Datasets other than ERA5 may not confirm the 13 months above 1.5\u00b0C highlighted here, due to the relatively small margins above 1.5\u00b0C of ERA5 global temperatures for July and August 2023 and May, June, and August 2024 and differences among the various datasets.\u00a0\nEurope and other regions\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for August 2024 was 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August, making the month the second warmest August on record for Europe after August 2022, which was 1.73\u00b0C above average.\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean temperatures were most above average over southern and eastern Europe, but below average over northwestern parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway.\u00a0\u00a0\nOutside Europe, temperatures were most above average over eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\nTemperatures were below average over far eastern Russia and Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan and the Sahel.\u00a0\nSea surface temperature\u00a0\nThe average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest value on record for the month, and only 0.07\u00b0C below August 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe equatorial Pacific had below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs across the oceans remained unusually high over many regions.\u00a0\nAccording to Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): \"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0\nMonthly year-to-date global surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for the ten warmest years on record. 2024 is shown with a red line, 2023 with a yellow line, and all other years with grey lines. Each data point shows the average anomaly from January to the corresponding month. E.g. the value for August 2024 corresponds to the average anomaly from January to August 2024. Data source: ERA5.

Note that ERA5 SSTs are estimates of the ocean temperature at about 10m depth (known as foundation temperature). The results may differ from other SST products providing temperature estimates at different depths, such as 20cm depth for NOAA\u2019s OISST.\u00a0\nSea ice maps and data are from a combination of information from ERA5, as well as from the EUMETSAT OSI SAF Sea Ice Index v2.2.\u00a0\nRegional area averages quoted here are the following longitude/latitude bounds:\u00a0\nGlobe, 180W-180E, 90S-90N, over land and ocean surfaces.\u00a0\nEurope, 25W-40E, 34N-72N, over land surfaces only.\u00a0\u00a0\nAbout the Data and Analysis\nInformation on national records and impacts:\u00a0\nInformation on national records and impacts are based on national and regional reports. For details see the respective temperature and hydrological C3S climate bulletin for the month.\u00a0\nC3S has followed the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to use the most recent 30-year period for calculating climatological averages and changed to the reference period of 1991-2020 for its C3S Climate Bulletins covering January 2021 onward.

It delivers freely accessible operational data and services providing users with reliable and up-to-date information related to our planet and its environment. The programme is coordinated and managed by the European Commission and implemented in partnership with the Member States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), EU Agencies and Mercator Oc\u00e9an, amongst others.\u202f\u00a0\nECMWF operates two services from the EU\u2019s Copernicus Earth observation programme: the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). They also contribute to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), which is implemented by the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC). The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by 35 states. It is both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing and disseminating numerical weather predictions to its Member States. This data is fully available to the national meteorological services in the Member States. The supercomputer facility (and associated data archive) at ECMWF is one of the largest of its type in Europe and Member States can use 25% of its capacity for their own purposes.\u202f\u00a0\nECMWF has expanded its location across its Member States for some activities.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission, reports that August 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally, with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. This month was 1.51\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, marking the 13th month in a 14-month period where global temperatures exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. The year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, the highest on record for this period.In Europe, August 2024 was the second warmest on record, with temperatures 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Southern and eastern Europe experienced the highest anomalies, while northwestern parts of Ireland, the UK, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway were below average. Globally, temperatures were most above average in eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia, and below average in far eastern Russia, Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan, and the Sahel.The average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest on record for the month. The equatorial Pacific showed below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs remained unusually high in many regions.Hydrologically, August 2024 was drier than average over most of continental Europe, including southern UK and Ireland, the Alps, the Balkans, northwest Russia, and eastern Fennoscandia, with droughts and wildfires in the south and east. Conversely, Iceland, northern UK and Ireland, much of Fennoscandia, the northern seaboard of continental Europe, and western Russia and T\u00fcrkiye experienced above-average precipitation, leading to floods and damage in some areas. Outside Europe, eastern North America, central Russia, eastern China, and eastern Australia were wetter than average, while Mexico, southern North America, regions of Russia, China, most of South America, and Southern Africa were drier than average, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia, and Brazil.The global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C). The average temperature for European land for summer 2024 was the highest on record at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Summer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe, while most of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe experienced drier-than-average conditions, sometimes associated with drought.The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides detailed monthly climate bulletins based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations worldwide.

    "Summarized_Document": "Lionel Messi could dribble his way out of a phone box that he'd been locked in with five world-class defenders while handcuffed and wearing flip-flops. Say what you like about his standing in the GOAT debate, but you'd have to be the most cynical football fan of all time if you don't feel at least a little bit giddy when Messi dribbles at full speed. Yes, you could well throw the book at him whenever his mazy runs don't end up in a goal or assist, but sometimes that simply doesn't matter and the sheer spectacle of football is what provides the joy.\n\nThe magic of Messi\n\nAnd that's why so many of Messi's biggest fans are drawn to the way he plays the game, barely caring what the final score might be or how many goals he scores, but just unabashedly focusing on the entertainment factor. It's the whole argument that Messi is the greatest player of all time for simply having a certain je ne sais quoi that transcends Twitter threads, fan arguments and Ballon d'Or totals. However, before we go down a flowery and poetic rabbit hole of what it is that makes Messi special, let's try and ground it in the statistics because even the most seemingly unquantifiable things are always quantifiable to an extent in the world of football.\n\nMost successful dribblers since 2009\n\nAnd courtesy of the brilliant Twitter account that is @ThePopFoot, we're seldom left wanting for statistical comparisons that allow us to see the European men's game in different and exciting ways. The latest of which, it just so happens, sees the swashbuckling, take-on-all-comers approach of Messi take the spotlight as they have revealed the players with the most successful dribbles in single seasons since 2009. A fascinating measure not just of how much certain players go for the jugular by using dribbling, but also, simply put, how good or not they are at actually completing said slaloms past defenders. And let's just say that the results paint a quite astonishing picture in which the sheer brilliance of Messi's dribbling prowess couldn't be any clearer, so be sure to check out the top 20 down below:\n\n20.

Say what you like about his standing in the GOAT debate, but you'd have to be the most cynical football fan of all time if you don't feel at least a little bit giddy when Messi dribbles at full speed. Yes, you could well throw the book at him whenever his mazy runs don't end up in a goal or assist, but sometimes that simply doesn't matter and the sheer spectacle of football is what provides the joy.\n\nThe magic of Messi\n\nAnd that's why so many of Messi's biggest fans are drawn to the way he plays the game, barely caring what the final score might be or how many goals he scores, but just unabashedly focusing on the entertainment factor. It's the whole argument that Messi is the greatest player of all time for simply having a certain je ne sais quoi that transcends Twitter threads, fan arguments and Ballon d'Or totals. However, before we go down a flowery and poetic rabbit hole of what it is that makes Messi special, let's try and ground it in the statistics because even the most seemingly unquantifiable things are always quantifiable to an extent in the world of football.\n\nMost successful dribblers since 2009\n\nAnd courtesy of the brilliant Twitter account that is @ThePopFoot, we're seldom left wanting for statistical comparisons that allow us to see the European men's game in different and exciting ways. The latest of which, it just so happens, sees the swashbuckling, take-on-all-comers approach of Messi take the spotlight as they have revealed the players with the most successful dribbles in single seasons since 2009. A fascinating measure not just of how much certain players go for the jugular by using dribbling, but also, simply put, how good or not they are at actually completing said slaloms past defenders. And let's just say that the results paint a quite astonishing picture in which the sheer brilliance of Messi's dribbling prowess couldn't be any clearer, so be sure to check out the top 20 down below:\n\n20. Franck Ribery (2011/12) - 160 successful dribbles\n19. Yacine Brahimi (2013/14) - 161\n18. Wilfried Zaha (2019/20) - 163\n17. Lionel Messi (2013/14) - 167\n16. Lionel Messi (2018/19) - 169\n15. Eden Hazard (2018/19) - 170\n14. Karim Bellarabi (2014/15) - 172\n13. Eden Hazard (2013/14) - 174\n12. Lionel Messi (2020/21) - 188\n11. Neymar (2015/16) - 189\n10. Neymar (2017/18) - 193\n9. Eden Hazard (2017/18) - 199\n8. Lionel Messi (2009/10) - 202\n7. Neymar (2016/17) - 218\n6. Lionel Messi (2011/12) - 220\n5. Lionel Messi (2017/18) - 222\n4. Eden Hazard (2014/15) - 231\n3. Lionel Messi (2019/20) - 239\n2. Lionel Messi (2010/11) - 265\n\nMessi in a league of his own\n\nYou can also check out the original tweet complete with its full graphic down below to see the total number of dribbles each player attempted, as well as their success rate, on the way to their total. But regardless of whether you want to screenshot it for your camera roll, look at it through a telescope or print it off for an A3 canvas on your living room wall, the magnificence of Messi's dribbling is unmissable each and every time. For the Paris Saint-Germain superstar to take nine of the 20 slots all by himself, including five of the top six positions, is the stuff that dreams are made off. The man is a dribbling machine. And it really does make you want to give the likes of Hazard and Neymar a rapturous round of applause because the fact that they ever managed to get in vaguely the same ballpark as Messi in an achievement unto itself. After all, there is many a great player who have fallen short with Cristiano Ronaldo no less proving conspicuous by his absence, though his finest dribbling days did admittedly come prior to 2009. So hats off to the forever-entertaining Zaha for muscling his way in despite playing for a mid-table Crystal Palace side, while Bellarabi and Brahimi also punched above their weight in the Bundesliga and La Liga respectively. However, when you consider that Messi's most dribble-heavy season is a staggering 35 runs above the next highest finisher who isn't him, you just know that he's simply in a league of his own.",

    "Document": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit.\nThis novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level.\nAlthough this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates.\nPhoto from iStock 157317957 Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock.\n2 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d1 in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014 communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities.\nHousing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%.2 1 DOE\u2019s working definition of disadvantaged is based on cumulative burden and includes data for 36 burden indicators collected at the census tract level.

The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2.\nHigh-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3.\nA co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat Table 2.

The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history.8,9 Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan10 identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency.\nPaired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as 8 Cusick, Daniel. 2020. \u201cChicago Learned Climate Lessons from Its Deadly 1995 Heat Wave.\u201d Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chicago-learned-climate-lessons-from-its-deadly-1995-heat-wave1/ 9 Thomas, Mike. 2015. \u201cChicago\u2019s Deadly 1995 Heat Wave: An Oral History.\u201d Chicago Magazine. https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2015/1995-Chicago-heat-wave/ 10 City of Chicago. 2022a.

This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago.

CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool.11 These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago.\nIn addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study.\n11 https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types.

This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings.\nHomes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry 12 City of Chicago. 2022b. Chicago Recovery Plan. https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/chicago-recovery-plan/home.html construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction.\n\u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps.\n\u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid.\nAlong with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

    "Summarized_Document": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit. This novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level. Although this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates. Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock. The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. Housing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%. Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety. We selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1. Community Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago, the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs. Estimation of Energy Savings Potential From Retrofit Programs Using NREL\u2019s ResStock Analysis Tool Of the dozen or so retrofit packages explored by Elevate and NREL, we selected three candidate packages designed to be cost-effective, code compliant, and having a high potential to reduce energy consumption. The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2. High-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3. A co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat waves. The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history. Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency. Paired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as the same building without the heat pump upgrade. This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago. Advanced retrofit packages with heat pumps have the potential to reduce Chicago\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2.5 million metric tons per year\u2014the equivalent of 500,000 cars taken off the road! If these two top packages (Package 2 and 3) are deployed in all 323,000 Chicago buildings from the five selected housing types, there would be significant energy savings, bill savings, and CO2 savings, as shown in Table 4. CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool. These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago. In addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study. How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants.

For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction. \u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps. \u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid. Along with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

    "Document": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit.\nThis novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level.\nAlthough this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates.\nPhoto from iStock 157317957 Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock.\n2 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d1 in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014 communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities.\nHousing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%.2 1 DOE\u2019s working definition of disadvantaged is based on cumulative burden and includes data for 36 burden indicators collected at the census tract level. These burden indicators can be grouped across four categories: energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, fossil dependence, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. https://www.energy.gov/diversity/justice40-initiative 2 According to Elevate analysis of 2014 data from Cook County property assessor.\n3 According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/fmr98/sect8.html 4 https://resilient.chicago.gov/ Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]3), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety.\nWe selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1.\nCommunity Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago,4 the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs.\n3 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Table 1.

The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2.\nHigh-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3.\nA co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat Table 2.

The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history.8,9 Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan10 identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency.\nPaired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as 8 Cusick, Daniel. 2020. \u201cChicago Learned Climate Lessons from Its Deadly 1995 Heat Wave.\u201d Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chicago-learned-climate-lessons-from-its-deadly-1995-heat-wave1/ 9 Thomas, Mike. 2015. \u201cChicago\u2019s Deadly 1995 Heat Wave: An Oral History.\u201d Chicago Magazine. https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2015/1995-Chicago-heat-wave/ 10 City of Chicago. 2022a.

This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago.

CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool.11 These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago.\nIn addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study.\n11 https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types.

This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households.

    "Summarized_Document": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit. This novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level. Although this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates. Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock. The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. Housing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%. Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety. We selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1. Community Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago, the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs. Estimation of Energy Savings Potential From Retrofit Programs Using NREL\u2019s ResStock Analysis Tool Of the dozen or so retrofit packages explored by Elevate and NREL, we selected three candidate packages designed to be cost-effective, code compliant, and having a high potential to reduce energy consumption. The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2. High-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3. A co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat waves. The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history. Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency. Paired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as the same building without the heat pump upgrade. This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago. Advanced retrofit packages with heat pumps have the potential to reduce Chicago\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2.5 million metric tons per year\u2014the equivalent of 500,000 cars taken off the road! If these two top packages (Package 2 and 3) are deployed in all 323,000 Chicago buildings from the five selected housing types, there would be significant energy savings, bill savings, and CO2 savings, as shown in Table 4. CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool. These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago. In addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study. How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types. At the time of release of this case study, the City of Chicago is directly investing $46 million from the Chicago Recovery Plan into energy and equity projects. Approximately half of this amount is reserved for retrofits in single-family and multifamily buildings. This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings. Homes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction. \u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps. \u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid. Along with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, Amazon Studios, and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by Amazon.

Significant business model issues have been starting to manifest for fleets already deploying battery-electric trucks.\nIn many respects, Sanchez\u2019s message echoed that of J.B. Hunt President Shelley Simpson the previous day.\nBEV Technology is Still in its Infancy\nLooking at diesel versus electric in light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Sanchez said that while Ryder expected to see cost increases for adopting BEVs instead of conventional diesel trucks, they did not expect to see the magnitude of those costs, which he cited as a major barrier to widespread adoption at the current time.\n\u201cWe know the commercial EVs beyond light-duty transit vans are not ready for mass adoption due to price range and payload limitations,\u201d Sanchez told show attendees.\n\u201cWe also know that we have a lack of critical charging infrastructure, and we would [have to] make major improvements to their power grid in order to support it.\n\u201cFrom our point of view, for commercial EVs to work in the real world, we need a breakthrough in battery technology and an expansion of the charging infrastructure. We need an inflection point.\u201d\nToday's EVs are Like the First Mobile Phones\nSanchez produced a vintage Motorola \u201cbrick\u201d cell phone from the podium to make his next point: That BEV technology \u2014 much like the brick cell phone in the late 1970s \u2014 is still in the very earliest stage of its development path.\nOver time, of course, cellphone technology improved exponentially. Better batteries were developed. Phones got smaller. And, as more and more capabilities were added, they eventually evolved into smartphones.\nThere\u2019s a distinct parallel between the evolution of cellular and commercial zero-emissions vehicle technology, Sanchez said. Like the cell phone, he added, the industry needs electric vehicle costs to come down.\n\u201cWe need smaller, lighter and more powerful battery technology to improve the range and capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need a nationwide infrastructure. We need the fastest applicable charges available where professional drivers can conveniently charge their trucks.\u201d\nWe Need a Technological Breakthrough\nThe North American trucking industry clearly needs a new technological breakthrough to drive capabilities up and costs down. The problem, Sanchez cautioned, is that we don\u2019t know when that breakthrough will come, and what kind of changes it will bring.\nThe real-world numbers highlight the scope of issue.\n\u201cAt Ryder, we have a stable of nearly 250,000 commercial vehicles,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd only 60 of those trucks are EVs.\n\u201cWe also have 40,000 commercial vehicle customers. And so far, only 18 of them have chosen to deploy EVs in their fleets.\u201d\nThose figures hold true for the North American trucking industry at large, Sanchez added. He said that there are nearly 16 million commercial vehicles in service in North America today. And to date, only 28,000 of them are EVs.\n\u201cThe problem is not lack of interest,\u201d Sanchez explained. \u201cWe have many customers who asked about the cost benefit of converting to EVs. We found that there was significant barrier to conversion in the total cost of transport, or the TCT.\u201d\nTCT, he explained, includes the cost of vehicle, fuel or electricity, driver wages, as well as other factors that go into transporting the same load the same distance and achieving the equivalent delivery times.\nThe business case for converting to BEV technology just isn\u2019t there yet, Sanchez said.\nIn fact, he added, if you take the average load that is currently being moved by a heavy-duty diesel truck today and convert that tractor to electric, it requires nearly two vehicles and more than two trailers to deliver the same load at the same time as one diesel vehicle, at more than double TCT.\n\u201cI think most of you would agree that this is a tough sell.\u201d\nThe Diesel and Electric Total Cost of Transport Gap\nRyder did the math to better understand how significant the TCT gap between diesel and battery-electric trucks actually is. The results are detailed in a white paper, \u201cCharged Logistics: The cost of electric vehicle conversion for U.S. commercial fleets.\u201d\nRyder analyzed the total cost to transport, in one-to-one comparisons, for transitioning Class 4 (light-duty), Class 6 (medium-duty), and Class 8 (heavy-duty) vehicles operating in California and Georgia from internal combustion engines to EVs in today\u2019s market.\nThen it also examined the TCT for transitioning a mixed fleet (light, medium, and heavy) of 25 ICE vehicles to EVs. The mix was based on the overall mix of commercial vehicles in the U.S. according to Polk Data Services.\nThe analysis is based on representative network loads and routes from Ryder\u2019s dedicated fleet operations, which includes more than 13,000 commercial vehicles and professional drivers, as well as the impact of EV charging time and maximum payload to achieve equivalent delivery times.\nCritical factors include general labor, energy costs, loads and routes, Sanchez explained.\n\u201cWe then factored in a number of cost assumptions using current market prices for vehicles, maintenance, fuel, and charging infrastructure. We also factored in driver\u2019s wages, other professional costs, as well as general and administrative expenses.\u201d\nThen, Ryder took the range and payload capabilities needed to achieve equivalent diesel delivery targets and ran the numbers.\n\u201cIt currently costs about $170,000 a year to run the light-duty diesel Transit van,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cFor electric vehicles, that cost increases an estimated 3%. The cost of the vehicle nearly doubles. However, maintenance cost savings largely offset the increase in vehicle cost.\u201d\nThe additional driver hours needed for EV charging time in Georgia costs a fleet about $156,000 per year.

Significant business model issues have been starting to manifest for fleets already deploying battery-electric trucks.\nIn many respects, Sanchez\u2019s message echoed that of J.B. Hunt President Shelley Simpson the previous day.\nBEV Technology is Still in its Infancy\nLooking at diesel versus electric in light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Sanchez said that while Ryder expected to see cost increases for adopting BEVs instead of conventional diesel trucks, they did not expect to see the magnitude of those costs, which he cited as a major barrier to widespread adoption at the current time.\n\u201cWe know the commercial EVs beyond light-duty transit vans are not ready for mass adoption due to price range and payload limitations,\u201d Sanchez told show attendees.\n\u201cWe also know that we have a lack of critical charging infrastructure, and we would [have to] make major improvements to their power grid in order to support it.\n\u201cFrom our point of view, for commercial EVs to work in the real world, we need a breakthrough in battery technology and an expansion of the charging infrastructure. We need an inflection point.\u201d\nToday's EVs are Like the First Mobile Phones\nSanchez produced a vintage Motorola \u201cbrick\u201d cell phone from the podium to make his next point: That BEV technology \u2014 much like the brick cell phone in the late 1970s \u2014 is still in the very earliest stage of its development path.\nOver time, of course, cellphone technology improved exponentially. Better batteries were developed. Phones got smaller. And, as more and more capabilities were added, they eventually evolved into smartphones.\nThere\u2019s a distinct parallel between the evolution of cellular and commercial zero-emissions vehicle technology, Sanchez said. Like the cell phone, he added, the industry needs electric vehicle costs to come down.\n\u201cWe need smaller, lighter and more powerful battery technology to improve the range and capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need a nationwide infrastructure. We need the fastest applicable charges available where professional drivers can conveniently charge their trucks.\u201d\nWe Need a Technological Breakthrough\nThe North American trucking industry clearly needs a new technological breakthrough to drive capabilities up and costs down. The problem, Sanchez cautioned, is that we don\u2019t know when that breakthrough will come, and what kind of changes it will bring.\nThe real-world numbers highlight the scope of issue.\n\u201cAt Ryder, we have a stable of nearly 250,000 commercial vehicles,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd only 60 of those trucks are EVs.\n\u201cWe also have 40,000 commercial vehicle customers. And so far, only 18 of them have chosen to deploy EVs in their fleets.\u201d\nThose figures hold true for the North American trucking industry at large, Sanchez added. He said that there are nearly 16 million commercial vehicles in service in North America today. And to date, only 28,000 of them are EVs.\n\u201cThe problem is not lack of interest,\u201d Sanchez explained. \u201cWe have many customers who asked about the cost benefit of converting to EVs. We found that there was significant barrier to conversion in the total cost of transport, or the TCT.\u201d\nTCT, he explained, includes the cost of vehicle, fuel or electricity, driver wages, as well as other factors that go into transporting the same load the same distance and achieving the equivalent delivery times.\nThe business case for converting to BEV technology just isn\u2019t there yet, Sanchez said.\nIn fact, he added, if you take the average load that is currently being moved by a heavy-duty diesel truck today and convert that tractor to electric, it requires nearly two vehicles and more than two trailers to deliver the same load at the same time as one diesel vehicle, at more than double TCT.\n\u201cI think most of you would agree that this is a tough sell.\u201d\nThe Diesel and Electric Total Cost of Transport Gap\nRyder did the math to better understand how significant the TCT gap between diesel and battery-electric trucks actually is. The results are detailed in a white paper, \u201cCharged Logistics: The cost of electric vehicle conversion for U.S. commercial fleets.\u201d\nRyder analyzed the total cost to transport, in one-to-one comparisons, for transitioning Class 4 (light-duty), Class 6 (medium-duty), and Class 8 (heavy-duty) vehicles operating in California and Georgia from internal combustion engines to EVs in today\u2019s market.\nThen it also examined the TCT for transitioning a mixed fleet (light, medium, and heavy) of 25 ICE vehicles to EVs. The mix was based on the overall mix of commercial vehicles in the U.S. according to Polk Data Services.\nThe analysis is based on representative network loads and routes from Ryder\u2019s dedicated fleet operations, which includes more than 13,000 commercial vehicles and professional drivers, as well as the impact of EV charging time and maximum payload to achieve equivalent delivery times.\nCritical factors include general labor, energy costs, loads and routes, Sanchez explained.\n\u201cWe then factored in a number of cost assumptions using current market prices for vehicles, maintenance, fuel, and charging infrastructure. We also factored in driver\u2019s wages, other professional costs, as well as general and administrative expenses.\u201d\nThen, Ryder took the range and payload capabilities needed to achieve equivalent diesel delivery targets and ran the numbers.\n\u201cIt currently costs about $170,000 a year to run the light-duty diesel Transit van,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cFor electric vehicles, that cost increases an estimated 3%. The cost of the vehicle nearly doubles. However, maintenance cost savings largely offset the increase in vehicle cost.\u201d\nThe additional driver hours needed for EV charging time in Georgia costs a fleet about $156,000 per year. And while equipment maintenance costs remain the same as that of California, Sanchez noted, Georgia\u2019s lower fuel and energy costs do not provide the same level of savings while transitioning from diesel to electric. All this results in a higher cost disadvantage for Georgia than California.\nHeavy-Duty Comparison\nAs the study moved from light-duty to larger vehicles, the cost benefits start to wane even more.\nLooking at Class 8, in Georgia, it costs a fleet about $291,000 to run a diesel-powered truck. In California, it\u2019s about $334,000 per year.\nBut given current BEV range and payload limitations, Sanchez said it could require nearly twice the equipment and more than twice the labor compared to a diesel truck for fleets to deliver the same loads.\nSo for that same fleet in Georgia, an electric truck would take $622,438 to deliver the same loads.\nIn California, the cost to deliver those same loads with electric would cost $648,712.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs and 56% to 67% to convert mixed fleets of 25 vehicles, depending on which state.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs.\nImage: HDT graphic\nUltimately, consumers will have to pay for those prices increases.\n\u201cKeep in mind that nearly three-quarters of all goods in the U.S. are transported by trucks,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSo if you extrapolate the TCT analysis for the entire U.S. fleet of commercial vehicles to a 100% transition to EVs, and passing the average total cost of transport on to consumers, we estimate that this increased costs cumulatively adding from .5% to 1% in overall inflation.\u201d\nCan the Cost Parity Gap Be Closed?\nSanchez said the purpose of Ryder\u2019s analysis is to quantify the current gap in cost between diesel and EVS and to identify the cost drivers.\nThis, in turn, will help equipment manufacturers, technology companies, innovators, and regulators to better focus their ZEV development efforts.\n\u201cWe believe those to be advanced battery technology to address payload and range limitations, reducing vehicle costs, and building out sufficient charging networks and delivering power,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe believe [by addressing] those three areas \u2026 we can start to close the gap and created a cost parity between diesel and electric trucks.\u201d\nThere are also multiple ways to reduce vehicle emissions, including electric, natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, as well as continuing to advance diesel emissions technology, Sanchez added.\n\u201cPeople and businesses will see the benefits of zero-emission vehicles,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAnd mass adoption will follow.

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

    "Summarized_Document": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",
