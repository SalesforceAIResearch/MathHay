Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock\u2019s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I\u2019ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm\u2019s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla\u2019s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla\u2019s \u201cdifficult environment,\u201d the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it\u2019s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla\u2019s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla\u2019s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA\u2019s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla\u2019s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla\u2019s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company\u2019s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%.\nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla\u2019s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles.\nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that\u2019s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Extracted numerical values from the document\n    tesla_volatility = 53.17  # Tesla's Volatility as of October 29, 2024\n    stock_price_recovery = 8.04  # Percentage recovery in Tesla's stock price\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the product of Tesla's volatility and stock price recovery\n    answer = tesla_volatility * stock_price_recovery\n\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "No",
    "pred_reasoning": "Tesla's volatility as of October 29, 2024, is 53.17%. On August 5, 2024, Tesla's stock price dropped by 12.4% due to an interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan. Over the five days following this drop, Tesla's stock price recovered by 8.04%. To find the product of Tesla's volatility and the percentage recovery, we multiply 53.17% by 8.04%. Converting percentages to decimals, we have 0.5317 * 0.0804 = 0.04275588. Converting back to percentage, the product is 4.275588%.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Solution 1 calculates the product of Tesla's volatility and stock price recovery directly using the percentage values as they are, resulting in 427.48679999999996. Solution 2, however, converts the percentages to decimals before multiplying, resulting in 0.04275588, and then converts this back to a percentage, resulting in 4.275588%. The two solutions use different methods for handling percentages, leading to different final answers. Therefore, the solutions are not equivalent."

Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock\u2019s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I\u2019ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm\u2019s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla\u2019s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla\u2019s \u201cdifficult environment,\u201d the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it\u2019s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla\u2019s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla\u2019s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA\u2019s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla\u2019s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla\u2019s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company\u2019s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%.\nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla\u2019s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles.\nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that\u2019s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

    "correct": false,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Extracted numerical values from the document\n    global_deliveries_2023 = 1800000  # Total vehicles delivered by Tesla in 2023\n    quarterly_revenue_2024 = 25500000000  # Tesla's revenue in the most recent quarter of 2024\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the average revenue per vehicle delivered\n    answer = quarterly_revenue_2024 / global_deliveries_2023\n\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "No",
    "pred_reasoning": "To find the average revenue per vehicle delivered by Tesla in 2023, we need to use the revenue and the number of vehicles delivered. From the Long-Context Documents, Tesla's revenue for the most recent quarter of 2024 is $40.589 billion. In 2023, Tesla delivered a little over 1.8 million vehicles. Assuming the revenue for the quarter is representative of the average quarterly revenue in 2023, we can estimate the annual revenue by multiplying the quarterly revenue by 4, which gives us $162.356 billion. Dividing this estimated annual revenue by the number of vehicles delivered (1.8 million) gives us the average revenue per vehicle: $162.356 billion / 1.8 million vehicles = $90,197.78 per vehicle.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions are different in both reasoning and final answer. Solution 1 calculates the average revenue per vehicle by dividing the quarterly revenue of $25.5 billion by the number of vehicles delivered in 2023, which is 1.8 million, resulting in an answer of approximately $14,166.67. Solution 2, on the other hand, uses a different quarterly revenue figure of $40.589 billion, assumes it represents the average quarterly revenue for 2023, and estimates the annual revenue by multiplying by 4, resulting in $162.356 billion. This annual revenue is then divided by the number of vehicles delivered to get an average revenue per vehicle of $90,197.78. The two solutions use different revenue figures and calculation methods, leading to different final answers."

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

    "pred_reasoning": "First, extract the relevant numerical information from the Long-Context Documents. Google's closing stock price in November 2024 is $177, and in December 2024, it is $180. The difference between these two prices is $180 - $177 = $3. Next, extract Meta's financial data for the third quarter of 2024. Meta's revenue for Q3 2024 is $40,589 million, and the net income is $15,688 million. The difference between Meta's revenue and net income is $40,589 million - $15,688 million = $24,901 million. Finally, sum the difference in Google's stock prices and the difference between Meta's revenue and net income: $3 + $24,901 million = $24,904 million.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they calculate the difference between Google's closing stock prices for November and December 2024, and the difference between Meta's revenue and net income for Q3 2024. They then sum these two differences to arrive at the final answer. The final numerical answers are also identical, with Solution 1 providing an integer and Solution 2 providing a float, which are equivalent in value. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent."

    "pred_reasoning": "To find the sum of Apple's operating income for the three months ending June 29, 2024, and Microsoft's operating income for the quarter ending June 30, 2024, we first extract the relevant numerical data from the documents. Apple's operating income for the specified period is $25,352 million. Microsoft's operating income for the specified period is $27,925 million. Adding these two values together gives us the total operating income: $25,352 million + $27,925 million = $53,277 million.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they extract the operating income values for Apple and Microsoft from the documents, and then they calculate the sum of these values. The final numerical answers are also effectively identical, with Solution 1 providing an integer and Solution 2 providing a float representation of the same number. The slight difference in format (integer vs. float) does not affect the equivalence of the solutions in terms of reasoning and final answer."

    "pred_reasoning": "To find the difference between the total net sales of Apple Inc. for the three months ending June 29, 2024, and Microsoft's cloud revenue for the quarter ending June 30, 2024, we first extract the relevant figures from the documents. Apple's total net sales for the specified period are $85,777 million. Microsoft's cloud revenue for the same period is $36,800 million. The difference between these two figures is calculated as $85,777 million - $36,800 million = $48,977 million.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Solution 1 calculates Apple's total net sales by summing Apple's products and services sales, which are $61,564 million and $24,213 million respectively, resulting in a total of $85,777 million. It then subtracts Microsoft's cloud revenue of $36,800 million to find the difference, which is $48,977 million. Solution 2 directly states Apple's total net sales as $85,777 million and Microsoft's cloud revenue as $36,800 million, and calculates the difference as $48,977 million. Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps and arrive at the same final numerical answer."

    "pred_reasoning": "To find the total Microsoft Cloud revenue for Q3 and Q4 of fiscal year 2024, we need to extract the revenue figures for these quarters from the provided documents. According to the document, the Microsoft Cloud revenue for Q3 of fiscal year 2024 was $35.1 billion, and for Q4 of fiscal year 2024, it was $36.8 billion. Adding these two figures gives us the total Microsoft Cloud revenue for the two quarters: $35.1 billion + $36.8 billion = $71.9 billion.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they extract the revenue figures for Q3 and Q4 of fiscal year 2024, add these figures together, and arrive at the same final numerical answer of 71.9. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent in terms of reasoning and final answer."

Through the end of October, FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has approved 38 new drugs. Which companies \u00a0and products have made the cut, and which may be best poised for market success?\nBy Patricia Van Arnum, Editorial Director, DCAT, pvanarnum@dcat.org\nNew drug approvals thus far in 2024Although not following a strictly chronological path, examining the pace of new drug approvals is an important measure of product innovation in the bio/pharma industry. Through the end of October (as of October 31, 2024), the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) had approved 38 new molecular entities (NMEs) and biological therapeutics, compared to 46 new drugs approved through October 2023.\nLast year (2023) saw an uptick in new drug approvals compared to 2022, which was a recent dip in new drug approvals. In 2023, FDA\u2019s CDER approved 55 NMEs and new biological therapeutics, a 49% increase in the number of new drug approvals compared to 2022, when 37 new drugs were approved. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 by FDA\u2019s CDER was in line with recent years. In 2021, 50 NMEs and new biological therapeutics were approved and 53 in 2020. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 represented the second highest level of approvals in the past decade, except for 2018 when 59 new drugs were approved (see Figure 1).\nSmall molecules versus biologicsAnother important trend to look at is the product mix of new drug approvals. Of the 38 new drug approvals thus far in 2024 (as of October 31, 2024), 26, or 68%, were small molecules (24 drugs and two diagnostic/imaging agents), and 12, or 32%, were biologics. That is on par with the mix in 2023, when FDA\u2019s CDER approved 17 new biological therapeutics, which represented 31% of new drug approvals, and 38 small-molecule products or 69% of new drug approvals (see Figure 2).\nThe percentage of small-molecule approvals in 2023 was in line with recent years, except in 2022, which represented a recent low. In 2022, 59% of the new drug approvals by FDA\u2019s CDER were small molecules or 22 of the 37 new drug approved. Between 2018 and 2021, small molecules averaged 74% of new drug approvals. In 2021, small molecules represented 72% of new drug approvals, 75% in 2020,\u00a0 79% in 2019, and 71% in 2018.\nThe decrease in small molecules\u2019 share of new drug approvals in 2022 was largely due to the overall decline in new drug approvals in 2022 and a corresponding decline in small-molecule drug approvals and a rise in new biologic drug approvals. In 2022, FDA\u2019s CDER approved 22 new small-molecule drugs and 15 new biologics. The 17 new biologics approved in 2023 surpassed 2022 levels and matched a recent high in 2018, when 17 new biologics were approved by FDA\u2019s CDER, far exceeding biologic approvals of 14 in 2021, 13 in 2020, and 10 in 2019.\nLarge bio/pharma companies versus mid-tier/small companiesThe quantity of new drug approvals, alone, is not a singular measure of product innovation, but tracking it show some interesting trends, notably the increasing contribution of small bio/pharma companies, particularly in the small-molecule drug space. \u00a0\nOf the 38 new drugs approved thus far in 2024, 13, or 34%, were from large companies (defined as the top 25 bio/pharma companies based on 2023 revenues and one large medical technology company with approval of a diagnostic agent), and 25, or 66%, were from mid-sized or small companies. In looking at product mix, biologics accounted for more than half (54%) of new drug approvals by the large companies, but only 20% from mid-sized-to-small companies.\nThe large bio/pharma companies have had seven new biological therapeutics approved thus far in 2024 and five small-molecule drugs. For purposes of this analysis, new biological therapeutics only include those approved by FDA\u2019s CDER, which reviews and approves new molecular entities and new biological therapeutics. Other biologic-based products, including blood products, vaccines, allergenics, tissues, and cellular and gene therapies, are reviewed and approved by a separate center within FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\nSo which companies made the cut in biologics? The seven biologics approved from the large bio/pharma companies were: Amgen\u2019s Imdelltra (tarlatamab-dlle) for treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer; Astellas\u2019 Vyloy (zolbetuximab-clzb) for treating gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, a rare type of cancer of the esophagus; Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz) for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema); Lilly\u2019s Kisunla (donanemab-azbt) for treating early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease;\u00a0 Merck & Co.\u2019s Winrevair (sotatercept-csrk) for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare disease in which blood vessels in the lungs thicken and narrow, causing strain on the heart; \u00a0Pfizer\u2019s Hympavzi (marstacimab-hncq) for preventing or reducing bleeding episodes related to hemophilia A or B; and Roche\u2019s Piasky (crovalimab-akkz) for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare blood disorder.\nThe five small-molecule drug approvals from the large bio/pharmaceutical companies were: AstraZeneca\u2019s Voydeya (danicopan) for treating extravascular hemolysis with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disease; Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy (xanomeline and trospium chloride) for treating schizophrenia; Gilead Sciences\u2019 Livdelzi (seladelpar) for treating primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the liver\u2019s bile ducts, causing a buildup of bile and toxins;\u00a0 Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Lazcluze (lazertinib) for treating non-small cell lung cancer; Roche\u2019s Itovebi (inavolisib) for treating locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In addition, GE Healthcare gained FDA approval for Flyrcado (flurpiridaz F 18), a radioactive diagnostic drug to evaluate for myocardial ischemia and infarction.\nMid-tier & small bio/pharma companies: new drug approvalsSmall-molecules by far dominated new approvals from mid-sized to small companies, with many of the drugs indicated for rare diseases. Below is a roundup of small-molecule drug approvals from mid-sized and small companies thus far this year (as of October 31, 2024):\nOn the biologics side, small-to-mid-sized bio/pharma companies have had five biologics approved thus far in 2024. These are: BeiGene\u2019s Tevimbra (tislelizumab-jsgr) for treating unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer; Galderma\u2019s Nemluvio\u00a0(nemolizumab-ilto) for treating prurigo nodularis, a chronic skin disorder with itchy nodules; Hugel-Aesthetics\u2019 Letybo (letibotulinumtoxinA-wlbg) for temporarily improving the appearance of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines (i.e., so-called \u201cfrown lines\u201d); ImmunityBio\u2019s Anktiva (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln) for treating bladder cancer; and Incyte\u2019s Niktimvo (axatilimab-csfr) for treating chronic graft-versus-host disease.\n\n\nBio/Pharma\u2019s Rising Stars: The Companies Emerging on the Industry\u2019s Radar\nA Shortage of Inspectors Curtailing FDA Inspections: The Impact on Pharma\nA Look Ahead: Bio/Pharma\u2019s Top Policy Issues in US Elections Aftermath\nA Strong Contract ADC Market Drives Expansions in High-Potency Manufacturing\nOne Washington Blvd., Suite 6\nRobbinsville, NJ 08691, USA\n+1-609-208-1888\nToll Free: +1-800-640-DCAT (3288)\n\u00a9 2024 DCAT | Privacy Policy\nDCAT Value Chain Insights is produced by the Drug, Chemical &\nAssociated Technologies Association, a not-for-profit business\ndevelopment association for companies engaged in the global bio/pharmaceutical manufacturing value chain.

Why has the society not made faster progress on cancer front? Why do discoveries in biotechnology sector occur in fits and spurts? We claim that this slow and sporadic progress has a lot to do with the vagaries of capital markets. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begin with a success story. There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cleverage Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.\u00c2\u00a0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector.

Why has the society not made faster progress on cancer front? Why do discoveries in biotechnology sector occur in fits and spurts? We claim that this slow and sporadic progress has a lot to do with the vagaries of capital markets. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begin with a success story. There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cleverage Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.\u00c2\u00a0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\nNews\nLife\nEntertainment\nFinance\nSports\nNew on Yahoo\nYahoo Finance\nFDA Events Can Send Stocks Soaring: Here's One That Absolutely No One Is Talking About\nBiotech and healthcare stocks are loved by traders for their big price moves, which usually happen when a company makes progress (or faces problems) with their developmental products like drugs and devices. Results from Phase I, II and III clinical studies, and FDA or European approvals (and rejections), can send stocks soaring.\nEveryone is familiar with these monster moves. Recent examples include Amarin Corp's (AMRN) 3X move in one day, or Zosano Pharma Corporations' (ZSAN) 100% rip on recent study results. Now, a new entrant in the large neurological market, NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC), could be on the eve of their first FDA approval, and few investors are paying attention to this small company because it's so new and quiet about what they're doing.\nNevertheless, NMTC is 10% owned by the Mayo Clinic and has a stable of veteran physicians and researchers on their board and advisory board. With the possibility of two FDA clearances in 2019 for their first planned medical devices, the company could have a breakout year if they execute and move from unknown to mainstream.\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2019 / Small healthcare stocks are known for making heroic moves, often when their development-phase drugs or devices move closer to going commercial. Completion of Phase I, II, and III trials can all send stocks rallying, as can approvals from European and U.S. regulators.\nCase in point, Zosano Pharma's (ZSAN) recent monster 100% move recently when they announced success in a Trial of their drug for migraines. Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren't paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne's technologies - sometimes known as ''neurostimulation'' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company's public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt's an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson's using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson's, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson's, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient's skull!\nHere's where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company's initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne's technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they've already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they're working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC's public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic's Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company's scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company's new \"artificial intelligence\" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne's electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa's successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cleverage Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.\u00c2\u00a0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\nNews\nLife\nEntertainment\nFinance\nSports\nNew on Yahoo\nYahoo Finance\nFDA Events Can Send Stocks Soaring: Here's One That Absolutely No One Is Talking About\nBiotech and healthcare stocks are loved by traders for their big price moves, which usually happen when a company makes progress (or faces problems) with their developmental products like drugs and devices. Results from Phase I, II and III clinical studies, and FDA or European approvals (and rejections), can send stocks soaring.\nEveryone is familiar with these monster moves. Recent examples include Amarin Corp's (AMRN) 3X move in one day, or Zosano Pharma Corporations' (ZSAN) 100% rip on recent study results. Now, a new entrant in the large neurological market, NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC), could be on the eve of their first FDA approval, and few investors are paying attention to this small company because it's so new and quiet about what they're doing.\nNevertheless, NMTC is 10% owned by the Mayo Clinic and has a stable of veteran physicians and researchers on their board and advisory board. With the possibility of two FDA clearances in 2019 for their first planned medical devices, the company could have a breakout year if they execute and move from unknown to mainstream.\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2019 / Small healthcare stocks are known for making heroic moves, often when their development-phase drugs or devices move closer to going commercial. Completion of Phase I, II, and III trials can all send stocks rallying, as can approvals from European and U.S. regulators.\nCase in point, Zosano Pharma's (ZSAN) recent monster 100% move recently when they announced success in a Trial of their drug for migraines. Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren't paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne's technologies - sometimes known as ''neurostimulation'' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company's public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt's an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson's using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson's, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson's, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient's skull!\nHere's where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company's initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne's technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they've already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they're working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC's public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic's Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company's scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company's new \"artificial intelligence\" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne's electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa's successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

Areas that are hydrologically connected to the ocean are shown in shades of blue (darker blue = greater depth).\nLow-lying areas, displayed in green, are hydrologically \"unconnected\" areas that may also flood. They are determined solely by how well the elevation data captures the area\u2019s drainage characteristics. The mapping may not accurately capture detailed hydrologic/hydraulic features such as canals, ditches, and stormwater infrastructure. A more detailed analysis, may be required to determine the area\u2019s actual susceptibility to flooding.\nThere is not 100% confidence in the elevation data and/or mapping process. It is important not to focus on the exact extent of inundation, but rather to examine the level of confidence that the extent of inundation is accurate (see mapping confidence tab).\nScenarios\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research\r\n                            Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios\r\n                            provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            While these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter)\r\n                            scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has\r\n                            been removed.\r\n                        \n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\r\n                            The five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report\r\n                            NOS CO-OPS 083: \u201cGlobal and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\u201d using the same\r\n                            methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator. These new\r\n                            scenarios were developed by the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools\r\n                            Interagency Task Force, jointly convened by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the\r\n                            National Ocean Council as input to the USGCRP Sustained Assessment process and Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities. The changes in high tide flooding over time are greatest where elevation is lower, local RSL rise is higher, or extreme variability is less.\nIn a sense, today\u2019s flood will become tomorrow\u2019s high tide, as sea level rise will cause flooding to occur more frequently and last for longer durations of time.\nThe red layer in the map represents areas currently subject to tidal flooding, often called \u201crecurrent or nuisance flooding.\u201d\nClick on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings,  and advisories.\nCurrent Location\nHigh Tide Flooding\nHistorical Yearly Inundation Events\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\nUse the sea level rise snapshot to communicate potential impacts at the county level\nLake Level Viewer\nVisualize potential lake level changes and impacts for the U.S. Great Lakes\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\nMap people, places, and natural resources that are potentially exposed to coastal flooding\nTakeaways from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report\nWatch this video to explore four takeaways from the report and key actions that communities can take\nGet more sea level rise and inundation resources and tools from the Digital Coast.\nAbout Sea Level Rise Viewer v 3.0.0\nThe purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.\nThe data and maps in this tool illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction. Water levels are shown as they would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind-driven tides). The data, maps, and information provided should be used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The data and maps in this tool are provided \u201cas is\u201d without warranty to their performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated with the results and performance of these data is assumed by the user. This tool should be used strictly as a planning reference tool and not for navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.\nAdditional Resources\nLeveed Areas Disclaimer\nLevees are displayed as yellow lines, and enclosed leveed areas are displayed as a white stippled pattern.\nMajor federal leveed areas were assumed high enough and strong enough to protect against inundation depicted in this viewer, and therefore no inundation was mapped in these regions.\nMinor (nonfederal) leveed areas were mapped using the best available elevation data that capture leveed features. In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\nReducing the Effects of Urban Flooding in New York City Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 3 June 2023 Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding in New York City PRE-DECISIONAL DRAFT \u2013 Not for Public Distribution or Release (FEMA Footer) Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this publication do not necessarily reflect the views of FEMA.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9. New York University researcher installs a flood sensor on a traffic sign located on Sheridan Boulevard, near the Bronx River, in the Crotona Park section of the borough Source: NY1/Ari Ephraim Feldman Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 13 6.\nRecommendation This Technical Report briefly summarizes some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and initiatives. The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500].

These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions.

(https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level.

The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 (4/14/24) Gregg Ibendahl April 16, 2024 Week #15 prediction Kansas wheat estimate for 4/14/24 Yield range from 41.5 to 45.9 Predicted yield of 43.7 Introduction1 The USDA collects weekly crop conditions throughout the growing season. The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7",

These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F.

St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 (4/14/24) Gregg Ibendahl April 16, 2024 Week #15 prediction Kansas wheat estimate for 4/14/24 Yield range from 41.5 to 45.9 Predicted yield of 43.7 Introduction1 The USDA collects weekly crop conditions throughout the growing season.

Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7",

The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\u00a0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals\u2014expanding some and shrinking others.\u00a0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget\u2014how much sunlight\u00a0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat\u2014over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\u00a0temperature readings\u00a0to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\u00a0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\u00a0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The \"coolest\" month was November, which was 1.35 \u02daF (0.75 \u02daC) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)\u2013the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86\u00b0C (1.55\u00b0F) above the 20th century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F). This value is 0.13\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02\u00b0C (0.04\u00b0F) higher than the last year's (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014\u20132022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's\u00a02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\u00a0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\u00a00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\u00a0Celsius)\u00a0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 \u00b0F (0.18 \u00b0C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities\u2014burning fossil fuels and clearing forests\u2014add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (\"representative concentration pathways,\" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns. (right)\u00a0 Projected temperature increase relative to the 1901-1960 average depending on which RCP we eventually follow. Image by Katharine Hayhoe, from the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nAccording to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,\u00a0 models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.\nReferences\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2023).

The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield.

As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting.

Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R.

St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7Main Menu\nBreadcrumb\nClimate Change: Global Temperature\nYearly surface temperature compared to the 20th-century average from 1880\u20132022. Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\u00a0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals\u2014expanding some and shrinking others.\u00a0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget\u2014how much sunlight\u00a0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat\u2014over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\u00a0temperature readings\u00a0to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\u00a0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\u00a0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The \"coolest\" month was November, which was 1.35 \u02daF (0.75 \u02daC) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)\u2013the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86\u00b0C (1.55\u00b0F) above the 20th century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F). This value is 0.13\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02\u00b0C (0.04\u00b0F) higher than the last year's (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014\u20132022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's\u00a02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\u00a0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\u00a00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\u00a0Celsius)\u00a0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 \u00b0F (0.18 \u00b0C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities\u2014burning fossil fuels and clearing forests\u2014add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (\"representative concentration pathways,\" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns. (right)\u00a0 Projected temperature increase relative to the 1901-1960 average depending on which RCP we eventually follow. Image by Katharine Hayhoe, from the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nAccording to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,\u00a0 models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.\nReferences\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2023).

The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer.\nSummer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August.\nAs we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here\u2019s the outlook from NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September.\nThe U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September.\u00a0Much warmer\u00a0or\u00a0much cooler than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nOn August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above average temperatures across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above average precipitation along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest.\nThe precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September.\u00a0Much higher\u00a0or\u00a0much lower than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nIn addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I\u2019ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here\u2019s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the most likely outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found here.\nThe updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC\u2019s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With the expected arrival of La Ni\u00f1a somewhat delayed, it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry) can influence temperatures and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks.\nTemperature outlook favors more heat in the West, uncertainty in much of the East\nThe September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. (Well above average means \u201cin the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.\u201d) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with equal chance odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions.\nThe best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is \u201cequal chances\u201d along the coast.\nIt\u2019s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so \u201cequal chances\u201d is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month.\nPrecipitation outlook tilts wet in across the South, mainly dry across the North\nThe precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-\u201cequal chances\u201d forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough.\nBelow-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods.\nU. S. Drought area increases further during August\nThe amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing extreme and exceptional drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards.\nThe summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our\u00a0Data Snapshots Collection,\u00a0based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project.\u00a0\nRegionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north.\nDrought outlook mainly predicts persistence and development, but improvement across parts of the South\nU.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See\u00a0CPC version\u00a0for Alaska and Hawaii.\nWith above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.\nTo read the entire discussion of the monthly climate outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center, check out their\u00a0website.\nWe value your feedback\nHelp us improve our content\nRelated Content\nNEWS & FEATURES\nMAPS & DATA\nTEACHING CLIMATE\nCLIMATE RESILIENCE TOOLKIT\nStay Connected\nSecretary Naig: \u201cIowa Remained a Production Powerhouse\u201d\nDES MOINES, Iowa (Jan. 12, 2024) \u2013 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig commented today on the 2023 Iowa Crop Production Annual Summary released by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. The national summary and state summaries are released in January each year. \u00a0\n\u201cEven with all the weather challenges last year, Iowa remained a production powerhouse and that\u2019s a testament to the assistance of timely rains, the resiliency of Iowa farmers, and continuous improvements in genetics, traits, equipment, technology, production methods and many other innovations,\u201d said Secretary Naig.\u00a0\nDespite 2023 ending as the state\u2019s 22nd driest year on record, with 8 of the 12 months registering below normal precipitation and persistent drought continuing for a record 184 consecutive weeks and counting, Iowans once again produced a historically strong corn and soybean crop.2023 Iowa crop production highlights include:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 201 bushels per acre and 2.52 billion bushels of production, this year\u2019s Iowa corn crop ranks as the 4th highest yield and 5th largest production in state history and helped drive the national corn yield and production to all-time record levels.\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 58 bushels per acre and 573 million bushels of production, this year\u2019s soybean crop ranked as the 4th highest yield and 3rd highest production in Iowa history, contributing to the country\u2019s 4th highest yield and 7th largest soybean crop ever.Strong production requires continual efforts to build markets and promote conservation, both of which are top priorities for Secretary Naig and the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\u201cAs Iowa remains a pacesetter in innovation and crop production,\u00a0I'll continue to focus on protecting our essential natural resources like soil and water, and creating new markets and expanding existing markets locally, domestically and internationally,\u201d said Secretary Naig.Iowa Crop ProductionCorn for grain production in Iowa for 2023 was estimated at 2.52 billion bushels, according to the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service \u2013 Crop Production 2023 Summary.

These bears are divided into 19 subpopulations around the Arctic, with some containing fewer than 200 individuals and others consisting of more than 2,000.\n\n Polar bears' rapidly dwindling populations serve as a symbol of the climate crisis globally, but are they technically endangered? Their conservation status may surprise you. Learn more about polar bear populations, the threats these animals face, and what we can do to save them from extinction.\n\nDid You Know?\nPolar bears live in areas that fall under the jurisdiction of five countries: Canada (Labrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, Yukon); Denmark (Greenland); Norway (Svalbard, Jan Mayen); Russia (Yakutiya, Krasnoyarsk, West Siberia, North European Russia); and the U.S. (Alaska).\n  Are Polar Bears Endangered?  \nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n Polar bears are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, a designation they first received in 1982 and that was upheld by the latest assessment in 2015. They are protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, a multilateral treaty signed in 1973 by the five polar bear nations: Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the U.S. This agreement prohibits unregulated hunting of polar bears, including the use of aircraft or large motorized vehicles to hunt them. It compels member states to take appropriate actions to preserve the ecosystems that sustain polar bears.\n\n Although not technically endangered, the U.S. government has protected them under the Endangered Species Act since 2008, classifying them as threatened throughout their range. It's important to note that while these bears face potentially existential threats in some places, a few populations have rebounded in recent decades from overhunting in the last century, leading some people to argue polar bears are actually thriving.\n\n The late U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska was one of those people, saying in 2018 that \"there are now three times as many polar bears in the Arctic than there were in the 1970s,\" a claim that has periodically resurfaced since. According to the IUCN, it's not clear which way polar bear populations are swinging on the whole. World Wildlife Fund data from 2019 shows that more subpopulations are declining than are increasing. The largest subpopulations look to be stable.\n\nLaws Protecting Polar Bears\nCountries with polar bear populations have passed laws enacting various protections for the bears. In the U.S., polar bears are protected partly by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which prohibits the \"take\" of polar bears and other marine mammals without federal approval. They are also protected by the Endangered Species Act since being listed as a \"threatened\" species in 2008.\n  Limitations to the Data  \n Despite the encouraging rebound of some populations, there is little evidence to suggest polar bears are thriving overall. That's partly because there isn't enough long-term data on polar bears, especially for the northernmost regions.\n\n Those who doubt their current plight have claimed that only 5,000 polar bears were left in the 1960s, but that claim is largely contested by conservation experts.\n\n At least three polar bear populations are likely in decline, according to the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), but nine of the 19 subpopulations have insufficient data. There is too little data to even estimate population size for the three in decline.\n\n While their specific status is more muddled than the overall outlook for climate change itself, there is significant evidence to suggest many polar bear populations are in peril.\n\n  How Is Climate Change Affecting Polar Bear Populations?  \nFloridaStock / Shutterstock\n To understand why polar bears are threatened by climate change, you have to consider what polar bears eat and how they get their food. Polar bears are apex predators and a keystone species in their Arctic habitats, and their favorite food, by far, is seals. They specifically target ringed and bearded seals due to their high-fat content.\n\n Polar bears spend about half their time hunting, typically by stalking seals from the sea ice and ambushing when they surface to breathe. They often travel long distances and wait hours or days for a single seal, and while only a fraction of their hunts succeed, it's generally worth the trouble for such a fatty meal.\n\n Polar bears are considered marine mammals, but while they are excellent swimmers, they are no match for a seal in the water. Sea ice is therefore instrumental to their hunting strategy, and it's now declining due to rising Arctic temperatures, now warming at roughly twice the rate of the planet overall.\n\nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n Arctic sea ice naturally waxes and wanes with the seasons, but its average late-summer minimum is now shrinking by 13% every decade, according to the NOAA. The oldest Arctic sea ice\u2014frozen for at least four years, making it more resilient than younger, thinner ice\u2014is now in steep decline. Whereas it comprised about 16% of the total ice pack in 1985, it now comprises less than 1%, representing a loss of 95% over just 33 years.\n\n In 2020, Arctic sea ice reached its second-lowest extent since record-keeping began. This decline is alarming for several reasons: Arctic sea ice performs key services for the planet like reflecting solar heat and influencing ocean currents. It's even more directly important for polar bears, as less sea ice means fewer chances for them to catch seals.\n\nPosnov / Getty Images\n The effects of climate change vary by location, and sea ice decline seems to be affecting some bears more than others. Western Hudson Bay had roughly 1,200 polar bears in the 1980s, for example, but that has since fallen to 842, and as Polar Bears International (PBI) notes, trends in their body condition, survival, and abundance have been linked to sea ice conditions. Bears in Southern Hudson Bay have also suffered a 17% decline since 2012, according to PBI, and their body conditions have similarly been linked to a longer ice-free period.\n\n Most other subpopulations are either considered stable or lack sufficient data, but many will likely also face dire challenges from the loss of sea ice in their habitats. Some might be able to adapt, but their options likely will be limited. Even if they can exploit new food sources on land, they could face competition or conflict with established residents like brown bears and people.\n\n Polar bears are slow to adapt due to their low reproductive rate and long time between generations. That doesn't bode well given the speed of modern climate change, already happening too quickly for many species to keep up.\n\nPolar bears can live up to about 30 years, but environmental factors (melting Arctic ice, for example) can significantly decrease their lifespans.\nPolar bears are apex predators and a keystone species in the Arctic. Without them, animals like Arctic foxes and seagulls would lose a food source. Seals, reindeer, whales, and birds that polar bears eat would become overpopulated.\nThe best way to help polar bear populations today is to fight climate change\u2014both systematically and in your own life. Drive less, reduce your energy consumption, recycle, and swap some of your meat intake with locally grown veggies. If you have the means, consider donating to a charity like Polar Bears International.\n\"Polar Bear Facts.\" World Wildlife Fund.\nWiig, \u00d8., et al.\u00a0\"Ursus maritimus.\"\u00a0The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\u00a02015: e.T22823A14871490.\u00a0Accessed on\u00a015 June 2022.\n\"Arctic Report Card.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Program. 2021.\n\"Climate Change: Arctic Sea Ice Summer Minimum.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 2020.\n\"Arctic Report Card.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Program. 2018.\n\"Arctic Sea Ice Extent.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\"Are Polar Bears Endangered?\" Polar Bears International.\nObbard, Martyn Ernest, et al. \"Estimating the abundance of the Southern Hudson Bay polar bear subpopulation with aerial surveys.\" Polar Biology. 2015.\nFollow Us\nPolar Bear Population by Country 2024\nWorld Population Review\nContinentsCountriesWorld CitiesUS StatesUS CountiesUS Cities\nCategories\nX\nCategories\nAgricultureCrime/SafetyCultureEconomicsEducationEnvironmentFacts/TriviaFlagsGeographyHealthHistoryInfrastructure/EnergyLawManufacturing/MiningMilitaryPolitics/GovernmentPopulationSportsTech/BusinessTravel\n\nClick on a country for details.\nX\nPolar Bear Population by Country 2024\nGlobally, there are 19 recognized populations of polar bears in the Arctic, with an estimated 22,000 to 31,000 individual polar bears living in the wild. In addition, approximately 300 polar bears are held in captivity. However, the world's population of polar bears is on a decline, and some scientists fear they could become extinct by 2100. To protect these majestic creatures, the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing polar bears.\nA significant portion of the polar bear population resides in Canada, where two-thirds of all polar bears live. About 16,000 polar bears are spread across 13 provinces and territories, including Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Notably, Churchill, Manitoba, is known as the polar bear capital of the world due to its high concentration of these animals.\nIn the United States, Alaska is the only state with a polar bear population, estimated to be between 4,000 and 7,000 individuals. The polar bears in Alaska are primarily divided into two subpopulations: those in the Chukchi Sea, or Alaska-Chukotka, and the Southern Beaufort Sea.\nRussia is home to an estimated 26,000 polar bears, living on islands and the mainland coast. Wrangel Island, a UNESCO-protected nature reserve in Russia, is often referred to as a polar bear maternity ward. Additional polar bear populations in Russia are found in the Barents Sea region, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and the Far East Village.\nGreenland's fjords and glacial ice are also home to polar bears, though they are elusive and rarely seen. It's estimated that around 4,400 polar bears inhabit Greenland, with two protected areas, Melville Bay and Greenland National Park, supporting polar bear populations.\nThe Svalbard archipelago in Norway is another prime location for spotting polar bears, with an estimated population of around 3,000. Despite their remote habitats, polar bear encounters can sometimes be dangerous. Since the 1970s, there have been six recorded human fatalities due to polar bear attacks.\nMost polar bears in captivity are found in zoos, aquariums, and parks across Europe, North America, and Asia, contributing to conservation and education efforts about these iconic Arctic inhabitants.\n\nThe global polar bear population is estimated to be 20000-25000 individuals as of 2023, shared between all countries included in the species' range: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States, as well as in international polar regions.\nPolar bears often roam from one country's territory into another, particularly in the winter when the polar ice reaches its broadest spread. As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This Page",

As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This PageGraphing polar bear population estimates over\u00a0time\nI\u2019ve already commented on the 2013 update of polar bear population status released by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG).\nHowever, I thought it might be interesting to graph the changes in global population estimates over time (from 1981-2013) \u2014 not just the actual estimates from PBSG status tables (with their min/max error ranges) but those totals plus the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates that the PBSG have dropped from their accounts in recent (2005-2013) assessments: Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Queen Elizabeth Islands (now known as the \u201cArctic Basin\u201d), and Laptev Sea.\nIn 2001, those \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates contributed 5,000-5,400 bears to the global total, but now they\u2019re gone \u2014 no bears from those regions contribute to the official totals\u00a0listed on recent PBSG status tables.\nAdding those dropped estimates back into the global totals makes it possible to generate a graph in which the global estimates are truly comparable over time.\nTo see how the dropped estimates influenced the perception of population change over time, I\u2019ve also graphed the estimates given by the PBSG in their status tables. I\u2019ve combined the two into one image (Fig. 1, click to enlarge) to make comparison easy.\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below. The most recent numbers, added 31 May 2015, are here.\nUPDATE 26 March 2019: See \u201cLatest global polar bear abundance \u2018best guess\u2019 estimate is 39,000 (26,000-58,000)\u201d\n\nFigure 1. Upper graph uses totals reported in PBSG status tables, with min/max; Lower graph uses the same figures, but adds back in the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped 2005-2013. The 1960 figure * is a ballpark estimate\nWhat is apparent is that the global population of polar bears has not declined over the last 30 years, as the PBSG status tables indicate.\nAlthough it\u2019s true that the official estimates for 2005 and 2009 publicized by the PBSG (\u201c20,000-25,000\u201d) also indicated no recent change, the numbers listed on their status tables don\u2019t tell the same story. What\u2019s the point of insisting on supposedly more accurate \u201cscientific\u201d estimates if you don\u2019t use them to generate your official total?\nNote that the most recent status table released last week, for 2013, did not include a new total \u2014 if you wanted to know if the global total had changed (and if so, by how much), you had to add the figures up yourself. Nowhere on the PBSG website does it now list an official population estimate. What\u2019s that about?\n\nFinally, note that I\u2019ve included a ballpark estimate for 1960 that reflects international concern that many years of unregulated hunting had seriously depleted populations, as occurred for numerous other species (indicated as a broad range rather than a single figure). And while it is true that no one truly knows how many polar bears there were in 1960, it is also true that by that time, over-hunting had occurred on a large scale for decades, and that there were fewer bears then than there are now (see another discussion of that topic here).\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below:\nStatus of Canadian polar bear populations has been changed \u2013 more good news October 28, 2014\nW Hudson Bay polar bear population no longer \u201cdeclining\u201d \u2013 where are the headlines? October 29, 2014\nThe Politics of Polar Bears documentary [excerpt links]  September 3, 2014\nNOTES ON METHODS\nWhere the PBSG status table for any given year (list below) gives a total range of estimates (maximum and minimum), as in 2001, I\u2019ve used the PBSG totals. Where the status tables do not give a total for the maximum, minimum and average numbers (i.e., 2005, 2009, 2013), I\u2019ve used those listed in the first column of each table (Fig. 2 below, and upper panel of Fig. 1). For example, the min/max and average estimates (rounded to nearest 10) from the status tables for 2005-2013 are:\n2005 15,130-27,760 (average 21,420)\n 2009 14,220-25,160 (average 19,610)\n 2013 13,070-24,240 (average 18,349)\nFig. 2 Graph using the figures listed in PBSG status tables only.\nWhile I acknowledge that earlier estimates (from the 80s and 90s) used different methods than later ones, which may have made them less accurate, they were the \u201cbest available science\u201d at the time. The purpose of this exercise is to compare the PBSG published numbers from these documents:\n1981 8th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Anonymous 1985: Table 1)\n1993 11th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Wiig et al. 1995: Table 1)\n1997 12th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Derocher et al. 1998: Table 1)\n2001 13th Meeting \u2013 Nuuk, Greenland (Lunn et al. 2002: Table 1)\n2005 14th Meeting \u2013 Seattle, Washington (Aars et al. 2006: Table 1)\n2009 15th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Obbard et al. 2010: Table 1)\n2013 Online status update, posted February 14, 2014\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out previously, adjustments made to the PBSG status tables that dropped to zero estimates that had formerly been included in the global totals suggested that by 2009, the totals must actually have increased by 2650 to 5700 bears since 2001.\nSo to make the population estimates comparable over time, we really need to add back in the ballpark estimates for the Queen Elizabeth Islands (which includes any bears residing there and in the Arctic Basin, last estimated at 200 bears), East Greenland (2,000 bears) and the Chukchi Sea (2,000 bears)1, which were dropped in the 2005 and 2009 PBSG assessments, as well as the estimate for the Laptev Sea (800-1200 bears, dropped in 2013, discussed here).\n[I did not include adjustments for Barents Sea changes in this graph (as I did previously), to keep the comparison simple and because some people might not agree that the Barents Sea adjustment qualifies as the same kind of change as the dropped estimates]\nFigure 3. Graph using figures from the PBSG status tables plus \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped between 2005 & 2013.\nFootnote:\n1. Although the estimate for this region is indeed less \u201cscientifically\u201d accurate than those from regions that have been surveyed, it is very clear that large number of bears reside in the Chukchi Sea. For example, Rode and colleagues (Rode et al. 2014) used an estimate of 2,000 for the Chukchi Sea region (\u201cbased on extrapolation of den surveys\u201d) to argue that the Chukchi and the Southern Beaufort population of bears were of \u201csimilar size.\u201d PBSG biologists apparently like to have it both ways: ignore the Chukchi estimate when it doesn\u2019t suit them (for global estimates) but include it when they need it for statistical work.\nReferences\nAars, J., Lunn, N.

In addition, approximately 300 polar bears are held in captivity. However, the world's population of polar bears is on a decline, and some scientists fear they could become extinct by 2100. To protect these majestic creatures, the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing polar bears.\nA significant portion of the polar bear population resides in Canada, where two-thirds of all polar bears live. About 16,000 polar bears are spread across 13 provinces and territories, including Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Notably, Churchill, Manitoba, is known as the polar bear capital of the world due to its high concentration of these animals.\nIn the United States, Alaska is the only state with a polar bear population, estimated to be between 4,000 and 7,000 individuals. The polar bears in Alaska are primarily divided into two subpopulations: those in the Chukchi Sea, or Alaska-Chukotka, and the Southern Beaufort Sea.\nRussia is home to an estimated 26,000 polar bears, living on islands and the mainland coast. Wrangel Island, a UNESCO-protected nature reserve in Russia, is often referred to as a polar bear maternity ward. Additional polar bear populations in Russia are found in the Barents Sea region, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and the Far East Village.\nGreenland's fjords and glacial ice are also home to polar bears, though they are elusive and rarely seen. It's estimated that around 4,400 polar bears inhabit Greenland, with two protected areas, Melville Bay and Greenland National Park, supporting polar bear populations.\nThe Svalbard archipelago in Norway is another prime location for spotting polar bears, with an estimated population of around 3,000. Despite their remote habitats, polar bear encounters can sometimes be dangerous. Since the 1970s, there have been six recorded human fatalities due to polar bear attacks.\nMost polar bears in captivity are found in zoos, aquariums, and parks across Europe, North America, and Asia, contributing to conservation and education efforts about these iconic Arctic inhabitants.\n\nThe global polar bear population is estimated to be 20000-25000 individuals as of 2023, shared between all countries included in the species' range: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States, as well as in international polar regions.\nPolar bears often roam from one country's territory into another, particularly in the winter when the polar ice reaches its broadest spread. As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This PageGraphing polar bear population estimates over\u00a0time\nI\u2019ve already commented on the 2013 update of polar bear population status released by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG).\nHowever, I thought it might be interesting to graph the changes in global population estimates over time (from 1981-2013) \u2014 not just the actual estimates from PBSG status tables (with their min/max error ranges) but those totals plus the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates that the PBSG have dropped from their accounts in recent (2005-2013) assessments: Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Queen Elizabeth Islands (now known as the \u201cArctic Basin\u201d), and Laptev Sea.\nIn 2001, those \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates contributed 5,000-5,400 bears to the global total, but now they\u2019re gone \u2014 no bears from those regions contribute to the official totals\u00a0listed on recent PBSG status tables.\nAdding those dropped estimates back into the global totals makes it possible to generate a graph in which the global estimates are truly comparable over time.\nTo see how the dropped estimates influenced the perception of population change over time, I\u2019ve also graphed the estimates given by the PBSG in their status tables.

    "judge_reasoning": "Solution 1 calculates the new total polar bear population by taking the minimum estimate of Alaska's population in 2024 (4,000), increasing it by 50%, and then adding the Chukchi Sea population from 2009 (2,000). This results in a total of 8,000 bears. Solution 2, however, considers a range for Alaska's population in 2024 (4,000 to 7,000), applies a 50% increase to both ends of the range, and then adds the Chukchi Sea population to both results, giving a range of 8,000 to 12,500 bears. The final answer in Solution 2 is the midpoint of this range, 10,000. The two solutions differ in their approach and final numerical answer, as Solution 1 uses a fixed minimum estimate while Solution 2 uses a range and provides a midpoint as the final answer."

Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat\u2019s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world\u2019s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don\u2019t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef\u2019s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens\u2019 labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don\u2019t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don\u2019t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water\u2019s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\u00a0\u00a0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\nAccept cookies?\nWe use cookies\u00c2\u00a0to give you the best online experience and to show personalised content and marketing.

This is a sharp increase from the previous assessment, published in 2008, which found a third of corals were in danger of being lost.\nClimate change is the leading cause of the declines, with high temperatures causing corals to eject the photosynthetic algae that live in their tissues. These events, known as bleaching, are becoming more extreme and more frequent, and causing mass die-offs in reefs across the world.\nThe IUCN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Director General, Dr Grethel Aguilar, has called for strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions as the best option to protect these vital species.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis global coral assessment vividly illustrates the severe impacts of our rapidly changing climate on life on Earth and drives home the severity of the consequences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealthy ecosystems like coral reefs are essential for human livelihoods \u00e2\u0080\u0093 providing food, stabilising coastlines, and storing carbon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe protection of our biodiversity is not only vital for our wellbeing but crucial for our survival. Climate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nCorals get their colour from the photosynthetic algae that live inside them, as part of a relationship which has lasted for over 380 million years. \u00c2\u00a9 Alexandre.ROSA/ Shutterstock\nHow endangered are corals, and why are they important?\nThe results of the latest Red List are the latest reminder of the dangers that reef-building corals face, with the animals having become more threatened with every reassessment of their health.\nWhile Red List assessments have changed over the past 30 years, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated that just 13 coral species were considered Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered in the 1990s. By the time of the next assessment in 2008, this figure had risen to 231.\nIt has now risen again, by more than 100, meaning almost half of all corals are at significant risk of extinction. This makes corals proportionately more endangered than all the major animal groups on land, including amphibians, mammals and reptiles.\nIf these coral species do become extinct, their loss would cause major changes for life in the oceans. Coral reefs support around a quarter of all marine life, and so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that coral extinctions could cause losses among fish, crustaceans and many other groups.\nThe loss of coral reefs would also remove an important nursery habitat for fish, as the hard skeletons provide a safe area for small fish to grow up in, away from large predators. Fewer nursery habitats would likely mean fewer fish, impacting both predator populations and fisheries.\nThe economic impact of coral extinctions goes much further than fishing, with reefs estimated to prevent billions of pounds worth of damage from flooding and erosion every year by breaking up waves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also likely tourism would suffer, cutting off a vital source of income for many communities.\nThe most at-risk reefs are in the Atlantic, where half of all species are at risk of extinction and a quarter are Critically Endangered. In a separate paper, published in PLOS One, researchers have examined the threats facing these corals in particular.\nThe staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis is found in the Atlantic, and is considered Critically Endangered under the most recent Red List. \u00c2\u00a9\u00c2\u00a0Alberto Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez-Ram\u00c3\u00adrez\nWhy are Atlantic corals so threatened?\nWhile the vast majority of reefs are found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, around 10% are found in the Atlantic. These corals are very distinct from their relatives, having been separated from other corals by the joining of North and South America over three million years ago.\nIn total, 85 shallow-water coral species live in the Atlantic, with the most important hotspots found in the Caribbean and off the coast of Brazil.\u00c2\u00a0As study co-author Dr Nadia Santodomingo explains, the limited ability of these species to respond to the threats facing them means these reefs are more vulnerable to collapse.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAtlantic corals have been hit the hardest by reef decline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Nadia, a Curator of Fossil Cnidaria at the Natural History Museum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing a perfect storm of threats, of which climate change is just one part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese corals are being significantly impacted by overfishing, pollution and coral diseases which are more prevalent in the Atlantic than in other regions. As a result, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprised to see the results of the IUCN assessment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDisease has perhaps had the most dramatic impact on Atlantic corals, devastating not only the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corals but also the animals they depend on. An unknown illness is suspected to have killed as much as 98% of the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-spined sea urchins in the 1980s, meaning these grazers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent algae from dominating many reefs.\nNew diseases are continuing to emerge, with stony coral tissue loss disease first detected in 2014. The illness has spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean, killing as many as 94% of all infected corals.\nRising temperatures are also an increasing threat, with bleaching just the tip of the iceberg. Higher levels of carbon dioxide are making the ocean more acidic, making it harder for corals to grow their calcium carbonate skeletons. Climate change has also been linked with rising numbers of hurricanes in the region, which are washing away centuries-old reefs in a matter of hours.\nWhile the PLOS One study raises plenty of cause for concern, it also notes some reasons to be hopeful. After the devastating declines of the 1970s and 1980s, the researchers found that the fall in Atlantic coral cover appears to be getting smaller.\nTo support these green shoots of recovery, further research needs to be taken to understand how corals can adapt to the challenges that face them. As Dr Beth Polidoro, a co-lead author of the paper, explains, this must go hand in hand with urgent action to combat climate change and the other threats facing coral.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions alongside action to address local threats if we want to give coral reefs a chance to survive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Beth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy acting now, we can slow the pace of ocean warming and broaden the window of opportunity for corals to potentially adapt and survive in the long term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRead more\nDiscover oceans\nFind out more about why we need to protect oceans and read about the pioneering work of our marine scientists.\nRelated posts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoral reefs cover more of Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface than realised, new estimates reveal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSatellite images have revealed a missing 64,000 square kilometres of coral cover, an area similar to the size of Ireland.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver half of coral reef cover across the world has been lost since 1950\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCoral reefs have declined by over half since the 1950s as they suffer from the effects of climate change and overfishing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe resilient coral reefs surviving ocean warming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOcean warming is threatening coral reefs but some reefs are surviving the warming waters and offer hope for these vital ecosystems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighlighting coral reefs at risk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat can antique corals reveal about the impact of climate change on the ocean?\nDon't miss a thing\nReceive email updates about our news, science, exhibitions, events, products, services and fundraising activities.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

    "pred_reasoning": "Document1 states that there are 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S. in 2022. Document2 provides that there are 7.32 million people employed in hospitals. To find the number of employees per hospital, divide the total number of employees by the number of hospitals: 7,320,000 employees / 6,120 hospitals = 1,196.08 employees per hospital.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they extract the number of hospitals and the number of employees in millions, convert the number of employees to a whole number, and then calculate the average number of employees per hospital by dividing the total number of employees by the number of hospitals. The final numerical answers are also effectively the same, with Solution 1 providing a more precise answer (1196.078431372549) and Solution 2 rounding it to two decimal places (1196.08). The slight difference in precision does not affect the equivalence of the solutions in terms of reasoning and final answer."

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

This formula determines the occupancy rate, providing valuable insights into bed utilization. The occupancy rate is normally calculated for specific periods such as a month or a year.\nSecond, the bed occupancy rate (BOR) method assesses the ratio of occupied beds to available beds, expressed as a percentage. To calculate BOR, divide the number of occupied beds by the total number of beds and multiply by 100. This method effectively highlights the efficiency of bed usage within a hospital.\nThird, the turnover interval (TI) method, which measures the time between a bed becoming vacant and being filled by the next patient, helps in understanding bed availability and throughput. A shorter turnover interval indicates higher efficiency.\nFourth, the bed manager\u2019s tool (BMT) involves real-time tracking software that updates bed status and predicts future occupancy trends. This dynamic approach allows for better resource allocation and immediate response to capacity issues.\nAccurately assessing hospital bed capacity ensures optimal resource use and improved patient care.\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll explore the impact of accurate bed utilization on hospital operations and patient outcomes.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

Bed turnover rate is the average number of patients treated per bed during a specific time frame, typically over a day. A higher turnover rate indicates that beds are being used more frequently, which suggests a greater capacity for patient care.\nTo calculate bed capacity accurately, consider the following components:\nUnderstanding Bed Capacity: Bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care in a facility.\nCalculating Turnover Rate: Determine the bed turnover rate by dividing the total number of patient discharges by the number of available beds over a given period. This calculation provides insight into the utilization level.\nAdjusting Capacity Calculations: Incorporate the bed turnover rate into your bed capacity calculations. If the turnover rate is high, it implies that the facility can manage more patients in the same number of beds, indicating a need for higher capacity assessments.\nAnalyzing Operational Efficiency: A higher bed turnover rate may reflect operational efficiency and effective management of patient flow. This efficiency can lead to adjustments in staffing, resources, and space requirements, impacting overall capacity planning.\nForecasting Future Needs: Understanding the bed turnover rate helps in forecasting future bed requirements based on expected patient volumes. If the rate is consistent or increasing, the facility may need to plan for additional beds to meet demand.\nIn summary, the bed turnover rate provides essential data for calculating bed capacity in healthcare facilities. It informs how many patients can realistically be accommodated based on current usage patterns, staffing levels, and future demand projections. A careful evaluation of this rate supports strategic planning and enhances patient care services.\nWhat Role Does Average Length of Stay (ALOS) Play in Bed Capacity?\nThe Average Length of Stay (ALOS) plays a crucial role in determining hospital bed capacity. ALOS refers to the average number of days a patient spends in a hospital. It directly influences how many patients a hospital can treat within a given timeframe.\nKey aspects of ALOS related to bed capacity include:\nBed Turnover Rate:The bed turnover rate measures how frequently a hospital bed is occupied by different patients over a specific period. The length of stay impacts this metric. A lower ALOS typically results in a higher bed turnover rate, allowing hospitals to treat more patients. A study by the American Hospital Association in 2021 highlighted that hospitals with a lower ALOS had a bed turnover rate that was 15% higher than those with a longer stay.\nResource Allocation:Resource allocation refers to how efficiently a hospital staff and supplies are distributed to meet patient needs. Shorter ALOS can lead to a more balanced distribution of resources. For example, a 2019 report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services indicated that hospitals with shorter ALOS were able to operate more cost-effectively while maintaining staff efficiency, resulting in better patient care outcomes.\nResource Allocation:Resource allocation refers to how efficiently a hospital staff and supplies are distributed to meet patient needs.

Hospitals must carefully manage ALOS to enhance efficiency while ensuring adequate patient care.\nWhat Common Challenges Are Faced in Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves multiple common challenges, including variability in patient demand, inaccurate data reporting, physical constraints, and policy impacts.\nVariability in Patient Demand\nInaccurate Data Reporting\nPhysical Constraints\nPolicy Impacts\nVariability in Patient Demand: Variability in patient demand significantly impacts bed capacity calculations. Demand can fluctuate due to seasonal illnesses, pandemics, and local events. For instance, during flu season, hospitals may experience higher patient volumes than usual. A study by the American Hospital Association (AHA) in 2020 noted that hospitals often face sudden surges in patient intake, complicating their capacity planning.\nInaccurate Data Reporting: Inaccurate data reporting can lead to miscalculations of bed availability. Hospitals may underreport or overreport bed occupancy rates. A survey by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) indicated that discrepancies in data can stem from software issues, human error, or inconsistent definitions of what constitutes a \u2018bed\u2019. These inaccuracies can hinder effective resource allocation.\nPhysical Constraints: Physical constraints, such as hospital layout and infrastructure, affect bed capacity. Space limitations and outdated facilities may reduce the number of operational beds. A case study on a hospital in rural Michigan found that limited physical space constrained bed expansion despite increasing demand. This situation highlights the importance of infrastructure assessment in capacity calculations.\nPolicy Impacts: Policy impacts also play a role in bed capacity challenges. Regulations regarding staffing ratios and safety standards can dictate how many beds can be operational. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) imposes certain regulations that may limit bed capacity based on staffing availability. This can create discrepancies between actual and theoretically available capacity.\nUnderstanding these challenges can improve hospital management and enhance patient care during critical times.\nHow Can Hospitals Use Technology to Improve Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospitals can use technology to improve bed capacity calculations by employing data analytics, predictive modeling, real-time monitoring, and electronic health record integration. These technologies help optimize bed usage and enhance patient care.\nData analytics: Hospitals can analyze historical data to identify patterns in patient admissions and discharges.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "To find the average number of hospital beds per hospital in the United States in 2022, we need to divide the total number of hospital beds by the total number of hospitals. From the Long-Context Documents, we know that there were approximately 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S. in 2022. Additionally, the number of hospital beds in the U.S. in 2022 was 920,000. Therefore, the average number of hospital beds per hospital is calculated as 920,000 beds divided by 6,120 hospitals, which equals approximately 150.33 beds per hospital.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they calculate the average number of hospital beds per hospital by dividing the total number of hospital beds (920,000) by the total number of hospitals (6,120). The final numerical answers are also effectively the same, with Solution 1 providing a more precise value (150.32679738562092) and Solution 2 rounding it to two decimal places (150.33). The slight difference in precision does not affect the equivalence of the solutions in terms of reasoning and final answer."

Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family.

Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko.

Adequate staffing levels ensure that nurses can provide thorough and attentive care, which is essential for positive patient outcomes. Conversely, inadequate nurse-patient ratios can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality, nurse burnout, and reduced quality of care. As healthcare systems globally grapple with resource constraints and increasing patient demands, understanding the impact of nurse-patient ratios is paramount for policy-making and healthcare management. This paper reviews existing literature on nurse-patient ratios, examining their influence on healthcare quality and patient safety. The goal is to identify the key outcomes associated with varying staffing levels and propose strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to improve healthcare delivery [1].\nLiterature Review Research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between nurse-patient ratios and patient outcomes. Studies have shown that lower nurse-patient ratios are associated with decreased patient morbidity and mortality. That improved nurse staffing levels significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers, and patient falls. Nurse Job satisfaction and retention are also influenced by nurse-patient ratios. High patient loads can lead to increased stress, burnout, and job dissatisfaction among nurses. This not only affects the well-being of nurses but also impacts patient care, as high turnover rates can disrupt continuity and quality of care. Healthcare quality, as measured by patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, is closely tied to nurse staffing levels. Hospitals with adequate nurse-patient ratios tend to have higher patient satisfaction scores, as patients receive more personalized and timely care. Additionally, better-staffed units often experience fewer medical errors and higher adherence to clinical guidelines [2].\nDiscussion Optimizing nurse-patient ratios is essential for enhancing healthcare quality and patient safety. Several strategies can be employed to achieve this goal. First, implementing mandated staffing ratios, as seen in California, where legislation requires specific nurse-to-patient ratios in hospitals, can ensure a baseline standard for staffing levels. Research indicates that these regulations have led to improved patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction. Second, employing flexible staffing models that adjust to patient acuity and census can help manage workload more effectively. Utilizing data-driven tools to predict patient needs and adjust staffing accordingly ensures that resources are allocated efficiently. Third, investing in nurse workforce development is crucial. Providing ongoing education, career development opportunities, and supportive work environments can enhance nurse retention and attract new entrants to the profession. This, in turn, can help maintain adequate staffing levels [3].\nFinally, leveraging technology to support nursing practice can alleviate some of the burdens associated with high patient loads. Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telehealth, and other digital tools can streamline documentation, facilitate communication, and enhance care coordination, allowing nurses to focus more on direct patient care. Healthcare quality and safety are fundamental aspects of healthcare delivery that ensure patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Quality in healthcare refers to the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes consistent with current professional knowledge. Safety, a crucial component of quality, involves minimizing risks, errors, and harm to patients during the provision of healthcare services. Together, healthcare quality and safety form the bedrock of effective medical practice and patient care. A key element of healthcare quality is the implementation of evidence-based practices. These practices are rooted in the best available scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values. By adhering to evidence-based guidelines, healthcare providers can ensure that the treatments and interventions they offer are both effective and efficient. For instance, the use of standardized protocols for managing chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension has been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications. Similarly, adherence to surgical checklists has been proven to significantly decrease surgical errors and infections [4].\nPatient safety initiatives aim to create a safe healthcare environment by preventing and reducing risks, errors, and harm that can occur during patient care. These initiatives encompass a range of strategies, including the development of safety protocols, the use of technology to prevent errors, and the promotion of a culture of safety within healthcare organizations. For example, the implementation of Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems has been instrumental in reducing medication errors by ensuring accurate and legible prescriptions. Additionally, the use of barcoding systems Adv Practice Nurs, Volume 09:03, 2024 Page 2 of 2 Dela C.\nfor medication administration ensures that patients receive the correct medications at the appropriate dosages. A critical aspect of healthcare quality and safety is the continuous monitoring and improvement of healthcare processes [5].\nAnother vital component of healthcare quality is patient-centered care. This approach involves respecting patients' preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that they guide all clinical decisions. Patient-centered care emphasizes the importance of effective communication, shared decision-making, and providing compassionate and respectful care. By involving patients in their care, healthcare providers can improve patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment plans, and overall health outcomes. Healthcare quality and safety are also influenced by the work environment and culture within healthcare organizations. A supportive work environment that promotes teamwork, open communication, and continuous learning is essential for ensuring high-quality and safe patient care. Organizations that prioritize staff well-being, provide ongoing education and training, and encourage reporting and learning from errors is better positioned to deliver safe and effective care. Moreover, regulatory bodies and accreditation organizations play a significant role in promoting healthcare quality and safety. These entities establish standards and guidelines that healthcare organizations must adhere to and conduct regular inspections and evaluations to ensure compliance. Accreditation by organizations such as The Joint Commission signifies that a healthcare facility meets high standards of care and safety [6]. Conclusion The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. Adequate staffing levels are associated with better patient outcomes, higher nurse job satisfaction, and overall improved healthcare delivery. By implementing mandated staffing ratios, employing flexible staffing models, investing in workforce development, and leveraging technology, healthcare organizations can optimize nurse-patient ratios to enhance patient care and nurse well-being. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, prioritizing adequate nurse staffing will remain essential for ensuring high-quality, safe, and effective patient care.\nAcknowledgement None.\nConflict of Interest None.\nHow to cite this article: Dela, Christmal. \u201cThe Impact of Nurse-patient Ratios on Healthcare Quality and Safety.\u201d Adv Practice Nurs 9 (2024): 387.\nReferences 1.

However, accurately measuring this data can be challenging, and some organizations use limited methodologies that don\u2019t always reflect the quality of care or the varied factors that contribute to patient outcomes,\" the hospital system said in a statement.\nNBC Chicago reached out to a number of other hospitals listed in the ranking but did not receive a response. \nSome prominent Chicago-area hospitals were also among the \"C\" ratings on the list, including Northwestern Medicine's Lake Forest Hospital, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System, a number of OSF HealthCare facilities, Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and more.  \nNorthwestern Medicine said its Lake Forest Hospital \"is committed to providing high quality, safe, patient-centered care.\" \n\"Our physicians, nurses and staff are driven by their dedication and passion for delivering outstanding care while always striving to do what is better for our patients,\" the hospital said in a statement. \"We believe that quality and safety data should be meaningful, informative and transparent to the public. We appreciate the ongoing efforts by\u00a0Leapfrog\u00a0to improve the usefulness and accessibility of information for consumers.\"\nOSF HealthCare said 10 of its 15 hospitals received a grade in the report, one of which was given an A and five others given B's. \nIn total, four were given a C rating. \n\u201cOSF supports transparency about quality and safety information such as that provided through the Leapfrog grades and is committed to finding ways to improve safety and quality of care. We are proud of the work our Mission Partners (employees) do every day and how they have faced the many challenges of the past two years,\" the healthcare company said in a statement. \nIllinois ranked 28th in the U.S., with 26.5% of hospitals getting an \"A\" grade in the bi-annual report. In the spring, the state was listed at 27th. \nStill, in the fall of 2021, only 18 state hospitals were listed with an \"A\" grade. \nThe top-ranked state on the list was New Hampshire, followed by Virginia, Utah, Colorado and Idaho. \nHere's a look at which Illinois hospitals received an \"A\" grade: \nAdventHealth Bolingbrook - Bolingbrook, IL \nAdventHealth GlenOaks - Glendale Heights, IL\nAdventHealth Hinsdale - Hinsdale, IL \nAdventHealth La Grange - La Grange, IL\nAscension Mercy - Aurora, IL\nAscension Resurrection - Chicago, IL\nBlessing Hospital - Quincy, IL\nCarle Foundation Hospital- Urbana, IL \nElmhurst Memorial Hospital - Elmhurst, IL\nFHN Memorial Hospital - Freeport, IL\nHSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital - O'Fallon, IL\nLoyola Gottlieb Memorial Hospital - Melrose Park, IL \nMacNeal Hospital - Berwyn, IL \nMcDonough District Hospital - Macomb, IL \nMemorial Hospital Belleville - Belleville, IL \nMorris Hospital - Morris, IL \nNorthwest Community Hospital - Arlington Heights, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital - Winfield, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital - Geneva, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Huntley Hospital - Huntley, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Hospital - DeKalb, IL\nNorthwestern Medicine McHenry Hospital - McHenry, IL\nOSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center - Peoria, IL \nRush Copley Medical Center - Aurora, IL\nRush Oak Park Hospital520 - Oak Park, IL \nRush University Medical Center - Chicago, IL \nSilver Cross Hospital - New Lenox, IL \nSSM Health St. Mary's Hospital-Centralia - Centralia, IL \nUnityPoint Health - Proctor - Peoria, IL \nUniversity of Chicago Medical Center - Chicago, IL\nSee the full list of hospital grades in Illinois here. \nTrending Stories\nWeather Forecast\nOpen Access ISSN: 2573-0347 Advanced Practices in Nursing Mini Review Volume 09:03, 2024 Abstract The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. This review explores the relationship between nurse-patient ratios and various outcomes in healthcare settings, including patient morbidity and mortality, nurse job satisfaction, and overall care quality. By synthesizing current literature, the review highlights the impact of staffing levels on patient care and nurse well-being, and discusses potential strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to enhance healthcare delivery. This involves regular assessment of healthcare outcomes, patient satisfaction, and compliance with clinical guidelines. Healthcare organizations often use quality improvement methodologies, such as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles and Six Sigma, to identify areas for improvement, implement changes, and measure the impact of those changes. These methodologies provide a structured approach to problem-solving and facilitate the systematic improvement of healthcare processes.\nKeywords: Healthcare quality \u2022 Patient safety \u2022 Nurse job satisfaction \u2022 Healthcare delivery *Address for Correspondence: Christmal Dela, Department of Health Sciences, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa; E-mail: christmal.\nchristmals23@nwu.ac.za Copyright: \u00a9 2024 Dela C.

Adequate staffing levels ensure that nurses can provide thorough and attentive care, which is essential for positive patient outcomes. Conversely, inadequate nurse-patient ratios can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality, nurse burnout, and reduced quality of care. As healthcare systems globally grapple with resource constraints and increasing patient demands, understanding the impact of nurse-patient ratios is paramount for policy-making and healthcare management. This paper reviews existing literature on nurse-patient ratios, examining their influence on healthcare quality and patient safety. The goal is to identify the key outcomes associated with varying staffing levels and propose strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to improve healthcare delivery [1].\nLiterature Review Research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between nurse-patient ratios and patient outcomes. Studies have shown that lower nurse-patient ratios are associated with decreased patient morbidity and mortality. That improved nurse staffing levels significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers, and patient falls. Nurse Job satisfaction and retention are also influenced by nurse-patient ratios. High patient loads can lead to increased stress, burnout, and job dissatisfaction among nurses. This not only affects the well-being of nurses but also impacts patient care, as high turnover rates can disrupt continuity and quality of care. Healthcare quality, as measured by patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, is closely tied to nurse staffing levels. Hospitals with adequate nurse-patient ratios tend to have higher patient satisfaction scores, as patients receive more personalized and timely care. Additionally, better-staffed units often experience fewer medical errors and higher adherence to clinical guidelines [2].\nDiscussion Optimizing nurse-patient ratios is essential for enhancing healthcare quality and patient safety. Several strategies can be employed to achieve this goal. First, implementing mandated staffing ratios, as seen in California, where legislation requires specific nurse-to-patient ratios in hospitals, can ensure a baseline standard for staffing levels. Research indicates that these regulations have led to improved patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction. Second, employing flexible staffing models that adjust to patient acuity and census can help manage workload more effectively. Utilizing data-driven tools to predict patient needs and adjust staffing accordingly ensures that resources are allocated efficiently. Third, investing in nurse workforce development is crucial. Providing ongoing education, career development opportunities, and supportive work environments can enhance nurse retention and attract new entrants to the profession. This, in turn, can help maintain adequate staffing levels [3].\nFinally, leveraging technology to support nursing practice can alleviate some of the burdens associated with high patient loads. Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telehealth, and other digital tools can streamline documentation, facilitate communication, and enhance care coordination, allowing nurses to focus more on direct patient care. Healthcare quality and safety are fundamental aspects of healthcare delivery that ensure patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Quality in healthcare refers to the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes consistent with current professional knowledge. Safety, a crucial component of quality, involves minimizing risks, errors, and harm to patients during the provision of healthcare services. Together, healthcare quality and safety form the bedrock of effective medical practice and patient care. A key element of healthcare quality is the implementation of evidence-based practices. These practices are rooted in the best available scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values. By adhering to evidence-based guidelines, healthcare providers can ensure that the treatments and interventions they offer are both effective and efficient. For instance, the use of standardized protocols for managing chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension has been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications. Similarly, adherence to surgical checklists has been proven to significantly decrease surgical errors and infections [4].\nPatient safety initiatives aim to create a safe healthcare environment by preventing and reducing risks, errors, and harm that can occur during patient care. These initiatives encompass a range of strategies, including the development of safety protocols, the use of technology to prevent errors, and the promotion of a culture of safety within healthcare organizations. For example, the implementation of Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems has been instrumental in reducing medication errors by ensuring accurate and legible prescriptions. Additionally, the use of barcoding systems Adv Practice Nurs, Volume 09:03, 2024 Page 2 of 2 Dela C.\nfor medication administration ensures that patients receive the correct medications at the appropriate dosages. A critical aspect of healthcare quality and safety is the continuous monitoring and improvement of healthcare processes [5].\nAnother vital component of healthcare quality is patient-centered care. This approach involves respecting patients' preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that they guide all clinical decisions. Patient-centered care emphasizes the importance of effective communication, shared decision-making, and providing compassionate and respectful care. By involving patients in their care, healthcare providers can improve patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment plans, and overall health outcomes. Healthcare quality and safety are also influenced by the work environment and culture within healthcare organizations. A supportive work environment that promotes teamwork, open communication, and continuous learning is essential for ensuring high-quality and safe patient care. Organizations that prioritize staff well-being, provide ongoing education and training, and encourage reporting and learning from errors is better positioned to deliver safe and effective care. Moreover, regulatory bodies and accreditation organizations play a significant role in promoting healthcare quality and safety. These entities establish standards and guidelines that healthcare organizations must adhere to and conduct regular inspections and evaluations to ensure compliance. Accreditation by organizations such as The Joint Commission signifies that a healthcare facility meets high standards of care and safety [6]. Conclusion The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. Adequate staffing levels are associated with better patient outcomes, higher nurse job satisfaction, and overall improved healthcare delivery. By implementing mandated staffing ratios, employing flexible staffing models, investing in workforce development, and leveraging technology, healthcare organizations can optimize nurse-patient ratios to enhance patient care and nurse well-being. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, prioritizing adequate nurse staffing will remain essential for ensuring high-quality, safe, and effective patient care.\nAcknowledgement None.\nConflict of Interest None.\nHow to cite this article: Dela, Christmal. \u201cThe Impact of Nurse-patient Ratios on Healthcare Quality and Safety.\u201d Adv Practice Nurs 9 (2024): 387.\nReferences 1.

He\u2019s a primary care doctor and there aren\u2019t anywhere near enough of them in Big Bend.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one family physician for 5,000 patients in the Big Bend area right now. That\u2019s a delay of care,\u201d Billings told the House Public Health Committee of the Texas Legislature this fall. \u201cThat means sicker patients, that means more costly or care. That means less productivity. That means more death.\u201d\nThe federal government\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration classifies areas with fewer than one primary care provider for every 3,500 residents as Health Professional Shortage Areas, or HPSA\u2019s.\nBig Bend is definitely an HPSA, but according to research done by American Public Media Research Lab, Big Bend is hardly unique in Texas \u2014 and the pandemic isn\u2019t helping.\n\u201cIn 2019, 129 of Texas\u2019s 254 counties identified as a shortage area for primary care providers. As of this July 2021, that number jumped up to 228. So it increased by 99 counties,\u201d said Katherine Sypher, a data journalism fellow with the APM research lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are only five counties in Texas that didn\u2019t have any significant number of primary care physician shortages, four of those were Metropolitan,\u201d Sypher said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s also important to note that a lot of the counties in Texas that are experiencing these shortages are rural and already were experiencing a lack of health care providers to begin with.\u201d\nBack in Alpine, Billings said the primary care doctor shortage was hard enough to manage back before COVID, but the pandemic has been a body blow.\n\u201cSince February of this year, this area has lost five physicians; four family physicians in the area\u2019s only pediatrician. We lost a nurse practitioner, and we lost a physician\u2019s assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s seven primary care providers in this area, which represents over 50% of our physician workforce that covers this vast 12,000 square mile area that we serve in a population of about 25,000.\u201d\nBillings said providing medical care to a region the size of Big Bend is a team effort, but they don\u2019t have a deep bench. They don\u2019t have anyone to sub in when the team is overwhelmed.\n\u201cAt times, we had to shut down our behavioral health service line, our dental service line and our primary care service line in order just to focus on mass vaccination days, because that bench was empty,\u201d he said.\nThat has implications for people who need to say a doctor for a COVID test \u2014 or anything.\n\u201cWe\u2019re booking out now three weeks as our next available appointment in our practice and there are patients that that need to be seen they need to be seen today. And you know we\u2019re doing our best to try and squeeze them in and we tend to be overbooking ourselves.\u201d\nOn July 5, Big Bend Regional Medical Center had to temporarily close the only labor and delivery unit between El Paso and Del Rio \u2014 which are over 400 miles apart \u2014 because of a shortage of labor and delivery nurses.\nBillings said it\u2019s that kind of stress that is driving some primary care doctors out of the field \u2014 the stress of working so hard and still not being able to provide the care a community needs.\n\u201cThe acute pressure right now on our primary care system in our healthcare system is trying to deal with COVID, but the unintended consequences, years down the road are likely a worsening in the prevalence of these chronic diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to mention just the burnout of our healthcare workforce.\u201d\nRural Texans\u2019 access to healthcare is also reduced by lack of health coverage.

He\u2019s a primary care doctor and there aren\u2019t anywhere near enough of them in Big Bend.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one family physician for 5,000 patients in the Big Bend area right now. That\u2019s a delay of care,\u201d Billings told the House Public Health Committee of the Texas Legislature this fall. \u201cThat means sicker patients, that means more costly or care. That means less productivity. That means more death.\u201d\nThe federal government\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration classifies areas with fewer than one primary care provider for every 3,500 residents as Health Professional Shortage Areas, or HPSA\u2019s.\nBig Bend is definitely an HPSA, but according to research done by American Public Media Research Lab, Big Bend is hardly unique in Texas \u2014 and the pandemic isn\u2019t helping.\n\u201cIn 2019, 129 of Texas\u2019s 254 counties identified as a shortage area for primary care providers. As of this July 2021, that number jumped up to 228. So it increased by 99 counties,\u201d said Katherine Sypher, a data journalism fellow with the APM research lab.\n\u201cThere are only five counties in Texas that didn\u2019t have any significant number of primary care physician shortages, four of those were Metropolitan,\u201d Sypher said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s also important to note that a lot of the counties in Texas that are experiencing these shortages are rural and already were experiencing a lack of health care providers to begin with.\u201d\nBack in Alpine, Billings said the primary care doctor shortage was hard enough to manage back before COVID, but the pandemic has been a body blow.\n\u201cSince February of this year, this area has lost five physicians; four family physicians in the area\u2019s only pediatrician. We lost a nurse practitioner, and we lost a physician\u2019s assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s seven primary care providers in this area, which represents over 50% of our physician workforce that covers this vast 12,000 square mile area that we serve in a population of about 25,000.\u201d\nBillings said providing medical care to a region the size of Big Bend is a team effort, but they don\u2019t have a deep bench. They don\u2019t have anyone to sub in when the team is overwhelmed.\n\u201cAt times, we had to shut down our behavioral health service line, our dental service line and our primary care service line in order just to focus on mass vaccination days, because that bench was empty,\u201d he said.\nThat has implications for people who need to say a doctor for a COVID test \u2014 or anything.\n\u201cWe\u2019re booking out now three weeks as our next available appointment in our practice and there are patients that that need to be seen they need to be seen today. And you know we\u2019re doing our best to try and squeeze them in and we tend to be overbooking ourselves.\u201d\nOn July 5, Big Bend Regional Medical Center had to temporarily close the only labor and delivery unit between El Paso and Del Rio \u2014 which are over 400 miles apart \u2014 because of a shortage of labor and delivery nurses.\nBillings said it\u2019s that kind of stress that is driving some primary care doctors out of the field \u2014 the stress of working so hard and still not being able to provide the care a community needs.\n\u201cThe acute pressure right now on our primary care system in our healthcare system is trying to deal with COVID, but the unintended consequences, years down the road are likely a worsening in the prevalence of these chronic diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to mention just the burnout of our healthcare workforce.\u201d\nRural Texans\u2019 access to healthcare is also reduced by lack of health coverage. According to APM research lab, Texas has the highest uninsured rate among all states, with nearly 1 in 5 residents living without insurance. One reason for that is Texas is one of only 12 states who rejected the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That has led to rural hospitals closures, and, Billings said, exacerbated the primary care doctor shortage.\n\u201cI think the lack of Texas expanding Medicaid, is one of the big reasons why physicians \u2014 especially your primary care (physicians) \u2014 have left the state or have just retired,\u201d he said.\nBillings proposes what he calls the Texas Center for Rural Health Education\n\u201cThis center would be a training center of excellence for educating rural healthcare students, nurses, physicians, advanced practice clinicians, pharmacists, social workers, behavioral health workers, and public health professionals that are so lacking in our rural communities,\u201d he said.\nIf something doesn\u2019t change, the outlook is bleak. In May of 2020, early in the pandemic, the Department of State Health Services projected that the shortage of family doctors was likely to increase from just over a thousand in 2018 to nearly 2,500 in 2032.\nBillings does not believe those numbers are written in stone, however.

    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they extract the number of active physicians in California and the number of counties with a primary care shortage in Texas, then divide the number of physicians by the number of counties to find the average number of physicians per county. However, the final numerical answers differ slightly due to rounding. Solution 1 provides a more precise answer (550.7280701754386), while Solution 2 rounds it to 550.0.

One in 7 reports (14%) were associated with drug shortages (decreases in sales of \u226533%); supply disruptions increased for drugs with and without reports at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and returned to prepandemic levels after May 2020.\nMeaning\u00a0\r\n    These findings suggest that ongoing policy work is needed to protect US drug supplies from future supply shocks.\nImportance\u00a0\r\n    Drug shortages are a chronic and worsening issue that compromises patient safety. Despite the destabilizing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmaceutical production, it remains unclear whether issues affecting the drug supply chain were more likely to result in meaningful shortages during the pandemic.\nObjective\u00a0\r\n    To estimate the proportion of supply chain issue reports associated with drug shortages overall and with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\u00a0\r\n    This longitudinal cross-sectional study used data from the IQVIA Multinational Integrated Data Analysis database, comprising more than 85% of drug purchases by US pharmacies from wholesalers and manufacturers, from 2017 to 2021. Data were analyzed from January to May 2023.\nExposure\u00a0\r\n    Presence of a supply chain issue report to the US Food and Drug Administration or the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP).\nMain Outcomes and Measures\u00a0\r\n    The main outcome was drug shortage, defined as at least 33% decrease in units purchased within 6 months of a supply chain issue report. Random-effects logistic regression models compared the marginal odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports. Interaction terms assessed heterogeneity prior to vs during the COVID-19 pandemic and by drug characteristics (formulation, age, essential medicine status, clinician- vs self-administered, sales volume, and number of manufacturers).\nResults\u00a0\r\n    A total of 571 drugs exposed to 731 supply chain issue reports were matched to 7296 comparison medications with no reports. After adjusting for drug characteristics, 13.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-17.8%) of supply chain issue reports were associated with subsequent drug shortages vs 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.8%) of comparators (marginal odds ratio [mOR], 3.7 [95% CI, 2.6-5.1]). Shortages increased among both drugs with and without reports in February to April 2020 (34.2% of drugs with supply chain issue reports and 9.5% of comparison drugs; mOR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.1-11.6]), and then decreased after May 2020 (9.8% of drugs with reports and 3.6% of comparison drugs; mOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6-5.3]). Significant associations were identified by formulation (parenteral mOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.2] vs oral mOR, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.3-8.8]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.008), WHO essential medicine status (essential mOR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2] vs nonessential mOR, 4.6 [95% CI, 3.2-6.7]; P\u2009=\u2009.02), and for brand-name vs generic status (brand-name mOR, 8.1 [95% CI, 4.0-16.0] vs generic mOR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]; P\u2009=\u2009.002).\nConclusions and Relevance\u00a0\r\n    In this national cross-sectional study, supply chain issues associated with drug shortages increased at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing policy work is needed to protect US drug supplies from future shocks and to prioritize clinically valuable drugs at greatest shortage risk.\nDrug shortages have reached record highs.1 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a shortage as \u201ca period of time when the demand\u2026for the drug\u2026exceeds the supply.\u201d2 Shortages have been associated with missed or delayed dosages,3,4 medication errors,5,6 increased spending,7,8 and death.9 Shortages are caused by underreimbursement,10 quality concerns,11 and an overreliance on single-source production.12\nSince 2012, companies must report to the FDA known issues affecting the supply chain which could result in shortages (hereafter, supply chain issue reports).2 These reports are also tracked by the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP).13 Examples of supply chain issue reports include quality concerns (eg, microbial contamination) and unanticipated events that may impact production (eg, natural disasters).14 The FDA also publishes recalls and discontinuations. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with record numbers of supply chain issue reports.1,15 Despite these known risks, it is unknown how often supply chain issues were associated with subsequent shortages, ie, meaningful decreases in the national supply of a medication.\nAs the public health emergency ends, there is an imperative need for evidence regarding its impact on the drug supply chain to inform policies16-20 that protect patients from future, unanticipated shocks.21 The primary objective of our study was to quantify the proportion of all supply chain issue reports that were associated with drug shortages from 2017 to 2021. Our study adds to existing literature by comparing shortages during vs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and by drug characteristics. Our results provide evidence to inform policies to manage upstream events before they impact patients\u2019 access to life-saving treatments.\nWe conducted a population-based, longitudinal cross-sectional study of US prescription drug purchases from January 2017 to December 2021. Using public information from the FDA and ASHP, we identified medications with supply chain issue reports and matched them to drugs without reports. We selected supply chain characteristics based on a conceptual framework and compared the odds of shortages for each group. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved the study as not human participants research; therefore, the requirements for approval and informed consent were waived. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.\nDrug manufacturers are legally required to report known supply chain issues which could result in shortages (eg, inability to obtain raw ingredients) to the FDA; they report voluntarily to ASHP. However, supply chain reports may be incomplete indicators for meaningful decreases in national supplies (ie, shortages). As represented in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1, protective shields in supply chains,22,23 including opening more production lines, importing drugs from other countries, lengthening expiration dates,14,22 or using residual supplies,22 may address issues prior to the depletion of supplies held by manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies. Therefore, not all reported issues necessarily result in drug shortages.\nGiven these complexities and the known limitations of reporting, the purpose of our study was to quantify the proportion of supply chain issue reports that were associated with subsequent population-level shortages, both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Because there is no legal standard for meaningful decreases in supply, we defined shortages as decreases in purchased units of at least 33% within 6 months after the issuance of a new supply chain issue report. This threshold was chosen based on previous studies24 and is consistent with the FDA and ASHP\u2019s definitions of shortages, ie, significant decreases in national supply2 with the greatest potential to impact patient care.25 We accounted for non\u2013shortage-related supply chain factors by matching drugs exposed to reports to unexposed drugs without reports. We then compared subsequent odds of shortages (ie, \u226533% decreases in supply) for each group.\nOur study population comprised a longitudinal cross-section of drugs purchased in the US from 2017 to 2021 in IQVIA\u2019s Multinational Integrated Data Analysis (MIDAS) database. MIDAS comprises 85% of retail and 97% of nonretail purchases by pharmacies from wholesalers and manufacturers, based on unit volume.26 Data are reported in standardized units, defined as 1 pill, capsule, or vial or 5 mL oral liquid. We conducted our analyses on the drug formulation level. We excluded products with incomplete data, radiopharmaceuticals, unapproved products, allergens, antidotes, and over-the-counter products that are not fully captured in MIDAS. We also excluded topicals, since these may reflect different dosages that are difficult to compare with systemic formulations (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).\nOur exposed group comprised drugs with incident supply chain issue reports issued from January 2017 to September 2021 (3 months prior to data end). For each report, we defined the index date as the initial posting date by the FDA or ASHP. This included issues reported as being likely to result in shortages,2,13,27,28 FDA recalls,29 and discontinuations. Reports for the same drug-form were considered the same episode if they occurred within 90 days (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding recalls and discontinuations which may be indefinite.30\nWe performed exposure density sampling (EDS) to match each drug with a supply chain issue report (ie, exposed) with up to 10 comparison drugs with no reports at the time of exposure (ie, nonexposed).31,32 EDS is akin to sampling techniques for nested case-control studies,32-34 with the exception that matching is performed at the time of an exposure instead of the time of an outcome. This approach mitigated bias due to seasonality. When appropriately combined with multivariable adjustment for confounders, EDS leads to unbiased results.32 We did not match on baseline purchasing trends, since many reports were precipitated by abnormal demand increases.35 Drugs could appear more than once in either group. Drugs with reports could serve as at-risk comparators during any month without an active supply issue report.33\nMotivated by FDA\u2019s definition2 and based on previous studies,24 we defined meaningful shortages as at least 33% decreases in purchased units within 6 months after an incident supply chain issue report, compared with 3 months prior (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). This decrease is greater than what would be expected based on seasonal trends. We conducted secondary analyses of severe shortages, defined as decreases of at least 66%, as in previous literature.24\nWe used random-effects logistic regression models followed by marginal estimation to compare the odds of shortages for drugs with vs without supply chain issue reports. We included a random intercept for each matched set to account for potential dependency induced by matching. Our main estimates were the mean marginal odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports.34,35 We estimated absolute incidence by comparing the estimated probabilities of shortages in each group. A type 1 error rate of .05 was assumed, all hypothesis tests were 2-sided, and no adjustments were made for multiplicity. Analyses were conducted from January to May 2023 in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute), Stata version 16.1 (StataCorp), and RStudio version 4.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing).\nTo determine the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with US drug supply shortages, we included interaction terms to assess differential changes in the odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports before the pandemic (January 2017 to January 2020), in the first few months after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an emergency and when stockpiling occurred36 (February 2020 to April 2020), and in the first pandemic year (May 2020 to September 2021). We grouped issues based on their issuance date.\nTo assess the associations of supply chain characteristics with shortage incidence, we included interaction terms by formulation. We then used marginal estimation to compare odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports, within each form, eg, parenteral drugs with reports vs parenteral comparators. Additional interaction terms were added for other characteristics, including years since market entry and generic availability from the FDA National Drug Code Directory (August 2022),37 WHO essential medicine status (June 2022),38 and clinician- vs self-administration, defined using J-codes.39 We proxied supply chain redundancy using the number of manufacturers in MIDAS in the 6 months prior to a supply chain issue report. To capture market size, we adjusted for total sales in MIDAS during the same period (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of methodological assumptions. Because some shortages take longer to develop (eg, due to residual supply), we redefined shortages as decreases in supply within 9 months after report issuance. We assessed 5 (vs 10) matched comparisons, FDA and ASHP reports separately, and excluded recalls and discontinuations.30 Finally, we used nearest-neighbor propensity score methods to match drugs on month, formulation, class, clinician- vs self-administration, WHO essential-medicine status, at least 20 years since market or generic availability, at least 5 manufacturers, and at least $5 million in sales.\nPrior to inclusion criteria, there were 4142 drugs. As shown in Figure 1, 2276 drugs met exclusion criteria, resulting in a final sample of 1866 drugs. Among these, 571 drugs (31%) had 731 incident supply chain issue reports. These were EDS-matched to 1597 unique drugs without concurrent exposures; 717 reports were matched to 10 comparators and 14 reports had 9 comparators, for a total sample size of 7296 comparators.\nPer the Table, generic drugs were overrepresented in supply chain issue reports (616 reports [84%] vs 4397 comparison drugs [60%]), as were products at least 20 years old (375 reports [51%] vs 2434 comparison drugs [33%]), drugs with at least 5 manufacturers (378 reports [52%] vs 2225 comparison drugs [30%]), WHO essential medicines (316 reports [43%] vs 2199 comparison drugs [30%]), and drugs with less than $5 million baseline sales (234 reports [32%] vs 2158 comparison drugs [30%]). Manufacturers did not provide a reason for 264 reports (36%); the percentage of reports with unknown or unspecified reasons increased to 42% from February to April 2020 and 47% after May 2020 (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Across the entire study period, more than half of reports were recalls or discontinuations (498 reports [68%]), mostly due to quality concerns (Table; eTable 4 in Supplement 1).\nWe observed 15 to 71 incident supply chain issue reports per quarter from 2017 to 2021 (Figure 2). Across the study period, the mean change in drug purchases was \u22125.1% (95% CI, \u22128.2% to \u22122.1%) in the first quarter and \u22127.0% (95% CI, \u221214.7 to 0.01%) in the second quarter after report-issuance (Table). Among all reports, 113 reports (16%) were associated with shortages (\u226533% decrease) within 6 months vs 491 of 7290 unexposed comparison drugs (7%) (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). We observed an increase in comparison drugs with shortages in the first quarter of 2020 (Figure 2). Severe shortages (\u226566% decrease) were less common, with 63 reports (9%) and 188 comparison drugs (3%) associated with severe shortages (eTable 5, eFigure 4, and eFigure 5 in Supplement 1). Nonrecall and nondiscontinuation reports were more likely to be associated with meaningful (83 reports [23%]) and severe (43 reports [12%]) shortages, compared with recalls (meaningful: 13 reports [10%]; severe: 4 reports [3%]) and discontinuations (meaningful: 48 reports [13%]; severe: 33 reports [9%]) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1).\nMarginal odds ratios (mORs) and estimated probabilities from our logistic regression analysis are shown in Figure 3, with full regression output in eTable 6 in Supplement 1. Across baseline drug characteristics, the marginal estimated percentage of supply chain issue reports associated with shortages was 13.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-17.8%) of reports vs 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.8%) of comparators (Figure 3). Compared with drugs without reports, drugs with reports had greater marginal odds of shortages (mOR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.9-5.1]). Results were similar for severe shortages (mOR, 6.3 [95% CI, 3.7-10.9]), although adjusted incidences were lower (6.0% [95% CI, 3.8%-9.2%] for supply chain issue reports and 1.0% [95% CI, 0.7%-1.4%] for comparison drugs) (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).\nAs shown in Figure 3, the adjusted incidence of shortages for supply chain reports issued in the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be associated with subsequent shortages than reports issued during the prepandemic period (34.2% [95% CI, 18.6%-54.1%] vs 13.7% [95% CI, 10.0%-18.5%]). However, we also observed increases in the adjusted proportion of comparison drugs without reports with shortages at or above our 33% cutoff compared with the prepandemic period (9.5% [95% CI, 7.2%-12.5%] vs 4.0% [95% CI, 3.3%-4.7%]). There were no significant interactions by COVID-19 pandemic period. The 95% CIs of the mORs comparing drugs with vs without reports issued from February to April 2020 overlapped with the prepandemic period (prepandemic mOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.6-5.6] vs February to April 2020 mOR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.1-11.6]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.60). The mOR for drugs with vs without reports issued during or after May 2020 also did not significantly differ from the prepandemic period (mOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6-5.3]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.38) (Figure 3). The association between report status and severe shortages did not significantly differ during the prepandemic period (mOR, 6.8 [95% CI, 3.6-12.4]) vs during the early stage of the pandemic (February to April 2020: mOR, 5.9 [95% CI, 1.3-26.3]) or after May 2020 (mOR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.4-11.8]) (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).\nFigure 4 summarizes our assessment of heterogeneity by drug characteristics. Across other characteristics, we observed a significant interaction for parenteral drugs with vs without reports, compared with oral drugs (parenteral mOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.2] vs oral mOR, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.3-8.8]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.008). There were also significant interactions by WHO essential medicine status (essential mOR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2] vs nonessential mOR, 4.6 [95% CI, 3.2-6.7]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.02), and for brand-name vs generic drugs (brand-name mOR, 8.1 [95% CI, 4.0-16.0] vs generic mOR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.002). We observed similar heterogeneity for severe shortages  (eFigure 7 in Supplement 1).\nAs shown in eFigure 8 and eTables 7 to 11 in Supplement 1, sensitivity analyses were consistent with our main findings. Excluding recalls and discontinuations resulted in a slightly higher adjusted incidence of shortages (16.7% [95% CI, 12.9%-21.4%]); however, the marginal odds of shortage were similar (mOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-5.4]).\nIn this national cross-sectional study, approximately 1 in 7 supply chain issue reports (14%) were associated with drug shortages within 6 months, and 1 in 15 supply chain issue reports (6%) were associated with severe shortages. The incidence of shortages increased to 1 in 3 reports (34%) from February to April 2020 and then reduced to prepandemic levels after May 2020. However, we also observed increases in shortages in drugs with no supply chain issues during the early pandemic. WHO essential and parenteral medicines were less likely to be associated with shortages, and brand name drugs were more likely to be associated with shortages.\nOur findings are mostly consistent with a similar RAND study in MIDAS from 2016 to 2019.30 In that study, utilization decreased by a mean of 8.4% in the quarter after a supply chain issue report vs 5.1% in our study. Our smaller absolute estimate may be due to a lower incidence of shortages after May 2020. Nevertheless, our study is an important contribution to the literature because we included recalls and discontinuations, which were less likely to be associated with shortages. We also tested whether shortages changed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn our study, drugs with and without reports from February to April 2020 were more likely to be associated with subsequent shortages, compared with prepandemic rates. These findings are consistent with the known destabilizing impact of COVID-19 on supply chains. We observed a return to prepandemic levels after May 2020. This finding may be explained by the implementation of new policies that empowered the FDA to take more direct action.16,40,41 Despite these improvements, ongoing vulnerabilities in drug supply chains are in need of policy action,17 including greater supply chain transparency19,21 and addressing root economic causes of shortages.42\nIt is also possible that issuance of an FDA or ASHP report, while consistently associated with higher odds of shortages, may have underestimated relevant upstream issues at pandemic start. Before the pandemic, 4% of drugs with no report were associated with shortages at or above our 33% decrease cutoff; this increased to 10% from February to April 2020. We also observed a greater proportion of supply chain issues with no or unspecified reasons during the pandemic vs the prepandemic period. Temporary pauses in quality assurance reviews during COVID-19 lockdowns may have been associated with underreporting. There are no penalties for failure to report.22 Our wide 95% CIs for February to April 2020 should be interpreted with caution, given the small sample size (57 reports) and potential underreporting.\nWhen examining variation across drugs, we observed a higher mOR for the association between having a report and subsequent shortage among branded medications. This finding is not unexpected, given that branded markets usually have 1 supplier. The higher mOR among branded medications may therefore be explained by the unavailability of alternative manufacturers to supply product. Shortages of branded drugs may also respond to different underlying reasons, such as increased demand, quotas, or manufacturer capacity.43,44 In contrast, approximately 4 in 5 supply chain issue reports in our study were for generic medications, and one-third were for drugs with prereport sales less than $5 million. Generic supply chain issues likely involve insufficient incentives for manufacturers to invest in resilient supply chains for products of limited profitability.11,41 In this context, recent policy proposals suggest the implementation of reimbursement models which would provide add-on payments for generics manufactured in more resilient supply chains.42,45 Our findings of differing shortage risk by supply chain characteristics could be used to develop lists of high-priority generic drugs for the application of these novel reimbursement models. Our findings may also be informative for the development of shortage-critical lists to prioritize medications for other drug shortage policies,22,46 like those in Canada and Europe.47,48 Similar frameworks have not yet been adopted in the US but would be useful in the prioritization of national drug shortage policy.49\nInterestingly, we observed a lower mOR for the association between having a report and subsequent shortage for parenteral vs oral drugs. Changes in demand for these products, eg, cancellation of elective surgeries, may have resulted in residual supply during the pandemic. A higher proportion of parenteral drugs without supply chain reports were also associated with meaningful decreases in supply at or above our 33% cutoff, eg, 7% of parenteral vs 3% of oral drugs, suggesting that it is also possible all parenteral products were more vulnerable to disruption, lessening the difference between exposed vs unexposed drugs.11,41 Generic sterile injectables have therefore been prioritized in several recent drug shortage policy proposals.42,45\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the observed increase in drugs without supply chain issue reports that experienced shortages from February to April 2020 suggests potential for underreporting during the COVID-19 shutdown. Our mORs comparing drugs with vs without reports from February to April 2020 should be interpreted with caution. Our dataset was also time-limited (2017-2021). Many pandemic-related policies were not yet fully implemented, and we could not assess the association of the end of the public health emergency in May 2023.50 Second, although MIDAS is the most comprehensive dataset available, it does not fully capture over-the-counter and topical products, many of which have recently been experiencing shortages. Third, we do not know the downstream impact of the identified shortages on patients. Bedside efforts and availability of therapeutic alternatives may maintain standards of care, even when shortages occur.22 ASHP includes information on equivalents for some drugs; however, this information was lacking in FDA databases.\nThis cross-sectional study found that 1 in 7 supply chain issue reports were associated with drug shortages. Although the shortages increased early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a return to prepandemic levels after May 2020. As the public health emergency ends, continued policy effort is needed to mitigate shortages and to prepare pharmaceutical supply chains for future, unanticipated shocks.\nAccepted for Publication: January 29, 2024.\nPublished: April 5, 2024. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.4246\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2024 Callaway Kim K et al.

Bookwalter, PharmD, BCPSClinical PharmacistWomack Army Medical CenterFort Bragg, North Carolina\n\nUS Pharm. 2021;46(2):25-28.\nABSTRACT: The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused anticipatory purchasing of medications around the world, driving demand to an unprecedented high. Meanwhile, drug factories shut down in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the drug-supply chain was disrupted, and drug shortages resulted. In the face of these drug shortages, pharmacy personnel responded by initiating local policy changes, implementing detailed antibiotic stewardship, and enacting quantity limits for in-demand medications. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s a shortage of everything\u2019: Pharmacies in New York City struggle to keep key medications stocked amid coronavirus outbreak.\u201d1 \u201cCoronavirus pandemic is causing \u2018unacceptable\u2019 shortages in US drug supplies.\u201d2 These headlines and many others have overwhelmed news outlets, social media, and general conversation among the American public for months. When pharmacy personnel hear about drug shortages, panic, fear, and frustration begin to set in. Pharmacy\u2019s primary responsibility is to supply patients with life-saving medications. When drugs run out, pharmacy personnel may feel responsible for failing to supply the patient with a life-saving pharmaceutical. Accordingly, when pharmacy professionals encounter drug shortages, there is a call to action to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by purchasing available product, looking for alternatives, implementing protocols to save stock, and finding creative solutions to conserve valuable resources. The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the difficulties inherent in having a global drug-supply chain and has caused an increase in global demand for certain medications. It is imperative for pharmacists to understand the causes of drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, key medications affected at this time, and how to ensure patient safety during a shortage.\nCauses of Drug Shortages\nDrug shortages have been an ongoing problem for the medical community for decades; however, drug-shortage concerns have been exacerbated by this worldwide pandemic. Drug manufacturing follows standard business practices in order to make a profit. Excess stock in the warehouse is risky from a business standpoint. It costs money to store and maintain product in anticipation of sales and profit. Therefore, businesses may operate on a just-in-time model by manufacturing the product when it is needed in order to keep costs down and maintain efficiency. With no on-hand reserve, if anything alters supply or increases demand, a shortage can occur.3\nThe supply of goods to the market directly relates to the quantity of goods coming off the production lines over a given time. In order to produce a drug, raw materials must be acquired. The drug-manufacturing process is wholly dependent on the supplier of the raw materials. Often, there are multiple manufacturers for a drug, but there may be only one producer of the raw material. Therefore, any interruption in the supply of the raw material will affect all manufacturers of the drug.4 Currently, about 80% of the raw materials for drugs are imported from abroad, making the American drug supply highly dependent on other countries.4\nEven when adequate raw materials are available, there is a maximum capacity or a limited number of units that can be manufactured at a given time. Because the FDA approves a specific manufacturing line to produce a specific drug at a specific facility, a manufacturer cannot set up additional production of a drug in short supply elsewhere in the facility.4 Further limitations to production include the good manufacturing practices, chemical reactions, and in-process controls that must be in place to turn out a quality product.5\nThe spread of COVID-19 to the level of a global pandemic impacted the acquisition of raw material and caused manufacturing shutdowns around the world. China is a major source of active pharmaceutical ingredients, finished dosage forms, and raw materials.6 In response to COVID-19, roughly 37 pharmaceutical factories in China that manufactured active ingredients for U.S. drug products were shut down.7 Consequently, manufacturers in other parts of the world were forced to depend on current stock or find alternative supply sources. India, which imports roughly 70% of its raw materials from China and is the world\u2019s largest producer of generic drugs, began to experience delays in receiving ingredients and could not keep up with global demand under these conditions.7 In anticipation of drug shortages, the Indian government restricted the exportation of medications to other parts of the world in order to prevent a potential shortage in its own country.7 The limiting of drug exports from India amplified shortages in other areas of the world that depend on that supply.\nWith factory doors closed and COVID-19 a global threat, supplies start to run low. Not knowing when and where the next COVID-19 surge will occur, everyone is trying to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by managing the inventory of critical drugs required for providers to adequately treat the virus. As soon as evidence surfaces to support a potential treatment, pharmacies begin procuring the drug, and global demand starts to increase. Some drugs that have been in high demand in association with COVID-19 include albuterol metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and sedation medications.\nDrugs in Demand for COVID-19 Treatment\nAlbuterol MDIs: Treatment of COVID-19 often involves the use of bronchodilators owing to the specific lung cells targeted by the virus. Given that nebulizers increase the generation of aerosolized virus in COVID-19 patients and potentially escalate the spread of the virus, MDI use is preferred. Inhaler shortages are occurring because of increased demand by hospitals for treatment of COVID-19.8 To combat potential shortages, hospitals can conserve supply by creating local policies that would allow patients to bring their inhaler supply from home to use during their inpatient stay.9 Another way to conserve supply is when an inpatient pharmacy dispenses an inhaler for hospital use, then gives it to the patient upon discharge, eliminating the need for the patient to obtain a new prescription from the outpatient pharmacy.9 The possibility of using one MDI for multiple patients has been discussed. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) currently recommends against a common MDI-canister protocol.9 Common canister protocol involves using the same MDI for multiple patients by disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece with an alcohol pad before inserting it into a patient-specific spacer with a one-way valve, administering the medication, and disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece after use.9 Studies have found rates of bacterial contamination on the disinfected mouthpiece of up to 5%.9 The ISMP states that using a common canister for patients on isolation or those who are immunocompromised may not be appropriate and that the methods in previous studies have been aimed at preventing bacterial contamination, which would not be applicable to COVID-19.9 Given the elevated demand for MDIs because of COVID-19, it is imperative that pharmacists consider their current inventory and plan to conserve supplies if needed.\nAzithromycin: Azithromycin has been used as adjunctive therapy to provide antibacterial coverage and potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of some viral respiratory tract infections.10 Many trials are testing the effect of azithromycin in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.10 The increasing number of reports on azithromycin has led to an increased demand for the drug. On April 14, 2020, the FDA reported that there was currently a shortage of azithromycin owing to high demand.11 Although the intention to acquire supplies to keep on hand in case of a COVID-19 surge is laudable, it is important to remember that in 2018 the United States dispensed 38.5 million azithromycin prescriptions for conditions other than COVID-19.12 In order to reserve a supply of azithromycin, it is imperative that pharmacists practice good antibiotic stewardship and ensure that patients who receive azithromycin have an appropriate indication. In the U.S. alone, the CDC estimates that at least 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, commonly being written for viral respiratory infections when therapy is not indicated.13 Some other examples of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing include the use of non\u2013first-line antibiotics and the use of an antibiotic with excessively broad-spectrum activity for which a narrow-spectrum drug could be substituted.13 Pharmacists should review all azithromycin prescriptions to ensure that there is a proper indication and, when appropriate, recommend other proven therapy alternatives in order to help conserve the azithromycin supply.\nHydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are indicated for a very small population of patients with uncommon conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria. Therefore, typical purchasing quantities are minimal. However, COVID-19 research involving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has heightened the demand for these drugs. Many small trials began testing the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients because their mechanisms of action include targeting of lysosome, which can control graft-versus-host disease; inhibition of entry of the virus; prevention of virus cell fusion; anti-inflammatory effects; and reduction of cytokine storm.10 On March 20, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile to be used by licensed healthcare providers to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19.14 An analysis of outpatient retail pharmacy transaction data found that the prescribing of these drugs increased from 383,435 prescriptions in February 2020 to 759,186 prescriptions in March 2020.14 With demand doubling over 1 month, shortages followed, and the FDA published information on the shortages on March 31, 2020.15 In response, certain state boards of pharmacy established new rules to control use by requiring a diagnosis for the indicated disease to be written on the prescription, placing quantity limits for COVID-19 prescriptions, and restricting refills.16 On June 15, 2020, the FDA rescinded its EUA because the federal COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 and noted that, at the time, no medication could be recommended for COVID-19 preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis outside the clinical-trial setting.14 Following the release of this information, dispensing trends began to return to prepandemic levels, and the shortage resolved in late June 2020.14\nSedation Medications: COVID-19 can result in acute respiratory distress, and in extreme cases it requires the use of mechanical ventilation. Anticipation of an increase in mechanically ventilated patients and heightened demand for analgesics, sedatives, and paralytics created the perfect conditions for drug shortages. One way to save drug product is to minimize waste. Inpatient pharmacies should consider purchasing or compounding smaller drug volumes, when applicable, in order to minimize waste. Pharmacists should also review current hospital protocols and work with key stakeholders to make contingency plans for shortages of sedation medications. Traditionally, IV administration of opioids is preferred in mechanically ventilated patients; however, to conserve resources and keep opioid use to a minimum, hospitals can establish protocols for intermittent bolus analgesia, enteral administration of opioids, or implementation of adjuvant therapies.17 In ventilated patients, light sedation\u2014which helps conserve drug supply\u2014is preferred over deep sedation.17 Nonbenzodiazepine sedatives such as propofol and dexmedetomidine are preferred, but contingencies should be put in place to use other agents, such as ketamine, benzodiazepines, and pentobarbital.17 Awakening trials with reassessment of sedation needs should be performed daily. This practice may result in a reduction in sedation requirements while effectively conserving drug supply.17 In addition to analgesics and sedatives, some patients with COVID-19 will require paralytics. In order to conserve resources, hospital guidelines should be established for the use of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus use of paralytic agents.17 In general, when a drug shortage arises, it is imperative that pharmacists familiarize themselves with all alternative products and assist in creating contingency plans.\nPatient Safety During a Drug Shortage\nA drug shortage commonly requires the substitution of an item that is ordered, prepared, or dispensed differently than the standard product. When prescribing practices switch to less-familiar alternative agents\u2014especially those that are less efficacious, have a worse adverse-effect profile, or require an unusual or difficult dosing regimen\u2014medication errors are more likely to occur.18 To minimize medication errors and maximize patient safety, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines on managing drug-product shortages recommend implementing a drug-product shortage team, creating a resource-allocation committee, and establishing a process for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations.18 The product-shortage team would have multiple responsibilities, including the purchasing of alternative agents, decisions on conserving or rationing supplies, implementation of technology updates, and communication of changes.18 The resource-allocation committee would create a framework for rationing drug resources in advance, thereby eliminating the need for bedside decisions during a shortage.18 The final ASHP recommendation is to have a process in place for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations. A multidisciplinary team would be responsible for establishing ethical procedures and protocols before they are needed in order to ensure that the rationing of life-saving drugs reflects the fundamental healthcare principles of justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence.18\nThe overarching recommendation for preventing medication errors and ensuring patient safety is to focus on communicating information about the drug shortage. Communication updates should include all pertinent information about the shortage, such as the drug affected and the substitution or rationing plan.18 If a new drug is being selected, educational references about prescribing differences should be distributed, and pharmacists should be prepared to answer questions about the new agent. When information is being disseminated, it is important to include all potential stakeholders across all shifts. With drug shortages on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that the pharmacy profession take a proactive leadership role in developing and implementing processes to address drug shortages and ensure patient safety.\nConclusion\nThe pharmacy profession has been dealing with drug shortages for years. However, no past experience could have adequately prepared pharmacists for the drug shortages and unprecedented high demand resulting from the extensive disruptions caused by COVID-19. The pandemic crippled the global drug-supply chain by leading to factory closings, limited access to raw materials, and altered import and export rates of final dosage forms. With an inadequate supply chain and high demand worldwide, prescription drug shortages became a common topic in the pharmacy realm. Fear of not having enough supplies to battle the virus motivated pharmacy personnel to change current practices by initiating local policy changes, focusing on antibiotic stewardship, and implementing quantity limits in order to conserve drug stock. Overall, the need to combat historic drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to innovation and critical thinking in an effort to conserve valuable supplies without sacrificing patient safety under less-than-ideal circumstances. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\nREFERENCES\n1.

    "pred_reasoning": "From the Long-Context Documents, it is stated that there were 113 drug shortages associated with supply chain issue reports from 2017 to 2021. Additionally, the number of hydroxychloroquine prescriptions increased from 383,435 in February 2020 to 759,186 in March 2020. The increase in prescriptions is calculated as 759,186 - 383,435 = 375,751. Therefore, the ratio of the number of drug shortages to the increase in hydroxychloroquine prescriptions is 113 to 375,751. To find the ratio, we divide 113 by 375,751, which gives approximately 0.0003007.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they calculate the increase in hydroxychloroquine prescriptions by subtracting the February 2020 value from the March 2020 value, and then they compute the ratio of drug shortages to this increase. The final numerical answers are also identical, with Solution 1 providing a more precise value (0.0003007310692453247) and Solution 2 rounding it to 0.0003007. The slight difference in precision does not affect the equivalence of the solutions."

Even the \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008, which affected trade in many other products, did not cause a fall in exports or imports. With exports increasing more than imports, the trade surplus increased from C 18 billion in 2002 to a record high of C 174 billion in 2022 but fell to C 158 billion in 2023.\nFigure 1: EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Increasing share in total trade In 2023, the share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade was 7.8% with the share for imports (4.7%) much smaller than the share for exports (10.8%). Between 2002 and 2008 these shares remained fairly stable (Figure 2). In 2009, the share of imports increased by 1.3 percentage points (pp) and exports by 1.6 pp.\nThis was not caused by an increase in trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products but rather by the decline in total trade. Since 2009, the shares have been \ufb02uctuating but there is a clear overall growth.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 2 Figure 2: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade, 2002-2023 (% in total trade) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) United States and Switzerland remain the top EU partners The United States stands out as the EU\u2019s main trading partner for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 (Figure 3). Exports to the United States (33 %) were almost a third of all EU exports and were followed at some distance by Switzerland (15 %) and China (8 %). Imports to the EU were dominated even more by the United States (39 %) and Switzerland (32 %) followed by the United Kingdom (7 %). Since the United States and Switzerland are by far the two largest trade partners, the development of their trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products with the EU is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 3 Figure 3: Main EU partners for trade of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade with the United States and Switzerland between 2002 and 2023 Figure 4 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and the United States from 2002 to 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, imports from the United States increased by 19.3% while exports decreased by 1.5%. This caused the trade balance to fall from C 54 billion in 2022 to C 45 billion in 2023.\nMeasured as average annual growth between 2002 and 2023, exports increased by 8.8 % per year and imports increased by 7.2 % per year. During the whole period the EU has had a trade surplus with the United States, peaking at C 54 billion in 2022.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 4 Figure 4: EU trade with the United States in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Figure 5 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and Switzerland from 2002 to 2023. In 2023, for the \ufb01rst time in the period under investigation, exports (C 43 billion) were larger than imports (C 38 billion), causing the trade de\ufb01cit of C 1 billion in 2022 to turn into a surplus of C 4 billion in 2023. Over the whole period between 2002 and 2023, measured as average annual growth, exports increased by 10.0 % per year, while imports increased by 7.3 % per year.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 5 Figure 5: EU trade with Switzerland in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products by EU Member State The share of intra EU imports in total (intra + extra) imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 6).

Four countries had shares higher than 20 % for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU exports. These were Slovenia (59 %), Ireland (33 %), Denmark (27 %) and Belgium (25 %).\nBelgium (C 26 billion), Germany (C 20 billion) and the Netherlands (C 16 billion) were the largest importers of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from countries outside the EU, in 20231. In 2023, Slovenia (18 %), Belgium (14 %) and Austria (13 %) had the highest shares for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU imports.\nGermany (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 31 billion) had the largest extra-EU trade surpluses for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023. Only Romania, Slovakia, Malta, Estonia and Czechia had trade de\ufb01cits.\n1Dutch and Belgian imports can be overestimated due to the so-called \"Rotterdam effect\" (See sectionData sources for more details) International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 8 Table 1: Extra EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (C million and %) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Source data for tables and graphs \u2022 International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products: tables and \ufb01gures Data sources This article is based on data available in the Eurostat COMEXT database for EU EU countries and in the United Nations COMTRADE database for non-EU countries.\nA code (such as \u2019DS_018995\u2019) is inserted as part of the source. This code allows the reader to easily access the most recent EU data on the Eurostat website. Note that data on the website is frequently updated and may also be more detailed or have a different measurement unit. It should also be noted that European statistics on international trade in goods are compiled according to the EU concepts and de\ufb01nitions and may, therefore, differ from national data published by EU countries.\nProduct classi\ufb01cation Division 54 \u2019Medicinal and pharmaceutical products\u2019 of the Standard international trade classi\ufb01cation revision 4 (SITC Rev. 4), is made up of the sub-groups: \u2022 5411 \u2019Provitamins and vitamins (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5413 \u2019Antibiotics (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5414 \u2019Vegetable alkaloids (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5415 \u2019Hormones, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes\u2019; \u2022 5416 \u2019Glycosides; glands or other organs; antisera, vaccines; International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 9 \u2022 5419 \u2019Pharmaceutical goods, other than medicaments\u2019; \u2022 5421 \u2019Medicaments containing antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5422 \u2019Medicaments containing hormones, etc., but not antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5423 \u2019Medicaments containing alkaloids, but not containing hormones etc. or antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5429 \u2019Medicaments not elsewhere speci\ufb01ed\u2019.\nUnit of measure Trade values are expressed in millions (106) or billions (109) of euros. They correspond to the statistical value, i.e.\nto the amount which would be invoiced in case of sale or purchase at the national border of the reporting country. It is called a FOB value (free on board) for exports and a CIF value (cost, insurance, freight) for imports.\nA bias in the geographical allocation of extra-EU \ufb02ows Extra-EU imports and exports are reported by the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged, usually the place where the goods cross the EU external frontier (here referred to as the exit/entry Member State). This is not necessarily the Member State of actual import or export. The geographical allocation of an extra-EU \ufb02ow is biased in the case where the entry/exit Member State is not the actual importing/exporting Member State. In such a case, the extra-EU trade will be allocated to the entry/exit Member State and the actual importing/exporting Member State will report only intra-EU \ufb02ows with the exit/entry Member State. This issue particularly impacts the extra-EU imports of EU countries having important ports for transshipment of goods like Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This is why it is known as the \u2019Rotterdam effect\u2019.\nThe United Kingdom is considered as an extra-EU partner country for the EU for the whole period covered by this article. However, the United Kingdom was still part of the internal market until the end of the transitory period (31 December 2020), meaning that data on trade with the United Kingdom are still based on statistical concepts applicable to trade between the EU countries. Consequently, while imports from any other extra-EU trade partner are grouped by country of origin, the United Kingdom data re\ufb02ect the country of consignment. In practice this means that the goods imported by the EU from the United Kingdom were physically transported from the United Kingdom but part of these goods could have been of other origin than the United Kingdom. For this reason, data on trade with the United Kingdom are not fully comparable with data on trade with other extra-EU trade partners.\nContext Pharmaceutical products are among the most important products within the chemicals sector (SITC section 5).\nToday, the pharmaceutical sector is extensively regulated at EU level in the dual interest of ensuring the highest possible level of public health and patient con\ufb01dence in safe, effective and high-quality medicinal products, while continuing to develop a single EU market for pharmaceuticals in order to strengthen the European pharmaceutical industry\u2019s competitiveness and research capability.\nThe most common trade impediments faced by pharmaceutical exporters are a range of burdensome and costly registration, licensing and certi\ufb01cation procedures. The EU aims to redress these through its bilateral trade agreements or by tackling individual barriers as part of its market access partnership.\nOther articles \u2022 International trade in goods - other articles International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 10 Dedicated section International trade in goods - dedicated section Database International trade in goods - database Data visualisations \u2022 International trade in goods - visualisations Methodology International trade in goods - methodology Legislation \u2022 International trade in goods - legislation External links \u2022 European Commission - DG Trade Notes International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 11Skip links\nWorld's Top ExportsTrade metrics that inspire global thinking\nTrade metrics that inspire global thinking\nHeader Right\nImports of Drugs and Medicines by Country\nby Daniel Workman \nPharmaceuticals closeupWorldwide purchases of imported pharmaceutical drugs and medicines cost a total US$498 billion in 2023.Overall spending on pharmaceutical drugs and medicine imports increased by an average 19.1% for all importer countries since 2019 when import purchases of drugs and medicines were valued at $418.1 billion.Year over year, international purchases of exported drugs and medicines flatlined via a 0.2% compared to $497.1 billion in 2022.The world\u2019s 5 biggest importers of pharmaceutical medicines are the United States of America, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and mainland China. Collectively, that leading cohort of international buyers paid for 43.9% of globally imported drugs and medicines during 2023. That percentage indicates a relatively concentrated market of buyers worldwide.From a continental perspective, European countries were responsible for over half (53.8%) of spending on drugs and medicines imported during 2023 with pharmaceutical purchases valued at $268 billion. In second place were North American importers at 20.7% while another 17.4% of imported pharmaceuticals was delivered to customers in Asia.Smaller percentages were delivered to Latin America (3.9%) excluding Mexico but including the Caribbean, Africa (2.7%), then Oceania (1.5%) led by Australia and New Zealand.The metrics below combine subtotals for two 4-digit Harmonized Tariff System code prefixes for drugs and medicine subcategories, specifically prefixes 3003 (consisting of 2 or more constituents mixed together) and 3004 (other).Drugs and Medicines: Top 15 Importer CountriesBelow are the 15 countries that imported the highest dollar value worth of drugs and medicines during 2023.United States: US$89.8 billion (18% of imported prescription drugs and medicines)Switzerland: $40.5 billion (8.1%)Germany: $32.5 billion (6.5%)Belgium: $31.3 billion (6.3%)mainland China: $24.5 billion (4.9%)Italy: $20.6 billion (4.1%)France: $18.4 billion (3.7%)United Kingdom: $16.8 billion (3.4%)Japan: $15.9 billion (3.2%)Netherlands: $15.8 billion (3.2%)Spain: $14.9 billion (3%)Canada: $11.5 billion (2.3%)Russia: $8.7 billion (1.7%)Slovenia: $7.5 billion (1.5%)Poland: $6.9 billion (1.4%)By value, the listed 15 countries purchased 71.4% of all prescription drugs and medicines imports in 2023.Among the above countries, the fastest-growing markets for prescription drugs and medicines since 2019 were: Slovenia (up 92.6%), Switzerland (up 90.4%), Netherlands (up 55.9%) and Spain (up 38.5%).Three major markets that posted declines in their imported prescription drugs and medicines purchases were: Russia (down -16.9% from 2022), United Kingdom (down -10.6%) and Japan (down -6.4%).Drugs and Medicines: All Importer Countries in 2023By value, the 100 key countries showcased in the following automated database bought 98.5% of imported pharmaceutical drugs and medicines purchased in 2023.RankImporterDrugs & Medicines%2019-231.United States$89,784,868,000+13.3%2.Switzerland$40,508,742,000+90.4%3.Germany$32,470,160,000+4.7%4.Belgium$31,341,161,000+33%5.mainland China$24,543,916,000+14.1%6.Italy$20,578,736,000+20.4%7.France$18,352,469,000+15.5%8.United Kingdom$16,789,558,000-10.6%9.Japan$15,874,455,000-6.4%10.Netherlands$15,846,137,000+55.9%11.Spain$14,915,496,000+38.5%12.Canada$11,528,660,000+35.5%13.Russia$8,677,211,000-16.9%14.Slovenia$7,547,471,000+92.6%15.Poland$6,943,402,000+33.5%16.Australia$6,060,842,000+13.3%17.Ireland$5,971,430,000+39.2%18.Czech Republic$5,412,484,000+26.1%19.South Korea$5,334,372,000+30.1%20.Brazil$5,073,335,000+31.7%21.Austria$4,648,764,000+22.6%22.Mexico$4,533,840,000+60.3%23.Romania$4,300,172,000+40.3%24.Taiwan$4,166,141,000+35%25.Denmark$3,872,409,000+17.6%26.Saudi Arabia$3,666,414,000-11.9%27.Sweden$3,346,424,000+17.1%28.Egypt$3,275,554,000+51.4%29.Hungary$3,074,217,000+6.7%30.Greece$2,987,559,000+35.3%31.Hong Kong$2,983,988,000+34.1%32.Portugal$2,755,852,000+20.3%33.United Arab Emirates$2,429,182,000-25.6%34.T\u00fcrkiye$2,344,378,000-13.2%35.Colombia$2,301,768,000+46.5%36.Panama$2,119,079,000+26%37.Thailand$2,088,829,000+20.6%38.Slovakia$2,068,323,000+29.7%39.Singapore$1,923,068,000+20%40.Israel$1,897,285,000+9.4%41.Finland$1,870,201,000+17.1%42.Vietnam$1,819,464,000-32.6%43.Bulgaria$1,763,585,000+37.7%44.Ukraine$1,733,174,000+1%45.South Africa$1,731,505,000-3%46.Norway$1,705,741,000+10.1%47.Philippines$1,705,359,000+23.8%48.Kazakhstan$1,447,313,000+63.6%49.Chile$1,444,123,000+33.2%50.Lithuania$1,375,341,000+32.5%51.India$1,360,321,000-0.6%52.Argentina$1,266,289,000+10.1%53.Serbia$1,258,935,000+56.6%54.Malaysia$1,236,736,000-10.2%55.Croatia$1,157,943,000+30.7%56.New Zealand$1,021,456,000+58.8%57.Ecuador$1,009,529,000+40.5%58.Dominican Republic$903,093,000+50.5%59.Algeria$890,666,000-26.8%60.Indonesia$824,449,000+32.5%61.Guatemala$823,646,000+50.9%62.Latvia$793,096,000+30%63.Iraq$781,840,000-22.3%64.Uzbekistan$725,626,000-12.1%65.Costa Rica$676,671,000+16%66.Peru$670,747,000+15.8%67.Estonia$653,465,000+34.8%68.Luxembourg$627,835,000+39.8%69.Nigeria$616,888,000-31%70.Morocco$590,242,000+28.4%71.Jordan$549,354,000+23.2%72.Kuwait$524,991,000-49.5%73.Honduras$524,968,000+20.4%74.Sri Lanka$518,445,000+32.9%75.El Salvador$503,492,000+28.6%76.Tunisia$480,237,000+9.7%77.Iran$472,615,000-46.3%78.Azerbaijan$461,973,000+76.6%79.Ethiopia$460,848,000-17.4%80.Kenya$452,729,000-4.2%81.Belarus$448,584,000-24.7%82.Cyprus$431,955,000+61%83.Georgia$427,490,000+32.2%84.Nicaragua$419,879,000+30%85.Ivory Coast$403,719,000+16.7%86.Macao$378,970,000+63.3%87.Malta$371,918,000+50.8%88.Pakistan$365,901,000-22.4%89.Bosnia/Herzegovina$363,769,000+26.8%90.Myanmar$353,747,000-21.1%91.Qatar$352,935,000-23.8%92.Tanzania$328,493,000+31.2%93.Cambodia$268,915,000+39.6%94.Democratic Rep.

    "question": "In 2023, what was the difference between Germany's extra-EU exports and its pharmaceutical imports?",

    "correct": false,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Extracted numerical values from the document\n    germany_exports = 62  # Germany's extra-EU exports in 2023\n    germany_imports = 32.5  # Germany's pharmaceutical imports in 2023\n\n    # Step 1: Subtract Germany's imports from exports\n    answer = germany_exports - germany_imports\n\n    return answer",

    "pred_reasoning": "In 2023, Germany's extra-EU exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products were valued at \u20ac62 billion, while its imports from countries outside the EU were valued at \u20ac20 billion. The difference between Germany's extra-EU exports and its pharmaceutical imports is calculated by subtracting the import value from the export value: \u20ac62 billion - \u20ac20 billion = \u20ac42 billion.",
    "judge_reasoning": "The two solutions are different. Solution 1 calculates the difference between Germany's extra-EU exports and its pharmaceutical imports, using the values \u20ac62 billion for exports and \u20ac32.5 billion for imports, resulting in an answer of \u20ac29.5 billion. Solution 2, however, uses the same export value of \u20ac62 billion but a different import value of \u20ac20 billion, leading to a different answer of \u20ac42 billion. The discrepancy lies in the import values used in each solution, which results in different final answers."

Even the \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008, which affected trade in many other products, did not cause a fall in exports or imports. With exports increasing more than imports, the trade surplus increased from C 18 billion in 2002 to a record high of C 174 billion in 2022 but fell to C 158 billion in 2023.\nFigure 1: EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Increasing share in total trade In 2023, the share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade was 7.8% with the share for imports (4.7%) much smaller than the share for exports (10.8%). Between 2002 and 2008 these shares remained fairly stable (Figure 2). In 2009, the share of imports increased by 1.3 percentage points (pp) and exports by 1.6 pp.\nThis was not caused by an increase in trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products but rather by the decline in total trade. Since 2009, the shares have been \ufb02uctuating but there is a clear overall growth.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 2 Figure 2: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade, 2002-2023 (% in total trade) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) United States and Switzerland remain the top EU partners The United States stands out as the EU\u2019s main trading partner for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 (Figure 3). Exports to the United States (33 %) were almost a third of all EU exports and were followed at some distance by Switzerland (15 %) and China (8 %). Imports to the EU were dominated even more by the United States (39 %) and Switzerland (32 %) followed by the United Kingdom (7 %). Since the United States and Switzerland are by far the two largest trade partners, the development of their trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products with the EU is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 3 Figure 3: Main EU partners for trade of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade with the United States and Switzerland between 2002 and 2023 Figure 4 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and the United States from 2002 to 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, imports from the United States increased by 19.3% while exports decreased by 1.5%. This caused the trade balance to fall from C 54 billion in 2022 to C 45 billion in 2023.\nMeasured as average annual growth between 2002 and 2023, exports increased by 8.8 % per year and imports increased by 7.2 % per year. During the whole period the EU has had a trade surplus with the United States, peaking at C 54 billion in 2022.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 4 Figure 4: EU trade with the United States in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Figure 5 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and Switzerland from 2002 to 2023. In 2023, for the \ufb01rst time in the period under investigation, exports (C 43 billion) were larger than imports (C 38 billion), causing the trade de\ufb01cit of C 1 billion in 2022 to turn into a surplus of C 4 billion in 2023. Over the whole period between 2002 and 2023, measured as average annual growth, exports increased by 10.0 % per year, while imports increased by 7.3 % per year.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 5 Figure 5: EU trade with Switzerland in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products by EU Member State The share of intra EU imports in total (intra + extra) imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 6). For Luxembourg, Lithua-nia and Estonia it was above 93 %, while for Slovenia and Malta it was below 40 %. The average for the EU was 68 %.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 6 Figure 6: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in intra and extra EU imports, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) The share of intra EU exports in total (intra + extra) exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products also varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 7). For Luxembourg, Slovakia, Czechia and Estonia it was above 80 %, while for Portugal, Finland, Denmark and Slovenia it was below 40 %. The average for the EU was 48 %.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 7 Figure 7: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in intra and extra EU exports, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Table 1 shows that in 2023, amongst the EU countries, Germany had the highest extra-EU exports (C 62 billion) followed by Belgium (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 37 billion). Four countries had shares higher than 20 % for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU exports. These were Slovenia (59 %), Ireland (33 %), Denmark (27 %) and Belgium (25 %).\nBelgium (C 26 billion), Germany (C 20 billion) and the Netherlands (C 16 billion) were the largest importers of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from countries outside the EU, in 20231. In 2023, Slovenia (18 %), Belgium (14 %) and Austria (13 %) had the highest shares for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU imports.\nGermany (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 31 billion) had the largest extra-EU trade surpluses for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023. Only Romania, Slovakia, Malta, Estonia and Czechia had trade de\ufb01cits.\n1Dutch and Belgian imports can be overestimated due to the so-called \"Rotterdam effect\" (See sectionData sources for more details) International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 8 Table 1: Extra EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (C million and %) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Source data for tables and graphs \u2022 International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products: tables and \ufb01gures Data sources This article is based on data available in the Eurostat COMEXT database for EU EU countries and in the United Nations COMTRADE database for non-EU countries.\nA code (such as \u2019DS_018995\u2019) is inserted as part of the source. This code allows the reader to easily access the most recent EU data on the Eurostat website. Note that data on the website is frequently updated and may also be more detailed or have a different measurement unit. It should also be noted that European statistics on international trade in goods are compiled according to the EU concepts and de\ufb01nitions and may, therefore, differ from national data published by EU countries.\nProduct classi\ufb01cation Division 54 \u2019Medicinal and pharmaceutical products\u2019 of the Standard international trade classi\ufb01cation revision 4 (SITC Rev. 4), is made up of the sub-groups: \u2022 5411 \u2019Provitamins and vitamins (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5413 \u2019Antibiotics (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5414 \u2019Vegetable alkaloids (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5415 \u2019Hormones, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes\u2019; \u2022 5416 \u2019Glycosides; glands or other organs; antisera, vaccines; International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 9 \u2022 5419 \u2019Pharmaceutical goods, other than medicaments\u2019; \u2022 5421 \u2019Medicaments containing antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5422 \u2019Medicaments containing hormones, etc., but not antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5423 \u2019Medicaments containing alkaloids, but not containing hormones etc. or antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5429 \u2019Medicaments not elsewhere speci\ufb01ed\u2019.\nUnit of measure Trade values are expressed in millions (106) or billions (109) of euros. They correspond to the statistical value, i.e.\nto the amount which would be invoiced in case of sale or purchase at the national border of the reporting country. It is called a FOB value (free on board) for exports and a CIF value (cost, insurance, freight) for imports.\nA bias in the geographical allocation of extra-EU \ufb02ows Extra-EU imports and exports are reported by the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged, usually the place where the goods cross the EU external frontier (here referred to as the exit/entry Member State). This is not necessarily the Member State of actual import or export. The geographical allocation of an extra-EU \ufb02ow is biased in the case where the entry/exit Member State is not the actual importing/exporting Member State. In such a case, the extra-EU trade will be allocated to the entry/exit Member State and the actual importing/exporting Member State will report only intra-EU \ufb02ows with the exit/entry Member State. This issue particularly impacts the extra-EU imports of EU countries having important ports for transshipment of goods like Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This is why it is known as the \u2019Rotterdam effect\u2019.\nThe United Kingdom is considered as an extra-EU partner country for the EU for the whole period covered by this article. However, the United Kingdom was still part of the internal market until the end of the transitory period (31 December 2020), meaning that data on trade with the United Kingdom are still based on statistical concepts applicable to trade between the EU countries. Consequently, while imports from any other extra-EU trade partner are grouped by country of origin, the United Kingdom data re\ufb02ect the country of consignment. In practice this means that the goods imported by the EU from the United Kingdom were physically transported from the United Kingdom but part of these goods could have been of other origin than the United Kingdom. For this reason, data on trade with the United Kingdom are not fully comparable with data on trade with other extra-EU trade partners.\nContext Pharmaceutical products are among the most important products within the chemicals sector (SITC section 5).\nToday, the pharmaceutical sector is extensively regulated at EU level in the dual interest of ensuring the highest possible level of public health and patient con\ufb01dence in safe, effective and high-quality medicinal products, while continuing to develop a single EU market for pharmaceuticals in order to strengthen the European pharmaceutical industry\u2019s competitiveness and research capability.\nThe most common trade impediments faced by pharmaceutical exporters are a range of burdensome and costly registration, licensing and certi\ufb01cation procedures. The EU aims to redress these through its bilateral trade agreements or by tackling individual barriers as part of its market access partnership.\nOther articles \u2022 International trade in goods - other articles International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 10 Dedicated section International trade in goods - dedicated section Database International trade in goods - database Data visualisations \u2022 International trade in goods - visualisations Methodology International trade in goods - methodology Legislation \u2022 International trade in goods - legislation External links \u2022 European Commission - DG Trade Notes International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 11Skip links\nWorld's Top ExportsTrade metrics that inspire global thinking\nTrade metrics that inspire global thinking\nHeader Right\nImports of Drugs and Medicines by Country\nby Daniel Workman \nPharmaceuticals closeupWorldwide purchases of imported pharmaceutical drugs and medicines cost a total US$498 billion in 2023.Overall spending on pharmaceutical drugs and medicine imports increased by an average 19.1% for all importer countries since 2019 when import purchases of drugs and medicines were valued at $418.1 billion.Year over year, international purchases of exported drugs and medicines flatlined via a 0.2% compared to $497.1 billion in 2022.The world\u2019s 5 biggest importers of pharmaceutical medicines are the United States of America, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and mainland China. Collectively, that leading cohort of international buyers paid for 43.9% of globally imported drugs and medicines during 2023. That percentage indicates a relatively concentrated market of buyers worldwide.From a continental perspective, European countries were responsible for over half (53.8%) of spending on drugs and medicines imported during 2023 with pharmaceutical purchases valued at $268 billion. In second place were North American importers at 20.7% while another 17.4% of imported pharmaceuticals was delivered to customers in Asia.Smaller percentages were delivered to Latin America (3.9%) excluding Mexico but including the Caribbean, Africa (2.7%), then Oceania (1.5%) led by Australia and New Zealand.The metrics below combine subtotals for two 4-digit Harmonized Tariff System code prefixes for drugs and medicine subcategories, specifically prefixes 3003 (consisting of 2 or more constituents mixed together) and 3004 (other).Drugs and Medicines: Top 15 Importer CountriesBelow are the 15 countries that imported the highest dollar value worth of drugs and medicines during 2023.United States: US$89.8 billion (18% of imported prescription drugs and medicines)Switzerland: $40.5 billion (8.1%)Germany: $32.5 billion (6.5%)Belgium: $31.3 billion (6.3%)mainland China: $24.5 billion (4.9%)Italy: $20.6 billion (4.1%)France: $18.4 billion (3.7%)United Kingdom: $16.8 billion (3.4%)Japan: $15.9 billion (3.2%)Netherlands: $15.8 billion (3.2%)Spain: $14.9 billion (3%)Canada: $11.5 billion (2.3%)Russia: $8.7 billion (1.7%)Slovenia: $7.5 billion (1.5%)Poland: $6.9 billion (1.4%)By value, the listed 15 countries purchased 71.4% of all prescription drugs and medicines imports in 2023.Among the above countries, the fastest-growing markets for prescription drugs and medicines since 2019 were: Slovenia (up 92.6%), Switzerland (up 90.4%), Netherlands (up 55.9%) and Spain (up 38.5%).Three major markets that posted declines in their imported prescription drugs and medicines purchases were: Russia (down -16.9% from 2022), United Kingdom (down -10.6%) and Japan (down -6.4%).Drugs and Medicines: All Importer Countries in 2023By value, the 100 key countries showcased in the following automated database bought 98.5% of imported pharmaceutical drugs and medicines purchased in 2023.RankImporterDrugs & Medicines%2019-231.United States$89,784,868,000+13.3%2.Switzerland$40,508,742,000+90.4%3.Germany$32,470,160,000+4.7%4.Belgium$31,341,161,000+33%5.mainland China$24,543,916,000+14.1%6.Italy$20,578,736,000+20.4%7.France$18,352,469,000+15.5%8.United Kingdom$16,789,558,000-10.6%9.Japan$15,874,455,000-6.4%10.Netherlands$15,846,137,000+55.9%11.Spain$14,915,496,000+38.5%12.Canada$11,528,660,000+35.5%13.Russia$8,677,211,000-16.9%14.Slovenia$7,547,471,000+92.6%15.Poland$6,943,402,000+33.5%16.Australia$6,060,842,000+13.3%17.Ireland$5,971,430,000+39.2%18.Czech Republic$5,412,484,000+26.1%19.South Korea$5,334,372,000+30.1%20.Brazil$5,073,335,000+31.7%21.Austria$4,648,764,000+22.6%22.Mexico$4,533,840,000+60.3%23.Romania$4,300,172,000+40.3%24.Taiwan$4,166,141,000+35%25.Denmark$3,872,409,000+17.6%26.Saudi Arabia$3,666,414,000-11.9%27.Sweden$3,346,424,000+17.1%28.Egypt$3,275,554,000+51.4%29.Hungary$3,074,217,000+6.7%30.Greece$2,987,559,000+35.3%31.Hong Kong$2,983,988,000+34.1%32.Portugal$2,755,852,000+20.3%33.United Arab Emirates$2,429,182,000-25.6%34.T\u00fcrkiye$2,344,378,000-13.2%35.Colombia$2,301,768,000+46.5%36.Panama$2,119,079,000+26%37.Thailand$2,088,829,000+20.6%38.Slovakia$2,068,323,000+29.7%39.Singapore$1,923,068,000+20%40.Israel$1,897,285,000+9.4%41.Finland$1,870,201,000+17.1%42.Vietnam$1,819,464,000-32.6%43.Bulgaria$1,763,585,000+37.7%44.Ukraine$1,733,174,000+1%45.South Africa$1,731,505,000-3%46.Norway$1,705,741,000+10.1%47.Philippines$1,705,359,000+23.8%48.Kazakhstan$1,447,313,000+63.6%49.Chile$1,444,123,000+33.2%50.Lithuania$1,375,341,000+32.5%51.India$1,360,321,000-0.6%52.Argentina$1,266,289,000+10.1%53.Serbia$1,258,935,000+56.6%54.Malaysia$1,236,736,000-10.2%55.Croatia$1,157,943,000+30.7%56.New Zealand$1,021,456,000+58.8%57.Ecuador$1,009,529,000+40.5%58.Dominican Republic$903,093,000+50.5%59.Algeria$890,666,000-26.8%60.Indonesia$824,449,000+32.5%61.Guatemala$823,646,000+50.9%62.Latvia$793,096,000+30%63.Iraq$781,840,000-22.3%64.Uzbekistan$725,626,000-12.1%65.Costa Rica$676,671,000+16%66.Peru$670,747,000+15.8%67.Estonia$653,465,000+34.8%68.Luxembourg$627,835,000+39.8%69.Nigeria$616,888,000-31%70.Morocco$590,242,000+28.4%71.Jordan$549,354,000+23.2%72.Kuwait$524,991,000-49.5%73.Honduras$524,968,000+20.4%74.Sri Lanka$518,445,000+32.9%75.El Salvador$503,492,000+28.6%76.Tunisia$480,237,000+9.7%77.Iran$472,615,000-46.3%78.Azerbaijan$461,973,000+76.6%79.Ethiopia$460,848,000-17.4%80.Kenya$452,729,000-4.2%81.Belarus$448,584,000-24.7%82.Cyprus$431,955,000+61%83.Georgia$427,490,000+32.2%84.Nicaragua$419,879,000+30%85.Ivory Coast$403,719,000+16.7%86.Macao$378,970,000+63.3%87.Malta$371,918,000+50.8%88.Pakistan$365,901,000-22.4%89.Bosnia/Herzegovina$363,769,000+26.8%90.Myanmar$353,747,000-21.1%91.Qatar$352,935,000-23.8%92.Tanzania$328,493,000+31.2%93.Cambodia$268,915,000+39.6%94.Democratic Rep.

    "question": "In 2023, what is the difference between Belgium's total pharmaceutical imports and its extra-EU pharmaceutical imports?",
    "expected_answer": 5.300000000000001,
    "pred_answer": 5.3,
    "correct": true,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Extracted numerical values from the documents\n    belgium_imports_extra_eu = 26.0  # Belgium's extra-EU imports in 2023\n    belgium_imports_total = 31.3  # Total Belgium pharmaceutical imports in 2023\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the difference between total imports and extra-EU imports\n    difference = belgium_imports_total - belgium_imports_extra_eu\n\n    answer = difference\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "From the Long-Context Documents, Belgium's total pharmaceutical imports in 2023 are valued at $31.3 billion. The extra-EU pharmaceutical imports for Belgium are not directly provided in the documents. However, the document mentions that Belgium is one of the largest importers of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from countries outside the EU, with a value of C 26 billion. Therefore, the difference between Belgium's total pharmaceutical imports and its extra-EU pharmaceutical imports is $31.3 billion - C 26 billion. Assuming the currency conversion is not required, the difference is $31.3 billion - C 26 billion = $5.3 billion.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions aim to find the difference between Belgium's total pharmaceutical imports and its extra-EU pharmaceutical imports. Solution 1 directly calculates this difference using the given numerical values, resulting in 5.300000000000001. Solution 2 describes the same calculation process, assuming no currency conversion is needed, and arrives at a difference of 5.3. The reasoning steps in both solutions are equivalent, as they both subtract the extra-EU imports from the total imports. The slight discrepancy in the numerical answer is due to floating-point precision, which is a common occurrence in numerical computations. Therefore, the solutions are considered equivalent."

Collectively, that leading cohort of international buyers paid for 43.9% of globally imported drugs and medicines during 2023. That percentage indicates a relatively concentrated market of buyers worldwide.From a continental perspective, European countries were responsible for over half (53.8%) of spending on drugs and medicines imported during 2023 with pharmaceutical purchases valued at $268 billion.

But we fought back\u2014and won,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\"Today, for the first time in history, my Administration is announcing that Medicare has reached agreements on new, lower prices with the manufacturers of all 10 drugs selected for the first round of drug price negotiation.\"\nThe affected medications include those Americans use to manage diabetes, cancer and heart disease, which affect millions each year.\nFor the 10 medications, Medicare recipients will save between 38 and 79 percent starting in 2026. The drugs include Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp.\nBlood clot medications Eliquis and Xarelto went down to $231 and $197, while diabetes medications got major savings too.\nJardiance, Januvia, Farxiga and Fiasp shaved hundreds off their list prices for 2026, now costing between $100 and $200 compared to previous costs above $500 for a 30-day supply.\nThe full list of price changes was announced on the White House website.\nAltogether, more than 67 million Americans rely on Medicare for their health coverage, but high drug prices and premiums have made health care unaffordable for many.\n\"It's a relief for the millions of seniors that take these drugs to treat everything from heart failure, blood clots, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn's disease, and more\u2014and it's a relief for American taxpayers,\" Biden said.\nMedicare previously said blood thinners Xarelto and Eliquis would see lower prices because of the new deals, alongside diabetes medications Jardiance and Januvia.\nPreviously, the U.S. government was not permitted to negotiate with Big Pharma over drug prices, though private insurers always had this ability.\n\"This meant that drug companies could basically charge whatever they want for lifesaving treatments people rely on, and all Americans paid the price,\" White House adviser Neera Tanden said in a media call on Wednesday evening.\nPharmaceutical companies have not been pleased with Biden's price negotiations and pushed against the Inflation Reduction Act, which made the negotiations law.\nWhile the first 10 selected drug prices aren't set to change until 2026, the U.S. government can pick another 15 medications to negotiate on next year.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the negotiations would save the government $25 billion in the next seven years.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also instituted a cap on out-of-pocket drug costs, which is set to start in 2025. Next year, seniors can expect to pay a maximum of $2,000 for their prescriptions.\n\"As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare Part D has become a stronger safety net for Medicare beneficiaries who need expensive medications,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for medicareresources.org, told Newsweek. \"This will provide significant financial relief to enrollees who used to spend far more than that for their medications.\"\nWith the lower costs on prescriptions, there is some concern that those costs could be passed on to Medicare premium prices. Likely in an effort to mitigate some of those issues, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is paying an extra $15 per member per month to insurers.\n\"Some Republican lawmakers are challenging the premium stabilization program, alleging that it should have required congressional approval,\" Norris said. \"But the implementation of this program should ensure that people with Medicare Part D continue to have multiple affordable options for 2025.\"\nOpen enrollment for Medicare begins October 15 and runs to December 7, with all plan selections taking effect in January.\n\"It's a big win for Medicare recipients. One of the concerns going into these negotiations was that a deal wouldn't be reached, and a few of these drugs wouldn't have the same amount of coverage many need,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\n\"Even if you don't use one of the drugs covered, it's an encouraging sign,\" he added. \"With an increasing older population in America, more taxpayers are going to join Medicare in the coming years. The government taking a more proactive approach to negotiations to cover drug prices is one current and future recipients will be thankful for.\"\nUpdate 8/15/24, 10:18 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nTop stories\n\nTrump Is Picking the 'Avenger Squad' for Cabinet, Charlie Kirk Says\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nTrump Allies React to Biden Allowing Ukraine to Hit Russia With US ATACMS\n\nTrump Picks FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr To Lead the Agency\nAbout the writer\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

    "pred_reasoning": "In 2026, the United States government expects taxpayers to save $6 billion due to the new Medicare drug price negotiations. In 2023, the total cost of drug imports to the United States was $89.8 billion. To find the percentage that the taxpayer savings represent of the 2023 drug import cost, we use the formula: (savings / total cost) * 100. Substituting the given values, we have (6 billion / 89.8 billion) * 100 = 6.68%. Therefore, the taxpayer savings represent approximately 6.68% of the 2023 drug import cost.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they calculate the percentage of taxpayer savings in 2026 relative to the drug import cost in 2023 using the formula (savings / total cost) * 100. Solution 1 uses variables and a function to perform the calculation, while Solution 2 describes the process in a narrative form. The numerical values used in both solutions are consistent: $6 billion for taxpayer savings and $89.8 billion for drug imports. The final numerical answers are also effectively the same, with Solution 1 providing a more precise value (6.682640553639841) and Solution 2 rounding it to 6.68%. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent in reasoning and final answer."

Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience. The study measures satisfaction with service at franchised dealer or aftermarket service facilities for maintenance or repair work among owners and lessees of one- to three-year-old vehicles.\nIt also provides a numerical index ranking of the highest-performing automotive brands sold in the United States, which is based on the combined scores of five measures that comprise the vehicle owner service experience. These measures are (in order of importance): service quality; service advisor; vehicle pick-up; service facility; and service initiation. In 2023, model segment rankings were added to the study to differentiate between the service needs of cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans.\nFollowing are key findings of the 2024 study:\nHighest-Ranking Brands and Segments\n\u2022 Lexus\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among premium brands for a third consecutive year, with a score of 897.\u00a0Porsche\u00a0(894) ranks second and\u00a0Cadillac\u00a0(883) ranks third.\n\u2022 Buick\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among mass market brands with a score of 887.\u00a0MINI\u00a0(884) ranks second and\u00a0Subaru\u00a0(877) ranks third.\n\u2022 MINI (877) ranks highest in the mass market car segment, followed by Subaru (874) and\u00a0Mazda\u00a0(867).\n\u2022 Buick ranks highest among mass market SUVs/minivans with a score of 887.\u00a0Mitsubishi\u00a0(877) and Subaru (877) each rank second in a tie.\n\u2022 Porsche (902) ranks highest in the premium car segment, followed by\u00a0Infiniti\u00a0(900) and Lexus (892).\n\u2022 Lexus ranks highest in the premium SUV segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 898.

Travel times will be reduced by up to 20% during peak traffic periods. Adjustments were also made to the timing during other parts of the day to make signals more responsive to side-street traffic and pedestrians while still keeping Dodge Street moving smoothly.\nPedestrian safety benefits along the corridor include the implementation of 72 new leading pedestrian interval phases. A reprogrammed walk signal with leading pedestrian intervals displays a walk signal before a green light, allowing pedestrians a head start in crossing the street to establish a more visible presence in the intersection before vehicles are allowed to turn right or left.

Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience. The study measures satisfaction with service at franchised dealer or aftermarket service facilities for maintenance or repair work among owners and lessees of one- to three-year-old vehicles.\nIt also provides a numerical index ranking of the highest-performing automotive brands sold in the United States, which is based on the combined scores of five measures that comprise the vehicle owner service experience. These measures are (in order of importance): service quality; service advisor; vehicle pick-up; service facility; and service initiation. In 2023, model segment rankings were added to the study to differentiate between the service needs of cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans.\nFollowing are key findings of the 2024 study:\nHighest-Ranking Brands and Segments\n\u2022 Lexus\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among premium brands for a third consecutive year, with a score of 897.\u00a0Porsche\u00a0(894) ranks second and\u00a0Cadillac\u00a0(883) ranks third.\n\u2022 Buick\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among mass market brands with a score of 887.\u00a0MINI\u00a0(884) ranks second and\u00a0Subaru\u00a0(877) ranks third.\n\u2022 MINI (877) ranks highest in the mass market car segment, followed by Subaru (874) and\u00a0Mazda\u00a0(867).\n\u2022 Buick ranks highest among mass market SUVs/minivans with a score of 887.\u00a0Mitsubishi\u00a0(877) and Subaru (877) each rank second in a tie.\n\u2022 Porsche (902) ranks highest in the premium car segment, followed by\u00a0Infiniti\u00a0(900) and Lexus (892).\n\u2022 Lexus ranks highest in the premium SUV segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 898. Porsche (889) ranks second and Cadillac (882) ranks third.Nissan\u00a0ranks highest in the truck segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 873.\u00a0Chevrolet\u00a0(856) ranks second and\u00a0Toyota\u00a0(855) ranks third.\n\n\n\n\nNo results found.\nGet The Newsletter\ncontact a sales person\nSupport Center\nMOTOR Magazine\n\u00a9 2024 Hearst Business Publishing, Inc. | \r\n                         Privacy policy | \r\n                         MEDIA | \r\n                         Black Book\nAn official website of the  City of Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCITY OF OMAHA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOmaha, Nebraska\n\n\n                Traffic Signal Changes Improve Safety            \n(January 6, 2023)\nDrivers traveling the Dodge Street corridor in midtown Omaha will find their journeys safer and more efficient since signals have been retimed by the City of Omaha Traffic Engineering Division.\nBy strategically changing the signal timings at 37 signalized intersections along Dodge, Farnam, and Harney Streets between 67th and 33rd Streets, projections show a reduction of over 50 crashes over five years.\nDrivers will save 30,300 hours in travel time and 48,500 gallons of fuel over the same five-year period.

Please have the exact location of the problem ready.\nNYC DOT's contractors are required to arrive at the scene of the most serious problems (e.g., all lights out, or a knocked-down pole) within two hours of notification. If a bulb is out, contractors are required to respond within 48 hours.\nAccessible Pedestrian Signals\nNYC DOT installs special signals at crosswalks to assist pedestrians who are blind or have low vision. The signals make sounds and vibrate when pedestrians push a button installed at the crosswalk.\r\n  Learn more and see a list of all accessible pedestrian signals in New York City\nView a list of accessible pedestrian signals on NYC Open Data\nContact NYC DOT online to report a problem or request a new APS\n\nFlashing Yellow Arrow Turn Signals\nTurn signals reduce injuries for pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as improve safety, comfort and mobility for motorists. This video shows two examples of flashing yellow arrow left turn signals in New York City.\n\nSignal Timing\nExclusive Pedestrian Signals\nAt some intersections, NYC DOT programs traffic signals with an interval that stops traffic in all directions, giving pedestrians an exclusive time to cross the street.\r\n  View a list of exclusive pedestrian signals on NYC Open Data\n\nLeading Pedestrian Interval Signals\nTraffic signals at some intersections give pedestrians a head start to cross the street before car traffic. The goal of these signals is to improve street safety by giving pedestrians a chance to begin crossing the street before cars make turns across the crosswalk.\r\n  View a list of leading pedestrian intervals on NYC Open Data\nView the locations of leading pedestrian intervals on the Vision Zero View map\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Traffic Signals\nWhat does a traffic signal do?\nA traffic signal controls the right-of-way for vehicles arriving at an intersection, which can reduce traffic delay and accident-producing conflicts. It also makes an intersection safe by determining whether vehicles or pedestrians should proceed.\nDoes a traffic signal control speed?\nNo. In some areas where speeding is a problem, residents believe that a traffic signal is needed to address the speeding problem. In fact, traffic signals sometimes result in greater speeds as drivers accelerate to try to get through the signal before it turns red. Other traffic control measures, such as speed humps, speed limit signs, and traffic enforcement, are more effective in controlling speed.\nHow many traffic signals are there in New York City?\nAs of March 2022, there were 13,543 intersections with traffic signals citywide, including 2,862 in Manhattan, 1,768 in the Bronx, 4,848 in Brooklyn, 3,432 in Queens and 633 in Staten Island.\nHow long does it take lights to change?\nSignal timing cycle lengths usually fall between 45 and 120 seconds. The timing for each signal is determined based on traffic volume and traffic patterns in each particular area.\nA traffic signal's cycle is too long or too short, will NYC DOT change it?\nSometimes the presence of a traffic signal will result in changes in the previous traffic patterns, as some drivers seek alternative routes to avoid the signal. This may mean that the current signal timing is no longer appropriate. If you believe that the timing of a particular signal is incorrect, contact the NYC DOT Commissioner with your request. NYC DOT will conduct a study of traffic patterns to determine if any adjustments are needed. A study will take approximately 12 weeks.\nHow can I request a new traffic signal?\nYou can request the installation of a traffic signal by writing to the NYC DOT Commissioner. You can also request an accessible pedestrian signal, which plays audible messages to assist visually impaired users.\nHow does NYC DOT decide whether a traffic signal should be installed at an intersection?\nNYC DOT uses a detailed process called an intersection control study to determine if traffic signals or multi-way stop signs are appropriate for a location. The study includes (but is not limited to) these steps:\nWhat are the Federal Guidelines for traffic signals?\nThe federal standards for traffic control devices can be found in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which is published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The MUTCD establishes criteria known as \"warrants\" which are used to determine if a new traffic signal is appropriate.\nThe latest edition of the MUTCD, published in 2009, sets forth nine warrants, which are summarized below.\r\nLearn more about the MUTCD on the FHWA web site\nWhat is the Red Light Camera Program?\nThe Red Light Camera Program uses technology that enables NYC DOT to automatically take high-resolution photographs of vehicles that go through red lights, including close-ups of the license plates. Summonses are issued to the owners of the vehicles, as with parking violations. The photos are included with the summonses. The City had the first full-time red light photographic enforcement program in the United States, and was the first jurisdiction to send photos to respondents as part of the summons.\nAre red light cameras effective in preventing drivers from running red lights?\nStudies have shown a 40 percent decrease in the total number of incidents of motorists going through red lights at the locations where cameras have been installed. That means fewer accidents, making New York City much safer for pedestrians and other motorists.\nSince the Red Light Camera program began in December 1993, more than 4 million summonses have been issued through 2007. Because the summonses include photographs of the vehicle going through the intersection, very few motorists have contested the summonses. About 88% have been found guilty.\nIn April 1998, legislation was enacted that authorized NYC DOT to install cameras at 50 locations throughout New York City. In June 2006, legislation was enacted authorizing an additional 50 cameras. Another 50 cameras, for a total of 150, were authorized in legislation enacted in April 2009.\r\nLearn about paying and contesting red light camera violations from the Department of Finance\n  \n\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\nNews\nTotality angst: Dallas-Fort Worth avoids traffic woes during total solar eclipse\nOfficials issued safety notices, warned of emergency-like conditions and shut down major highway ramps into downtown Dallas in advance of the April 8 eclipse.\nBy Maggie Prosser, Philip Jankowski, Amber Gaudet and Irving Mejia-HilarioStaff Writers\nStaff Writers\nEditor\u2019s note: This story is part of The Dallas Morning News\u2019 coverage of the 2024 total solar eclipse. For more, visit dallasnews.com/eclipse.\nAny given day, the Buc-ee\u2019s in Temple serves as a haven for wayward people, weary travelers and commuters headed to or from Austin or Dallas.\nBut on Monday, the chipper Beaver looming over a stretch of Interstate 35 welcomed visitors to the 124-pump, mega pit stop oasis, offering more than smoked brisket, bathrooms and ample parking: The buck-toothed mascot had front-row seats to a once-in-lifetime celestial event.\n\u201cAfter we scouted the area, we went off our checklist. Gas, food, clean bathrooms,\u201d Shannon Murphy, 41, said. \u201cThat\u2019s Buc-ee\u2019s.\u201d\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\nOr with: \nBy signing up you agree to our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy Policy\nA few cars over, Lucy Valedez crocheted a blanket with stripes of sky blue, lilac, sunflower yellow and light green in her camping chair. Lucy and her husband, Jos\u00e9 Valedez, traveled from Bryan.\n\u201cWe figured, if we\u2019re going to travel, we\u2019d go somewhere that had parking,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Valedez said.\nTravel woes gnawed at eclipse goers ahead of the event Monday, prompting officials to issue safety notices, warn of emergency-like conditions, and even shut down major highway on-ramps into downtown Dallas, fearing traffic jams.\nThe angst came and went as quickly as totality: There were no major traffic problems reported Monday in Dallas, even with the influx of visitors and eclipse chasers. Local hospitals did not immediately report any patients with eye injuries. And the state\u2019s energy reserves held steady.\nThe Texas Department of Transportation predicted 1 million people will have visited the Lone Star state for optimal viewing of the total solar eclipse. The path of totality stretched across more than 480 Texas miles, reaching from the Rio Grande to the Red River.\nAll hands on deck at Buc-ee\u2019s\nAt the Buc-ee\u2019s nearly midway between Austin and Dallas, pitmaster Randy Pauly \u2014 donning Wrangler jeans, a cowboy hat and red and blue Buc-ee\u2019s brand shirt stitched with his name \u2014 handed out eclipse glasses to employees.\nMonday was an all-hands-on-deck situation for Buc-ee\u2019s, Pauly said, akin to the busiest travel days as people fanned out across the area of totality chasing clear skies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Super Bowl weekend for us,\u201d he said. Pauly jumped in a photograph with perhaps the most visible staffer at Buc-ee\u2019s: chief of cutting meat, Ginette Cortes, before she carved up a smoked brisket. Pauly said he expected this location to go through at least 100 briskets Monday, topping about 1,000 pounds of smoked beef rolled up into breakfast tacos and other fare.\nPauly said he wants to show out-of-state visitors \u201ca little bit of Texas.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty wild,\u201d Craig Kleine said of the enormous gas station. Kleine, of Tucson, Ariz., was headed about 90 miles north to Cleburne to view the eclipse. Interstate 35 moved freely throughout the morning, as travelers regularly made stops at the Buc-ee\u2019s pumps or inside the store.\nCommuters had yet to feel the effects, even as hundreds of early birds weaved and snaked in lines outside the Dallas Zoo and the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, staked out lawn spots in Dealey Plaza or on the shores of White Rock Lake, and applied sunscreen under cloudy skies while compulsively checking the weather radar.\nLinda Hampton left about 6:15 a.m. and trekked 43 miles down U.S. Highway 75 to the Dallas Arboretum. Traffic on Dallas-area roads and highways remained light Monday morning and throughout totality, according to TxDOT.\nHampton\u2019s early departure wasn\u2019t out of concern for traffic, rather her husband was responsible for the garden\u2019s petting zoo, and top of mind for her and others was whether the dense clouds would soften by 12:20 p.m., when the eclipse began.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy for the sunshine \u2014 yes, yes, yes, yes!,\u201d said an elated Hampton, 75, as the diamond portion of the eclipse peeked out from behind the clouds, providing an aura of optimism. The initial forecast left some forlorn, worrying the moon\u2019s traversal in front of the sun would be obscured. The outlook began to brighten around lunchtime, but storms and severe weather were expected Monday evening.\nMore than 450,000 visitors\nGlobetrotters journeyed from all corners of the region (Garland, Mansfield, Gun Barrel City and Grand Prairie), the country (California, Florida and New York) and even internationally (Colombia, Germany and France) to witness the first total eclipse in North Texas since 1878.\nEarly estimates from city leaders expected up to a 35% increase in visitors, or more than 450,000 people. More accurate counts may not come until later.\nMinnesotans Ralph and Kim Haefner scooped up a vacation rental last February as hotel reservations were filling up. City officials expected 90% of the city\u2019s roughly 35,000 hotel rooms to be booked by Monday.\n\u201cMillions of years from now, as the moon keeps getting slightly farther and farther away from the Earth over time, it\u2019ll be too small to cover the sun,\u201d said Ralph Haefner, an eclipse chaser. The couple spent early Monday scoping out the best view at Bachman Lake. \u201cIt\u2019s just this weird little coincidence that you can see this amazing spectacle.\u201d\nAstronomy student Andr\u00e9s Torres, 21, traveled to Dallas from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, by way of Miami and Austin to fulfill his dream of witnessing a total eclipse. From Founders Plaza in downtown Dallas, Torres propped up a professional telescope on a tripod.\n\u201cIt was a long trip,\u201d he said. \u201c[The eclipse] is already starting, I\u2019m so excited.\u201d\nAs the eclipse began, Donnie, a 5-year-old pit bull, took refuge under trees and patchy shade near Reunion Tower. Donnie, with his humans Mark Ebanks and Autumn Flowers in tow, made the 14-hour trip from Jacksonville, Fla., on Sunday, arriving in Dallas just after 2 a.m. Monday.\nThe trip was spontaneous, \u201cspur of the moment,\u201d said Ebanks, who didn\u2019t know about the eclipse until Flowers, a self-described space nerd, told him about it last week.\nDonnie, Ebanks and Flowers planned to drive back to Florida after totality ended. They hadn\u2019t given much thought to traffic concerns, other than a potential stop in Louisiana for crawfish.\n\u2018Rolling\u2019 closures of highway exits\nDallas police issued temporary rolling closures of highway exits headed into downtown from about 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. in anticipation of traffic jams as totality ended and people left their viewing spots en masse. Despite the closures, traffic flowed smoothly after the eclipse and there were no issues to report, according to a Dallas police spokesperson.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see a dramatic increase in traffic right after the totality, and I think that indicates that people were just preparing themselves to stay a little bit later and avoid some of that traffic,\u201d Texas Department of Transportation spokesperson Tony Hartzel said.\nThe state\u2019s most critical infrastructure also held strong during the total solar eclipse. ERCOT\u2019s grid never dipped below normal operating conditions during the entirety of the eclipse, a spokesperson told The Dallas Morning News.\nThe state\u2019s top hospitals, including Parkland Health, Baylor Scott & White Health and Methodist Health System, did not report an increase in new patients because of the eclipse Monday afternoon.\nCloud cover at Buc-ee\u2019s\nThe Buc-ee\u2019s pitstop filled with more than 200 people in camping chairs and on picnic blankets; totality came and went with some tension. With minutes to go until full moon cover, low-flying dark clouds blocked visibility. People took off their eclipse glasses amid worried groans as they tried to catch the sliver of the sun as the sky darkened.\nThen, less than a minute before totality, the clouds cleared, the sky darkened and cheers rang out. People settled into their awe and quietly marveled at the orange horizon clearly visible from all sides of the flat, field-lined gargantuan parking lot. A few planets were seen near the sun while the temperature dipped and the solar corona became visible.\n\u201cIt just makes me remember there is so much going on out there,\u201d said Kelsey Appleton, an Atlanta resident there with her parents, Bob and Margaret Appleton, from College Station. \u201cI\u2019m just a part of it.\u201d\n\u201cI just felt like this might be the only chance in my life to see one,\u201d Bob Appleton said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful.\u201d\nWithin 30 minutes, the vast majority of spectators of the cosmic event had left, leaving to clear traffic.\nStaff writers Maria Halkias, Leah Waters, Anna Butler, Nicholas Wooten and Marcela Rodrigues contributed to this report.\nMaggie writes about public safety and criminal courts.

The Scorecard tracks, measures and analyzes traffic congestion in 947 urban areas worldwide, providing insights for road authorities, transportation engineers, policymakers, and the public.\nTraffic congestion occurs when travel demand for roads exceeds the supply of available roadway. While typically viewed in a negative light, traffic congestion is an externality of economic growth and population movement. As more people and economic activity move into urban areas, it places strain on available road capacity, requiring intervention if there is a desire to ameliorate it.\nAdditionally, increased levels of traffic congestion mean more people, deliveries, employees, service workers and truckers, among others, losing time to traffic. It means more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, a reduction in air quality, and lost productivity and economic growth.\nWhile congestion is one barometer of growth, it can also hinder it. Fewer on-time deliveries, fewer goods to market, and a shrinking labor pool are just some outcomes when the impact of traffic congestion hits a certain threshold. While cities, DOTs, road authorities and transit operators work within constrained budgets and red tape, maintenance backlogs grow and key transportation bottlenecks grow more intense.\nHere are the key trends from this year\u2019s Global Traffic Scorecard:\nTrip patterns reveal massive midday \u201c10-4\u201d peak continues. Travel patterns have continued to push toward a midday \u201cnew-normal,\u201d first noted by INRIX back in 2021, that shows morning peak periods have shed some traffic to the midday hours, indicating a more \u201chybrid work\u201d commute pattern.\nINRIX estimates that during the midday travel period, nearly 72 million trips occur per hour, up nearly 23% since 2019, while the evening peak has dropped -9% to 73 million trips per hour. The typical hour during the morning peak sees -12% fewer trips.\nThis should continue to be a key focus of DOT officials and road authorities. Whether adjusting signal timing, adjusting transit schedules or allocating incident response vehicles, the move from the morning peak hours to the midday provides an interesting opportunity reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions.\nTraffic congestion continues to climb. 2023 saw increases in traffic congestion in 78% of the areas analyzed, fell in 19% and stayed the same in 3%. Yet despite the growth, just 54% of areas analyzed have reached their pre-COVID level of traffic congestion.\nMore Time and Economic Impact. The New York Urban Area tops the list, as the typical drivers lost 101 hours to traffic in 2023. This equates to $1,762 in lost time per driver, or $9.1 billion to the urban area. New York is followed by Mexico City (96 hours lost), London (99), Paris (97) and Chicago (96).\nThe typical U.S. driver lost 42 hours to congestion, equal to $733 per driver and $70.4 to the nation as a whole. U.K. drivers lost 61 hours on average, equal to \u00a3558 per driver and \u00a37.5 billion nationally, and drivers in Germany lost 40 hours to traffic on average in 2023, equal to 427 \u20ac and 3.3 billion \u20ac nationally.\nOther important transport statistics/topics. Overall micromobility use rose 8.3% in cities tracked by RideReport, and by Q1 2024 were up 8.6% over Q1 2023.\nThe year saw a couple of high-profile transportation disasters, from fires underneath the I-10 in Los Angeles to the I-95 collapse in Philadelphia. This was followed in 2024 by the collapse of the Key Bridge near Baltimore after it was struck by a cargo ship. However, the quick response of a temporary span on I-95 just a few weeks after the collapse provided a testament to our ability to build and recover.\nMigration continued on a similar path as the COVID recovery in the U.S. as well, with Texas, Florida and the Southern states accounting for 87% of the country\u2019s growth last year.\nPublic transport recovered ridership in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, but all still sit below their pre-COVID levels of ridership. Just seven percent of urban areas in the U.S. tracked by the Federal Transit Administration reached 2019 levels of ridership.\nConclusion\nMany trends are still being ironed out from the massive global disruption that COVID had on the transportation network. Traffic congestion continues to climb while new challenges emerge that also demand attention. The Scorecard reveals the contextual nature of transportation \u2013 its simply not a one size fits all approach. Some cities see trips to downtown stand pat while others see large increases. Many see traffic congestion building on arterials and neighborhood streets while others reveal stronger similarities to more traditional, \u201chub and spoke\u201d travel demand.\nIndustry Overview\nDigital & Trend reports\nOverview and forecasts on trending topics\nIndustry & Market reports\nIndustry and market insights and forecasts\nCompanies & Products reports\nKey figures and rankings about companies and products\nConsumer & Brand reports\nConsumer and brand insights and preferences in various industries\nPolitics & Society reports\nDetailed information about political and social topics\nCountry & Region reports\nAll key figures about countries and regions\nMarket forecast and expert KPIs for 1000+ markets in 190+ countries & territories\nInsights on consumer attitudes and behavior worldwide\nBusiness information on 100m+ public and private companies\nDetailed information for 39,000+ online stores and marketplaces\nDirectly accessible data for 170 industries from 150+ countries and over 1 Mio. facts.\nStatista+ offers additional, data-driven services, tailored to your specific needs.

Three decades ago, the average LA driver spent 66 hours a year in traffic. The 2017 congestion numbers post an 80 percent increase in average hours a year for drivers stuck in traffic.\r\n \r\nWhile LA is famous for its traffic, this is not an LA-specific issue, with cities and towns both big and small posting significant increases in congestion over the past three-plus decades. An expanding nation and, as a result, a growing workforce are both factors at play in the increasing congestion plaguing American roadways. Since 1982, there are 50 percent more people in the workforce, and while people are increasingly working from home, most are still commuting to office space during peak hours. The only year-over-year decrease in congestion was between 2008 and 2009 when the U.S. economy was reeling from the worst economic contraction and high unemployment, the country had seen since the Great Depression.\r\n  \r\nPeople on the roadways pay for this congestion through their time, but the economy pays for these delays through costly inefficiencies. The annual cost of traffic delays per commuter has nearly doubled, rising to $1,010. That is nearly double what it was in the early 1980s.\r\n\n                            \n\n                                        Description\n                                    \n\n                                        This chart shows the annual average hours of delay per commuter during peak hours by U.S. cities.\n                                    \n\n                                            Report\n                                        \n\n                \n                    Can I integrate infographics into my blog or website?\n                \n            \n\n                \n                    Yes, Statista allows the easy integration of many infographics on other websites.

That is nearly double what it was in the early 1980s.\r\n\n                            \n\n                                        Description\n                                    \n\n                                        This chart shows the annual average hours of delay per commuter during peak hours by U.S. cities.\n                                    \n\n                                            Report\n                                        \n\n                \n                    Can I integrate infographics into my blog or website?\n                \n            \n\n                \n                    Yes, Statista allows the easy integration of many infographics on other websites.

To find how many fewer hours the typical driver in New York lost compared to Los Angeles, we subtract the New York hours from the Los Angeles hours: 119 - 101 = 18. Therefore, the typical driver in New York lost 18 fewer hours to traffic compared to the average driver in Los Angeles in 2017.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps: they identify the hours lost in traffic for New York in 2023 and Los Angeles in 2017, then calculate the difference by subtracting the New York hours from the Los Angeles hours. Both solutions arrive at the same numerical result, 18, although Solution 2 presents it as a float (18.0) while Solution 1 presents it as an integer (18). The difference in numerical representation (integer vs. float) does not affect the equivalence of the solutions in terms of reasoning and final answer."

Provisional estimates are published quarterly and remain provisional until after they have been constrained by the final annual estimates each year. These provisional estimates are based on traffic data collected continuously from a network of around 300 automatic traffic counters. Final annual figures also incorporate manual traffic count data.\nTraffic shows a seasonal pattern at the national level, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. This publication focuses on rolling annual traffic totals, which better illustrate medium and long term trends in traffic.\nAnnual traffic estimates are usually published between May and June of the following year. The next provisional figures, for the year ending June 2024, are due to be released in September 2024.\nThese are accredited official statistics[footnote 1] and were independently reviewed by the Office for Statistics Regulation in February 2013. For more information, see the background information on provisional road traffic estimates.\nHeadline figures\nOverall traffic levels in the year ending March 2024 were higher than in year ending March 2023 and below pre-pandemic levels.\nChart 1: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 1 is a line chart showing that 332.4 billion vehicle miles were driven on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was up 2.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motor vehicle traffic levels fell during the pandemic but have since increased. This is the case for all vehicle types and road types. Traffic levels for the year ending March 2024 were 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\nRoad traffic by vehicle type\nChart 2: Share of traffic by vehicle type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 2 is a bar chart which shows that cars accounted for 76% of all motor vehicle traffic on Great Britain\u2019s roads over the year ending March 2024. Therefore, cars continue to be the main contributor to changes in overall motor vehicle traffic.\nThe proportion of van traffic has increased in recent years, accounting for 18% of all motor vehicle traffic in this 12 month period.\nLorries accounted for 5% of all motor vehicle traffic and 1% of traffic came from other motor vehicles including motorcycles and buses.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 1: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by vehicle type in the year ending March 2024, and percentage change compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2501a)\nTable 1 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different vehicle types. For example, car and taxi traffic was 2.6% higher in the year ending March 2024 than the year ending March 2023. Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nCars and taxis\nChart 3: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by cars and taxis in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 3 is a line chart which illustrates that cars and taxis travelled 252.5 billion vehicle miles in the 12 months ending March 2024. Car and taxi traffic rose 2.6% from the year ending March 2023. Car and taxi miles for the year ending March 2024 were down by 4.0% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nVans (Light Commercial Vehicles - LCVs)\nChart 4: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by vans in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 4 is a line chart which shows that 58.2 billion vehicle miles were driven by vans on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was a rise of 1.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Van distance travelled for the year ending March 2024 was 8.8% higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nLorries (Heavy Goods Vehicles - HGVs)\nChart 5: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by lorries in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 5 is a line chart showing that 16.9 billion vehicle miles were driven by lorries on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. Lorry traffic decreased by 2.0% compared to the year ending March 2023. Distance covered by lorries for the year ending March 2024 was 1.7% below pre-pandemic levels. The chart shows that the pandemic had a lesser effect on total lorry traffic than other vehicle types. Between the years ending December 2019 and December 2020, lorry traffic only fell by 5.9%, while car and van traffic fell by 24.9% and 9.2% respectively.\nRoad traffic by road type\nChart 6: Share of traffic by road type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 6 is a bar chart displaying that on Great Britain\u2019s roads, in the year ending March 2024, 21% of motor vehicle miles travelled were on motorways, 44% on \u2018A\u2019 roads, and 35% on minor roads. 65% of motor vehicle miles travelled were on major roads (motorways and \u2018A\u2019 roads) despite comprising only 13% of the road network by length.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 2: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by road type in the year ending March 2024 compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2502a)\nTable 2 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different road types. For example, motorway traffic was 1.9% higher in the year ending March 2024 than the year ending March 2023. Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nMotorways\nChart 7: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on motorways in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 7 is a line chart illustrating that 70.1 billion vehicle miles were driven on motorways in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was an increase of 1.9% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motorway traffic for the year ending March 2024 was similar to pre-pandemic levels.\n\u2018A\u2019 roads\nChart 8: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on \u2018A\u2019 roads in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 8 is a line chart which shows 146.5 billion vehicle miles were driven on \u2018A\u2019 roads in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This represents a 2.6% rise from the year ending March 2023. Traffic on \u2018A\u2019 roads for the year ending March 2024 was 2.5% lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nMinor roads\nChart 9: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on minor roads in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 9 is a line chart showing that 115.8 billion vehicle miles were driven on minor roads in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This represents a 1.6% increase from the year ending March 2023. Distance travelled on minor roads for the year ending March 2024 was 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\nBackground information\nGlossary\nFurther information\nA background quality report has been published for these statistics.

The increase entails trains arriving every 8 to 9 minutes compared to their current schedule of every 10 to 11 minutes.\nPhase two begins in August, with a weekday midday service increase on the C, N, and R lines, which will cut train wait times by 2 minutes. Train service frequency will also increase on the 1 and 6 lines on weekends, with trains arriving every 6 minutes instead of every 8.\nIncreased train frequency will most definitely be a welcome sight this summer, as we all know how miserable the subway gets in the heat, especially considering the subway saw over one billion riders last year.\nBy December phase three will begin, which will increase weekday evening service on the C, N, and R lines as well as midday service on the G line. Trains on these lines will arrive every 8 minutes under the enhanced service.\n6-minute service on the 1 and 6 lines during the weekend will also be extended during this phase to encompass more hours of the day.\nFinally, the fourth and final phase will begin in July 2024. During this phase, weekday and evening service will increase on the B, D, J, and M lines with trains arriving every 8 minutes. The 3 and 5 lines will also see increased weekend service with trains arriving every 10 minutes.\n\u201cThe subway is the lifeblood of New York City, and that is why in this year\u2019s state budget we made sure to deliver the necessary funding not just to shore up the MTA\u2019s financing, but to enhance service as well,\u201d said State Senator Liz Krueger.\nIn addition to the increased service, NYC\u2019s Re-NEW-vation Program aims to renovate a total of 50 subway stations by the end of 2023.\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\nDiscover our cities\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\n\n\nTYPE IN YOUR SEARCH AND PRESS ENTER\nNo result\n",
    "question": "In March 2024, the vehicle miles travelled by cars and taxis in Great Britain were 252.5 billion, and vans travelled 58.2 billion miles. If the MTA allocated $35 million for subway service enhancements in New York for Fiscal Year 2024, what is the total vehicle miles travelled by cars, taxis, and vans in billion miles in Great Britain, divided by the MTA budget in million dollars?",
    "expected_answer": 8.877142857142857,
    "pred_answer": 8877.14,
    "correct": false,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Extracted numerical values from the document\n    car_and_taxi_miles = 252.5  # Billion vehicle miles travelled by cars and taxis in March 2024\n    van_miles = 58.2  # Billion vehicle miles travelled by vans in March 2024\n    mta_budget = 35  # Million dollars allocated for subway service enhancements\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total vehicle miles travelled by cars, taxis, and vans\n    total_vehicle_miles = car_and_taxi_miles + van_miles\n\n    # Step 2: Divide the total vehicle miles by the MTA budget\n    answer = total_vehicle_miles / mta_budget\n\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "No",
    "pred_reasoning": "To find the total vehicle miles travelled by cars, taxis, and vans in Great Britain, we add the miles travelled by cars and taxis (252.5 billion) to the miles travelled by vans (58.2 billion). This gives us a total of 310.7 billion vehicle miles. We then divide this total by the MTA budget of $35 million to find the ratio of vehicle miles to the budget. The calculation is 310.7 billion miles / 35 million dollars = 8877.14 billion miles per million dollars.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Solution 1 calculates the total vehicle miles by adding car_and_taxi_miles and van_miles, resulting in 310.7 billion miles. It then divides this by the MTA budget of 35 million dollars, yielding a result of 8.877142857142857 billion miles per million dollars. Solution 2 follows the same steps: it adds the same values to get 310.7 billion miles and divides by the same budget, resulting in 8877.14 billion miles per million dollars. The discrepancy in the final answer is due to Solution 1 not converting the result to the same unit as Solution 2. Solution 1's answer is in billions, while Solution 2's answer is in billions per million dollars. Therefore, the solutions are not equivalent."

Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nCars and taxis\nChart 3: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by cars and taxis in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 3 is a line chart which illustrates that cars and taxis travelled 252.5 billion vehicle miles in the 12 months ending March 2024. Car and taxi traffic rose 2.6% from the year ending March 2023. Car and taxi miles for the year ending March 2024 were down by 4.0% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nVans (Light Commercial Vehicles - LCVs)\nChart 4: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by vans in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 4 is a line chart which shows that 58.2 billion vehicle miles were driven by vans on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was a rise of 1.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Van distance travelled for the year ending March 2024 was 8.8% higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nLorries (Heavy Goods Vehicles - HGVs)\nChart 5: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by lorries in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 5 is a line chart showing that 16.9 billion vehicle miles were driven by lorries on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. Lorry traffic decreased by 2.0% compared to the year ending March 2023. Distance covered by lorries for the year ending March 2024 was 1.7% below pre-pandemic levels.

    "question": "In March 2024, 115.8 billion vehicle miles were driven on minor roads in Great Britain. Given that 2.9 million subway riders in New York are expected to benefit from the weekend service increase starting in July 2023, what is the ratio of vehicle miles on minor roads in billion miles to the number of weekend riders benefiting in million riders?",
    "expected_answer": 39.93103448275862,

    "correct": true,
    "llm_annotate_reasoning": "def solve():\n    # Extracted numerical values from the document\n    minor_road_miles = 115.8  # Billion vehicle miles on minor roads in March 2024\n    weekend_riders = 2.9  # Million subway riders benefiting from weekend service increase\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the ratio of vehicle miles on minor roads to the number of weekend riders benefiting\n    answer = minor_road_miles / weekend_riders\n\n    return answer",
    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "To find the ratio of vehicle miles on minor roads in billion miles to the number of weekend riders benefiting in million riders, we divide the number of vehicle miles (115.8 billion) by the number of riders (2.9 million). This gives us the ratio: 115.8 / 2.9 = 39.93103448275862.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions involve the same reasoning steps: they extract the numerical values for vehicle miles on minor roads and the number of weekend riders benefiting. They then calculate the ratio by dividing the vehicle miles by the number of riders. Both solutions arrive at the same final numerical answer of 39.93103448275862. Therefore, the solutions are equivalent in terms of reasoning and final answer."

For the first time, AAA looked at the entire July 4th week, plus the Saturday before and the Sunday after the holiday. This year\u2019s projected number of travelers for that time period is a 5% increase compared to 2023 and an 8% increase over 2019.\n\u201cWith summer vacations in full swing and the flexibility of remote work, more Americans are taking extended trips around Independence Day,\u201d said Paula Twidale, Senior Vice President of AAA Travel. \u201cWe anticipate this July 4th week will be the busiest ever with an additional 5.7 million people traveling compared to 2019.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAAA projects a record 60.6 million people will travel by car over Independence Day week \u2013 that\u2019s an additional 2.8 million travelers compared to last year. This year\u2019s number also surpasses 2019 when 55.3 million people traveled by car over July 4th week. AAA car rental partner Hertz says Dallas, Denver, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are the cities displaying the highest rental demand during the holiday week. The busiest pick-up days are projected to be Friday, June 28, Saturday, June 29, and Wednesday, July 3.\u00a0\u00a0\nGas prices are lower than last year when the national average was $3.53. Pump prices will likely continue going down leading up to Independence Day.\u00a0 At that point, they will likely level off and remain relatively stable until after Labor Day, similar to last year.\u00a0 An important caveat is hurricane season \u2013 underway now \u2013 which could affect gas prices should a storm negatively impact Gulf Coast oil production and refining centers.\u00a0\nThe number of air travelers is also expected to set a new record. AAA projects 5.74 million people will fly to their July 4th destinations. That\u2019s an increase of nearly 7% compared to last year and a 12% increase over 2019. AAA booking data shows domestic airfare is 2% cheaper this Independence Day week compared to last year, and the average price for a domestic roundtrip ticket is $800. Airports will be packed throughout the week. AAA recommends arriving 2 hours early, reserving parking ahead of time, and traveling with carry-on luggage versus checked bags to save time and money.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore than 4.6 million people are expected to travel by other modes of transportation, including buses, cruises, and trains. This category is seeing an increase of 9% compared to last year, but this year\u2019s number is shy of 2019\u2019s figure of 4.79 million. Cruising continues its remarkable post-pandemic comeback. This time of year, Alaska cruises are in high demand, making Seattle and Anchorage top domestic destinations. Cruise travelers are also finding deals this summer. With new ships coming onto the market \u2013 and going for a premium \u2013 some cruise lines have been offering targeted discounts to fill older inventory for remaining cabins.\u00a0\nBest/Worst Times to Drive and Peak Congestion by Metro\u00a0\nINRIX, a provider of transportation data and insights, says the worst times to travel by car before and on July 4th are between 2pm and 7pm. Drivers should hit the road in the morning, and travelers returning on Monday, July 8th should avoid rush hour traffic in the morning and afternoon.\u00a0\n\u201cDrivers in large metro areas can expect the worst traffic delays on Wednesday, July 3rd, as they leave town, and Sunday, July 7th, as they return,\u201d said Bob Pishue, transportation analyst at INRIX. \u201cRoad trips over the holiday week could take up to 67% longer than normal. Travelers should monitor 511 services, local news stations, and traffic apps for up-to-the-minute road conditions.\u201d\u00a0\nPlease note that the times listed below are for the time zone in which the metro is located.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor example, Atlanta routes = ET and Los Angeles routes = PT.\u00a0\nSource: INRIX\u00a0\nIncrease\u00a0\nCompared to Typical\u00a0\nSunday 7th\u00a0\u00a0\n6:30 PM\u00a0\nThursday 4th\u00a0\u00a0\n1:45 PM\u00a0\nWednesday 3rd \n2:45 PM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n7:30 AM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n3:30 PM\u00a0\nSaturday 6th\u00a0\u00a0\n1:30 PM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n2:15 PM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n4:45 PM\u00a0\nSunday 7th\u00a0\u00a0\n2:15 PM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n8:30 AM\u00a0\nWednesday 3rd\n 5:00 PM\u00a0\nThursday 4th\u00a0\u00a0\n6:00 PM\u00a0\nTuesday 2nd\u00a0\u00a0\n5:45 PM\u00a0\nSunday 7th\u00a0\u00a0\n4:30 PM\u00a0\nWednesday 3rd \n10:15 AM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n3:15 PM\u00a0\nSource: INRIX\u00a0\n\u00a0Top Destinations\u00a0\nThis July 4th week, travelers are cooling off in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska \u2013 and by the ocean! Seattle, Vancouver, and Anchorage are top destinations because of the popularity of Alaska cruises this time of year. Beaches in South Florida, Honolulu, Punta Cana, and Barcelona are in high demand. Historical sites in European cities like London, Rome, Dublin, Paris, and Athens are also popular. The top 10 domestic and international destinations below are based on AAA booking data.\u00a0\nFamily Road Trip Checklist\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWith road trips expected to set a new record this July 4th week, AAA teamed up with Chicco to share safety tips for families with young children. \u00a0\nHoliday Forecast Methodology\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nTravel Forecast\u202f\u00a0\nIn cooperation with AAA, S&P Global Market Intelligence (SPGMI) developed a unique methodology to forecast actual domestic travel volumes. The economic variables used to forecast travel for the current holiday are leveraged from SPGMI\u2019s proprietary databases. These data include macroeconomic drivers such as employment, output, household net worth, asset prices, including stock indices, interest rates, housing market indicators, and variables related to travel and tourism, including gasoline prices, airline travel, and hotel stays. AAA and SPGMI have quantified holiday travel volumes going back to 2000.\u202f\u00a0\nHistorical travel volume estimates come from DK SHIFFLET\u2019s TRAVEL PERFORMANCE/MonitorSM. The PERFORMANCE/MonitorSM is a comprehensive study measuring the travel behavior of U.S. residents. DK SHIFFLET contacts over 50,000 U.S. households each month to obtain detailed travel data, resulting in the unique ability to estimate visitor volume and spending, identify trends, and forecast U.S. travel behavior, all after the trips have been taken.\u00a0\nThe travel forecast is reported in person-trips. In particular, AAA and SPGMI forecast the total U.S. holiday travel volume and expected mode of transportation. The travel forecast presented in this report was prepared the week of May 27, 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\nBecause AAA forecasts focus on domestic leisure travel only, comparisons to TSA passenger screening numbers should not be made. TSA data includes all passengers traveling on both domestic and international routes. Additionally, TSA screens passengers each time they enter secured areas of the airport, therefore each one-way trip is counted as a passenger tally. AAA focuses on person-trips, which include the full round-trip travel itinerary. As a result, direct comparisons of AAA forecast volumes and daily TSA screenings represent different factors.\u00a0\n*Independence Day Holiday Travel Period\u00a0\u00a0\nFor this forecast, the Independence Day holiday travel period is defined as the nine-day period from Saturday, June 29 to Sunday, July 7. Historically, the Independence Day holiday period included only one weekend. This is the first year the Independence Day holiday travel period is a longer timeframe with two weekends included.\u00a0\nAbout AAA\u202f\u00a0\nStarted in 1902 by automotive enthusiasts who wanted to chart a path for better roads in America and advocate for safe mobility, AAA has transformed into one of North America\u2019s largest membership organizations.

While exact weather conditions typically can\u2019t be predicted more than a week in advance, here\u2019s a seasonal outlook to help you prepare for what fall will bring.\nReminder: The first day of fall is on Sunday, Sept. 22.\n\nThe western coastline is the only place in the entire US that doesn\u2019t have a high chance of seeing above average temperatures this fall.\nMap via National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Prediction Center\nTemperature\nIt\u2019s a toss-up. This fall, Seattle has equal chances of temperatures being higher or lower than normal.\nPrecipitation\nExpect slightly more precipitation. Seattle has a 40-50% chance of seeing above average rainfall amounts this fall.\nBy the month: September\nTypically, the cooling off begins with daily high temperatures averaging around 67\u00b0. However, NOAA has forecasted a 66% chance of a La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern beginning sometime between September and November, which typically brings wetter + chillier temps to the Pacific Northwest.\nAlso, while our daylight hours will become outweighed by the ones we spend in the dark following the Fall Equinox, we\u2019ll still be getting a solid 12 hours in the sun for a while. Soak it up while you can.\nBy the month: October\nOctober plunges us down into a daily high temperature average of 59\u00b0. It will definitely be sweater weather by this point.\nBy the month: November\nWe\u2019ll lead into turkey carving season with a daily high temperature average of 51\u00b0. This month also brings us the dreaded end of Daylight Savings Time on Sunday, Nov. 3. On this day, we\u2019ll see a 7 a.m. sunrise and the return of the infamous 4 p.m. sunsets.

(Table 2.1).\nThe worst traffic days experienced in Washington can be explained by the occurrence and combination of different events.\nAnother example of the irregularity in event occurrence can be seen in the frequency and duration of traffic incidents.\nFigure 2.1 shows how traffic incidents occurred on a 14-mile stretch of Interstate 405 in Seattle, Washington during peak travel periods for the first four months of 2003.\nSome days are relatively incident-free while others have numerous traffic incidents.\nInterestingly, at least one traffic incident occurred every day during the peaks on this highway.\nSo, while some days are better than others, traffic incidents are an unavoidable fact on crowded urban freeways.\nAnother source of variability is traffic demand, which is rarely the same from day-to-day.\nOn routes heavily used for commuting, weekday traffic is typically much higher than weekend traffic.\n(On routes in recreational, tourist, or shopping-dominated areas, weekend traffic higher.)\nFigure 2.2 shows this variability in dramatic fashion for Detroit freeways.\nIt also shows that there is some variability on weekdays:\nThursdays and Fridays are typically the highest traffic days for this period.\nThe congestion and travel time variability caused by planned special events are becoming a major concern for transportation agencies.\nIn a recent survey of state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and the American Highway Users Alliance, special events were cited as significant contributors to noncommuter congestion.\nThese events may be categorized as:\nTable 2.1\tFactors Contributing to Extreme Congestion\nTen Worst Days of Washington, D.C. Traffic\nSource:\tVasudevan, Meenakshy; Wunderlich, Karl E., Shah, Vaisshali; and Larkin, James, Effectiveness of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) Under Extreme Congestion:\nFindings from a Washington, D.C., Case Study, proceedings of ITS America, 2004.\nThe events that impede traffic flow and cause travel to be unreliable often occur in combination.\nThis diagram shows the number of days when different combinations of events occurred during the study period.\nFor example, there were three days when incidents occurred\u2014on two of these days only incidents occurred and on one day, incidents occurred in combination with high demand and bad weather.\nAs most commuters know, \"some days are worse than others.\"\nPile high demand (say, a Friday before a three-day weekend) on top of heavy rain and a lane-blocking crash, and you've got the ingredients for severe congestion.\nFigure 2.1\tThe Number and Duration of Incidents Varies Greatly from\nDay to Day\nI-405 Southbound, Seattle, Washington\nNote:\tData shown are for the morning and afternoon peak periods (7:00-10:00 a.m. and 4:00-7:00 p.m.) for the period from January 1, 2003 to April 30, 2003.\nTraffic incidents occur in a fairly erratic pattern from day-to-day.\nAlso, how long they last and how many lanes they block are fairly unpredictable.\nThis erratic behavior contributes significantly to making travel unreliable for travelers.\nFigure 2.2\tTraffic Levels Vary Substantially over the Course of a Week\nDetroit Freeways, 3/11/2001 - 4/7/2001\nNote:\tVMT (or \"vehicle-miles of travel\") is a common measure of highway usage.\nIt is calculated as the number of vehicles using the system times the distance they travel.\nFor the time period displayed, Sundays are the low points on the graph.\nWeekday travel can be more than 60 percent higher than Sunday travel.\nOn weekdays, the trend toward highway travel later in the week (Thursdays and Fridays) is common in most urban areas.\nWhile commuting trips are relatively stable throughout the week, discretionary trips are higher as the weekend approaches.\nAs if the congestion picture was not complicated enough, consider further that some events can cause others to occur.\nFor example:\nAll of this suggests the rather complex model of congestion shown in Figures 2.3a and 2.3b.\nFrom a practical standpoint, what is important to take away from this model are two notions:\n1) the sources of congestion can be tightly interconnected, and 2) because of the interconnectedness, significant payoffs can be expected by treating the sources.\nThat is, by treating one source, you can reduce the impact of that source on congestion plus have a partial impact on others.\nThe exact causal relationships among the sources of congestion are not yet well known, but consider the data shown in Figure 2.4.\nDisplayed in this figure is the relationship between delay (both bottleneck- and incident-related) and traffic intensity.\nSeveral observations can be made from these data:\nFigure 2.3\tAnatomy of Congestion\nFigure 2.3a Part 1 - Traffic Volumes Interact with Physical Capacity to Produce \"Base Delay\"\n= Source of Congestion\nNote:\tThe starting point for congestion on most days is the amount of traffic and the physical restrictions on the highway (bottlenecks).\nTraffic varies from day-to-day throughout the year and special events may cause surges in traffic at unexpected times.\nSee Figure 2.2 as an example of how much traffic varies even over as short a period as a month.\nFigure 2.3\tAnatomy of Congestion (continued)\nFigure 2.3b Part 2 - Roadway Events Reduce Available Capacity and Add Extra Delay to the System\n= Source of Congestion\nNote:\tJust as traffic varies across time periods, so does physical capacity.\nThe operation of traffic signals changes capacity, often minute-to-minute.\nWhen roadway events occur, they also cause the physical capacity of the roadway to be lowered.\n(Traffic incidents and work zones can \"steal\" lanes, and bad weather causes drivers to space themselves out more.) Base-level congestion caused by bottlenecks can lead to increased traffic incidents due to tighter vehicle spacing and vehicles overheating in summer.\nFinally, the existence of extreme congestion can cause some drivers to change their routes or to forego trips altogether.\nUnderstanding how all these factors interact is the subject of ongoing research.\nFigure 2.4\tRelationship of Incident and Bottleneck Delay to Traffic Intensity\nNote:\tThe AADT/C level is a general indicator of the \"intensity\" of traffic trying to use a highway with fixed capacity.\nAADT is Annual Average Daily Traffic (vehicles per day) and C is the two-way capacity of the roadway (vehicles per hour).\nBottleneck and traffic incident delay occur differently:\nbottlenecks cause delay at specific points while traffic incidents may occur anywhere along a highway segment.\nThis is the reason for using 5- and 10-mile segments for the traffic incident delay above.\nThe analysis shows that as traffic grows on a roadway with fixed capacity, traffic incident delay is initially higher than bottleneck delay.\nAs traffic grows, bottleneck delay overtakes traffic incident delay, because it happens fairly regularly while traffic incidents vary in occurrence and characteristics.\nThis analysis also shows the interrelationship between the sources of delay identified in Figures 2.3a and 2.3b.\nEven with no changes in traffic incident characteristics, traffic incident delay grows as more traffic is added to a roadway.\nIn other words, as the traffic level grows on a base of fixed capacity, the roadway is more vulnerable to disruptions caused by traffic incidents, or any other traffic-influencing event for that matter.\nThe exponential growth in bottleneck delay after the onset of congestion is a major reason why it is so difficult for agencies to keep up with congestion:\nonce it starts, things get bad quickly.\nIntroducing an extra vehicle to congested conditions means not only does that vehicle get delayed, it also adds extra delay to any other vehicles that join after it.\nThe fact that both bottleneck- and incident-related delay increase with base congestion level indicates that if physical capacity is increased, congestion for both sources would be decreased.\nIn other words, Facilities with greater base capacity are less vulnerable to disruptions:\na traffic incident that blocks a single lane has a greater impact on a highway with two travel lanes than a highway with three travel lanes.\nThis feature highlights the interdependence of the sources mentioned above.\nIt also reinforces the notion that adding physical capacity is a viable option for improving congestion, especially when made in conjunction with other strategies.\nWhat Is Travel Time Reliability?\nBy its very nature, roadway performance is at the same time consistent and repetitive, and yet highly variable and unpredictable.\nIt is consistent and repetitive in that peak usage periods occur regularly and can be predicted with a high degree of reliability.\n(The relative size and timing of \"rush hour\" is well known in most communities.)\nAt the same time, it is highly variable and unpredictable, in that on any given day, unusual circumstances such as crashes can dramatically change the performance of the roadway, affecting both travel speeds and throughput volumes.\nThe traveling public experiences these large performance swings, and their expectation or fear of unreliable traffic conditions affects both their view of roadway performance, and how and when they choose to travel.\nFor example, if a road is known to have highly variable traffic conditions, a traveler using that road to catch an airplane routinely leaves lots of \"extra\" time to get to the airport.\nIn other words, the \"reliability\" of this traveler's trip is directly related to the variability in the performance of the route she or he takes.\nIt is becoming clear that we can no longer just define congestion in terms of \"average\" or \"typical\" conditions.\nOne of the reasons was identified in Figure 2.4\u2014as the traffic on a fixed capacity roadway, a highway becomes more susceptible to delay from traffic incidents, and in fact, to all traffic-influencing events.\nBecause reliability indicates how much events influence traffic conditions, it is particularly important when it comes to defining operations strategies, which aim to control the effect of these events.\nHighlight Box 2 \u2013 Measuring Reliability\nBecause reliability is defined by how travel times vary over time, it is useful to develop frequency distributions to see how much variability exists.\nCalculating the average travel time and the size of the \"buffer\"\u2014the extra time needed by travelers to ensure a high rate of on-time arrival\u2014then helps us to develop a variety of reliability measures.\nThese measures include the Buffer Index, the Planning Time, and the Planning Time Index (see Figure 2.5).\nThey are all based on the same underlying distribution of travel times, but describe reliability in slightly different ways:\nFigure 2.5\tDistribution of Travel Times, State Route 520 Seattle,\nEastbound, 4:00-7:00 p.m. Weekdays (11.5 Miles Long)\nWith this discussion in mind, from a practical standpoint, travel time reliability can be defined in terms of how travel times vary over time (e.g., hour-to-hour, day-to-day).\nCommuters who take congested highways to and from work are well aware of this.\nWhen asked about their commutes, they will say things like:\n\"it takes me 45 minutes on a good day, but an hour and 15 minutes on a bad day.\"\nFigure 2.6 typifies this experience with data from State Route (SR) 520, a major commuter route, in Seattle, Washington.\nIf there was no congestion on this 11.5 mile segment, travel times would be around 11 1/2 minutes; on President's Day this was the case.\nOn other days, the average travel time was 17.5 minutes, or an average speed of 40 mph.\nBut when events (traffic incidents and weather) are present, it could take nearly 25 minutes, or 37 percent longer.\nCommuters who take SR 520 corridor must plan for this unpredictable variability if they want to arrive on time\u2014the average just will not do.\nFigure 2.6\tWeekday Travel Times\n5:00-6:00 p.m., on State Route 520 Eastbound, Seattle, Washington\nIn other words, they have to build in a buffer to their trip planning to account for the variability.\nIf they build in a buffer, they will arrive early on some days, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but the extra time is still carved out of their day.\nAnd this is time they could be using for other pursuits besides commuting.\nWhat Value Does Providing Reliable Travel Times Have?\nImproving the reliability of travel times is significant for a number of reasons:\nDespite our simple definition of travel time reliability as the variation in travel times over history, different perspectives exist:\nAs we have already seen, some days are better (or worse) than others in terms of congestion, and there is quite a bit of variation from average or typical conditions on any given day.\nFigure 2.7 displays this variation from the traveler and operator points of view.\nShown are travel times in the heavily congested I 75 corridor in central Atlanta for all Thursdays in 2003.\nThe average and 95th percentile travel times are shown along with the actual travel times from two specific Thursdays.\nJanuary 16 was clearly a \"bad\" day in this corridor while September 4 was \"better than average.\"\nFor both travelers and operators, a constantly updated display of travel conditions compared to baselines would be valuable information to have.\nIn fact, at least one traffic management center (Houston TRANSTAR) posts this sort of information on their web site in real-time.9\nIt should be noted that currently we do not have the ability to predict what is going to happen\u2014a difficult task given the uncertainty of unpredictable events like incidents or sudden, intense weather.\nWe can only compare what is happening now to historical conditions, but research is currently underway on this topic.\nStill, the ability to predict with some certainty what travel time will be in the near future is of great interest to operators and travelers.\nWhy is this important?\nIf a commuter has a routine activity that must occur every day\u2014such as picking up children from day care\u2014they must plan on an extra amount of trip time just to be sure they do not arrive late.\nThe same goes for local trucking firms engaged in pickup and delivery of goods.\nLooking again at the data in Figure 2.7, if a traveler starts in the corridor at 5:30 p.m., on the average Thursday the trip will take about 12 minutes.\nBut history has shown that to be safe, they have to plan for about 18 minutes (50 percent more) to have only a small chance of arriving late; they have to build in a buffer.\nThese are not huge numbers\u2014but this is a short corridor (4 miles).\nThe difference is, however, a large percentage.\nIf similar conditions exist over the rest of the commute, then the extra time starts to add up quickly.\nWith this simple approach, an extreme event can cause great problems for an individual trip, but at least we can compute a reasonable probability of arriving on time.\nFigure 2.7\tIs It a Good Day or Bad Day for Commuting:\nComparing Current Travel Times to Historical Conditions\nI-75 Southbound Central Atlanta, Thursdays, 2003\nNote:\tComparing what is happening on the highway system right now to \"typical\" (average) and \"extreme\" (95th percentile) conditions provides both operators and travelers with information that can lead to actions.\nFor example, the afternoon of September 4, travelers could see that congestion was lighter than usual and could schedule additional activities.\nJanuary 16 on the other hand was a heavy congestion day and as it unfolded, operators could post diversion messages to try to control it.\nPlanners are most interested in how things change over a longer period of time, though the question of \"are things getting better or worse\" is of general interest as well.\nIn the I 75 corridor in central Atlanta, travel times in the afternoon peak period have increased and reliability has decreased between 2001 and 2003 (Figure 2.8).\nMonitoring of performance trends like this is becoming more common at transportation agencies.\nAs discussed in the next section, performance monitoring is a major emphasis in operations and planning.\nFigure 2.8\tCongestion and Unreliable Travel Have Increased on\nI-75 Southbound in Central Atlanta, Georgia\nThursdays, 2001 and 2003\nNote:\tBy comparing the average travel times in 2001 and 2003 (the blue lines)), it can be seen that average congestion levels have increased in this corridor.\nAt the same time, travel time reliability has decreased, as shown by the increase in the 95th percentile travel times.\n2.3\tTRACKING CONGESTION\n2.3.1\tWhy Monitor Congestion?\nMonitoring congestion is just one of the several aspects of transportation system performance that leads to more effective investment decisions for transportation improvements.\nSafety, physical condition, environmental quality, economic development, quality of life, and customer satisfaction are among the aspects of performance that also require monitoring.10\nCongestion is intertwined with all of these other categories since higher congestion levels have been associated with their degradation.\nIn addition to facilitating better investments, improved monitoring of congestion can lead to several positive outcomes:\nThe performance of the highway system in terms of how efficiently users can traverse it may be described in three basic terms:\ncongestion, mobility, and accessibility.\nWhile researchers have different definitions of these terms, we have found it useful to define them as follows:\nCongestion and mobility are very closely related and the same metrics and concepts can be used to monitor both.\nAccessibility is a relatively new concept and requires a different set of metrics.\nMost the data that are currently available describe facility performance, not trip performance, although new technologies are emerging that will allow for direct monitoring of entire trips.\nOne of the principles that FHWA has established for monitoring congestion as part of its annual performance plan is that meaningful congestion performance measures must be based on the measurement of travel time.\nTravel times are easily understood by practitioners and the public, and are applicable to both the user and facility perspectives of performance.\nTemporal Aspects of Congestion:\nMeasuring congestion by times of the day and day of week has a long history in transportation.\nA relatively new twist on this is the definition of a weekday \"peak period\"\u2014multiple hours rather than the traditional peak hour.\nIn many metropolitan areas, particularly the larger ones, congestion now lasts three or more hours each weekday morning and evening.\nIn other words, over time, congestion has spread into more hours of the day as commuters leave earlier or later to avoid the traditional rush hour.\nDefinition of peak periods is critical in performing comparisons.\nFor example, consider a three-hour peak period.\nIn smaller cities, congestion may usually only last for one hour\u2014better conditions in the remaining two hours will \"dilute\" the metrics.\nOne way around this is not to establish a fixed time period in which to measure congestion, but rather determine how long congestion exists (e.g., percent of time where operating conditions are below a threshold.)\nSpatial Aspects of Congestion:\nCongestion spreads not only in time but in space as well.\nQueues from physical bottlenecks and major traffic-influencing events (like traffic incidents) can extend for many miles.\nCongestion measures need to be sensitive to this by tracking congestion over facilities or corridors, rather than just short highway segments.\nTable 2.2 presents a small sample of congestion performance measures (metrics) that can be used by agencies to monitor trends.\nFor a specific road section and time period:\nBuffer Index (%) =\nFigure 2.9 shows how travel times can be developed from data, analytic methods, or a combination.\nClearly, the best methods are based on direct measurement of travel times, either through probe vehicles or the more traditional \"floating car\" method, in which data collectors drive specific routes.\nHowever, both of these have drawbacks:\nprobe vehicles currently are not widely deployed and the floating car method suffers from extremely small samples because it is expensive and time consuming.\nFurther, since many performance measures require traffic volumes as well, additional collection effort is required to develop the full suite of performance measures.\nUse of ITS roadway equipment addresses these issues, but this equipment does not measure travel time directly; ITS spot speeds must be converted to travel times first.\n(The Appendix provides a description of the equipment used to collect these data.)\nOther indirect methods of travel time estimation use traffic volumes as a basis, either those that are directly measured or developed with travel demand forecasting models.\nTwo examples of how FHWA is developing travel times with these methods follow.\nFigure 2.9\tMeasuring Travel Time Is the Basis for Congestion Measures\nSince 2000, FHWA has been assembling volume and speed data from urban traffic management centers.\nThese data are primarily from ITS roadway equipment, although some cities are exploring the use of probe vehicles to capture travel time.\nData from 29 cities are currently obtained annually from participating traffic management centers.\nSome of these cities are now providing data on a monthly basis, and these monthly data are used to track citywide trends month-by-month.\nFigure 2.10 shows an example of how these data are presented.\nAs more cities participate\u2014and as surveillance coverage increases in existing cities\u2014these data will provide a way for FHWA to monitor monthly changes in congestion.\n(Section 3.0 presents additional analysis of the data used in this program.)\nFigure 2.10\tExample of the Newly Designed Urban Congestion Report\nUsed by FHWA to Track Monthly Changes in Congestion\nThe tracking of congestion within cities is dependent on having an intensive system of surveillance to collect vehicle speeds (through roadway detectors) or travel times (using toll-tagged probe vehicles) at closely spaced points on the roadway.\nOutside of major metropolitan areas, such surveillance does not exist.\nTo complement urban congestion measures and get a better picture of total system performance, FHWA is developing a system to monitor truck travel on intercity corridors that have significant freight volumes.\nFHWA is partnering with the American Transportation Research Institute and the trucking industry to use existing satellite-based systems that track truck movement for freight and fleet management purposes to support transport system performance measurement.\nAdditionally, FHWA is exploring using similar methods to measure delay at major international border crossings.\nFigure 2.11 shows an example of how this system has been applied to develop travel times on 10-mile stretches of Interstate 5.\nFigure 2.11\tInterstate 5 Average Travel Rate for Trucks:\n10-Mile Segments\nApril-June 2004, 3:00-7:00 p.m.\n2.4\tCONGESTION'S CONSEQUENCES\nThe nation's local, regional, and national transportation systems play a vital role in creating access to goods and services which sustain and grow our nation's economy.\nPlanners and economic development experts recognize that congestion is an economic development issue because it thwarts business attraction and expansion, and reduces the quality of life for residents.\nTransportation system users have developed strategies to deal with increased congestion and reduced reliability.\nIn the short term, we might change our mode or time of travel.\nOver the longer run, congestion might influence our decisions about where we live and work.\nThe same holds true for businesses.\nThese types of adjustments might reduce the impacts of congestion to us, but they still do not entirely eliminate the economic consequences for a region.\nTrucking Impacts.\nCongestion means longer travel times and less reliable pick-up and delivery times for truck operators.\nTo compensate, motor carriers typically add vehicles and drivers and extend their hours of operation, eventually passing the extra costs along to shippers and consumers.\nResearch on the trucking industry has shown that shippers and carriers value transit time in the range of $25 to $200 per hour, depending on the product being carried.\nThe cost of unexpected delay can add another 20 percent to 250 percent.11\nImpacts on Businesses.\nCongestion increases the costs of delivering goods and services, because of the increased travel times and operating costs incurred on the transportation system.\nLess obviously, there may be are other costs, such as:\nThe business value of time delay and market access act together to affect the profitability and revenue potential associated with doing business in a state or region.\nWhen one area is affected by congestion more than others, the relative competitiveness of these areas also shifts.\nThe result, then, is that businesses tend to stagnate or move out of areas with high operating costs and limited markets, while they locate and expand in areas with lower operating costs and broader market connections.\nThe magnitude of these changes varies by industry, based on how strongly the industry's total operating cost is affected by transportation factors.\nThe evidence seems to indicate that regional economies that are fostered by clusters or \"agglomerations\" of many interrelated firms are better positioned to counter the higher operating costs due to congestion than economies that are not.\nHousehold Impacts.\nHouseholds have both financial budgets and what is termed \"time budgets\" that are both impacted by congestion.\nHouseholds plan their activities around the available time budget as well as around their financial budgets.\nAs vehicle operating and maintenance costs increase with rising congestion, the budget for some types of activities or expenditures decreases.\nThe perceived \"quality of life\" of a neighborhood is diminished as well, when the safety, reliability and the convenience of the transportation system decreases.\nRegional Impacts.\nRegional economies are affected by these household and business-specific impacts.\nDiminished cost competitiveness and market growth opportunities are tantamount to a reduced ability to retain, grow, and attract businesses.\nAdditionally, the redistribution of business and household activity to outlying areas and the direct delay for trips that are not diverted or otherwise changed both lead to decreases in air quality, increases in public infrastructure investment requirements, and potential impacts on health and quality of life factors.12\nBack to Top\nPrevious | Table of Contents | Next\nUS DOT Home\u00a0| FHWA\nHome\u00a0|

    "llm_judge": "Yes",
    "pred_reasoning": "From the Long-Context Documents, the average high temperature in Seattle for November is 51\u00b0F. The number of traffic incidents on I-405 is not directly provided, but the document mentions that traffic incidents occur every day during peak periods. Assuming a baseline of 1 incident per day, a 37% increase due to congestion variability would result in 1.37 incidents per day. The product of the average high temperature and the average daily number of traffic incidents is 51 * 1.37 = 69.87.",
    "judge_reasoning": "Both solutions follow the same reasoning steps and arrive at the same final answer. They both start by identifying the average high temperature in Seattle for November as 51\u00b0F and assume a baseline of 1 traffic incident per day on I-405. They then account for a 37% increase in incidents due to congestion variability, resulting in 1.37 incidents per day. Finally, both solutions calculate the product of the temperature and the adjusted incident rate, yielding the same final answer of 69.87."
